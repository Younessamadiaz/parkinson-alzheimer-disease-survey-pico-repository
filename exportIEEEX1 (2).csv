This project investigates the effectiveness of EEG-based features for detecting Alzheimer’s Disease using deep learning techniques. The dataset comprises EEG recordings from healthy controls, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) patients, and patients diagnosed with AD. Data preprocessing involved segmenting the EEG signals into fixed-length epochs and filtering the baseline EEG into alpha, beta, and theta frequency bands. Features such as Mean Phase Coherence (MPC), Differential Entropy (DE), and Mean Squared Coherence (MSC) were computed pairwise for each epoch and frequency band. A feature matrix was constructed for each subject by stacking these features, which were then converted into images and used as input data for a ResNet50-based pre-trained model. The model was tested in leave-one-out cross-validation setting and achieved results comparable to the state-of-the-art in distinguishing between EEG recordings from healthy and AD-affected subjects.","2572-7621","979-8-3503-4020-4","10.1109/R10-HTC59322.2024.10778722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10778722","Alzheimer’s disease (AD);Front Temporal Dementia (FTD);deep learning;classification;electroencephalogram (EEG)","Deep learning;Computational modeling;Coherence;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Data models;Recording;Reliability;Alzheimer's disease","","","","8","IEEE","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach leverages various medical imaging modalities such as MRI, PET, CT, and fMRI, alongside clinical data like cognitive test results and biomarkers, to assess brain changes associated with Alzheimer's. The focus is on classifying the disease into three stages: Mild, Moderate, and Severe, using advanced machine learning models. Deep learning techniques, such as EfficientNet B7 for 2D imaging and 3D CNNs for volumetric data, enable efficient feature extraction from medical scans. Additionally, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with GRU layers are used to capture temporal patterns from longitudinal data, improving predictive accuracy. Hybrid models, combining CNNs with attention mechanisms, further enhance classification. The model uses a multi-class classification approach with Softmax activation to predict the likelihood of each stage of Alzheimer's disease. Performance evaluation includes key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC (Area Under the Curve). AUC can be calculated in two ways: individual AUC scores for each disease stage or a combined AUC for overall classification. This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between different stages of Alzheimer's. The results can be integrated into clinical workflows to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease progression, offering a potential path toward more efficient and early intervention strategies.","","979-8-3315-2392-3","10.1109/ICSADL65848.2025.10933350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10933350","Alzheimer Disease;Disease Progression;Deep Learning;3D CNN;Multi-Class Classification;Hybrid Models;GRU Layers","Deep learning;Support vector machines;Solid modeling;Analytical models;Three-dimensional displays;Accuracy;Attention mechanisms;Brain modeling;Data models;Alzheimer's disease","","1","","21","IEEE","27 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the presence of numerous redundant features and corrupted neuroimages within multimodal datasets poses significant challenges for existing methods. In this paper, we propose a feature selection method named Enhanced Multimodal Low-rank Embedding (EMLE) for multimodal AD diagnosis. Unlike previous methods utilizing convex relaxations of the  $\ell _{{2},{0}}$ -norm, EMLE exploits an  $\ell _{{2},\gamma }$ -norm regularized projection matrix to obtain an embedding representation and select informative features jointly for each modality. The  $\ell _{{2},\gamma }$ -norm, employing an upper-bounded nonconvex Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP) function to characterize sparsity, offers a superior approximation for the  $\ell _{{2},{0}}$ -norm compared to other convex relaxations. Next, a similarity graph is learned based on the self-expressiveness property to increase the robustness to corrupted data. As the approximation coefficient vectors of samples from the same class should be highly correlated, an MCP function introduced norm, i.e., matrix  $\gamma $ -norm, is applied to constrain the rank of the graph. Furthermore, recognizing that diverse modalities should share an underlying structure related to AD, we establish a consensus graph for all modalities to unveil intrinsic structures across multiple modalities. Finally, we fuse the embedding representations of all modalities into the label space to incorporate supervisory information. The results of extensive experiments on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative datasets verify the discriminability of the features selected by EMLE.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2024.3464861","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62402092,62202084,82374559); Chengdu Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2024-YF05-02540-SN); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2024T170105,2021M690028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10684737","Alzheimer’s disease;feature selection;multimodal neuroimaging;low-rank embedding","Neuroimaging;Vectors;Feature extraction;Alzheimer's disease;Upper bound;Robustness;Sparse matrices","Alzheimer Disease;Humans;Multimodal Imaging;Algorithms;Neuroimaging;Brain;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Databases, Factual","2","","46","IEEE","20 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A professional neurologist needs to examine medical imaging techniques including PET scans, CT scans, and MRIs for diagnosing an Alzheimer's patient. This procedure is time- and resource-intensive. Many people hesitate to treat Alzheimer's disease because of this instability. The potential for early detection of Alzheimer's disease might be achieved by the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, the MRI dataset has an issue in class imbalance problem. To address the problems in the dataset, a data balancing technique called SMOTETomek is used and then a lightweight CNN model is developed that uses MRI images as input and determines a patient's stage. In terms of recall, precision, accuracy, ROC curve, and f1 score, the performance of the CNN model has been compared with a few transfer learning algorithms. Therefore, using the proposed model, each Alzheimer's patient may determine what stage of the disease they are now in and take further actions to lower the mortality rate of Alzheimer's patients.

The effect of using comorbidity features in machine learning models to predict the time until a patient develops a prodrome was observed. In this study, we used Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) high-dimensional clinical data to compare the performance of six machine learning algorithms for survival analysis, combined with six feature selection methods trained on two settings: with and without comorbidities features. Our ridge model combined with permutation feature selection achieves maximum performance of 0.90 when using comorbidity features with the concordance index as a performance indicator.

Most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multimodal data and train the model using all samples once, which do not fully explore the structural information across the different modalities and ignore the significance of sample learning in the training process. In this article, we propose a multimodal self-paced locality-preserving learning (MSLPL) framework to preserve the inherent structural relationships of the original data and realize the sample selection process from “simple” to “complex.” Specifically, the model can project the neuroimaging and genetic data into the label space and learn dimensionality reduction manners with preserving locality structure. Meanwhile, the contributions of each sample are adaptively evaluated by weighting optimization so that the impact of noises can be reduced during model training by self-paced learning (SPL). Finally, a multikernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different modalities for the final prediction. We evaluate MSLPL on 913 subjects from the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database with imaging and genetic data.

The study focuses on the use of DCNNs for AD identification. Our dataset is collected from the Kaggle website and preprocessed such that the inputs are identical for every model. Several criteria are used to assess the DCNN architecture’s performance, including recall, accuracy, precision, and f1-score. By looking at individual architecture’s predictive capabilities, we may discover further the benefits and drawbacks of AD detection jobs.

However, the existing TCCA models fail to adequately address the heterogeneity present in real-world tensor data, such as brain imaging data collected from diverse groups characterized by factors like sex and race. Consequently, these models may yield biased outcomes. In order to surmount this constraint, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Group TCCA (MG-TCCA), which enables the joint analysis of multiple subgroups. By incorporating a dual sparsity structure and a block coordinate ascent algorithm, our MG-TCCA method effectively addresses heterogeneity and leverages information across different groups to identify consistent signals. This novel approach facilitates the quantification of shared and individual structures, reduces data dimensionality, and enables visual exploration. To empirically validate our approach, we conduct a study focused on investigating correlations between two brain positron emission tomography (PET) modalities (AV-45 and FDG) within an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort. Our results demonstrate that MG-TCCA surpasses traditional TCCA and Sparse TCCA (STCCA) in identifying sex-specific cross-modality imaging correlations.

However, most existing multi-template based methods simply average or concatenate multiple sets of features extracted from different templates, which potentially ignores important structural information contained in the multi-template data. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel relationship induced multi-template learning method for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI), by explicitly modeling structural information in the multi-template data. Specifically, we first nonlinearly register each brain's magnetic resonance (MR) image separately onto multiple pre-selected templates, and then extract multiple sets of features for this MR image. Next, we develop a novel feature selection algorithm by introducing two regularization terms to model the relationships among templates and among individual subjects. Using these selected features corresponding to multiple templates, we then construct multiple support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Finally, an ensemble classification is used to combine outputs of all SVM classifiers, for achieving the final result. We evaluate our proposed method on 459 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including 97 AD patients, 128 normal controls (NC), 117 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients, and 117 stable MCI (sMCI) patients.

On the other hand, traditional diagnostic approaches frequently depend on expensive imaging methods and arbitrary clinical judgments, which causes delays in diagnosis and less than ideal results. By utilizing MRI scans and handwriting samples, the suggested strategy embraces the ability of multi-modal data integration to offer a novel perspective to AD prediction. A non-invasive and economical method of identifying minor motor and cognitive problems suggestive of early-stage $A D$ is handwriting analysis, whereas MRI offers important insights into the structural brain abnormalities linked to AD. To rigorously pre-process and extract significant features from MRI and handwriting data, state-of-the-art deep learning techniques are used. A multimodal neural network architecture is then fed these features for combined analysis and prediction. Accuracy rates of $\mathbf{8 8 \%}$ for handwriting data and $\mathbf{9 0} \%$ for MRI images are attained by each independently trained model. A unified classifier is then used to aggregate the outputs of different models and refine the categorization through the addition of denser layers A remarkable $\mathbf{9 7 \%}$ accuracy on the test set is achieved by this combined model, which considerably improves diagnostic accuracy.

Precise and timely identification of this condition is significant for proper treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely employed technology for analyzing brain structures and identifying abnormalities interconnected with AD. The recent advancements in medical fields, including the introduction of Deep Learning (DL) approaches, have automated the AD diagnosis process. However, achieving high accuracy remains a challenge due to the complexity and heterogeneity of AD manifestations. In this proposed work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning architecture designed to improve the accuracy of AD classification.

However, most of the existing CNN-based methods often disregard the local features of the brain data, which leads to a loss of subtle fine-grained features in the brain imaging data. Moreover, the existing CNN architectures, which mainly rely on global features, do not pay much attention to the discriminability of the extracted features for the task of classification of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the existing architectures often end up using a large number of parameters to enhance the richness of the extracted features. This paper proposes a novel lightweight deep CNN, which extracts local and global contextual features from the sagittal slices of structural MRI data and uses both of these two types of features for the classification of the disease. The main idea used in designing the proposed network is to process separately the local and global features by using modules that pay a special attention to extract local and global contextual features. The fused local and global contextual features are then used for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. The proposed network is tested for the binary and multiclass classifications of the disease using the MR images taken from the ADNI database. The proposed network is shown to provide a performance that is significantly higher than that provided by other existing state-of-the-art networks, yet using a number of parameters that is a small fraction of that used by the other schemes.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3512417","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; Regroupement Stratégique en Microsystèmes du Québec; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); Department of Defense(grant numbers:W81XWH-12-2-0012); National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; AbbVie, Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; CereSpir, Inc.; Eisai Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; EuroImmun; Genentech, Inc.; Fujirebio; GE Healthcare; IXICO Ltd.; Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC.; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC.; Lundbeck; Merck & Co., Inc.; Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC.; NeuroRx Research; Neurotrack Technologies; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Pfizer Inc.; Piramal Imaging; Servier; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company; Transition Therapeutics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10783052","Alzheimer's disease classification;contextual attention;convolutional neural network;local and global features;lightweight deep model;magnetic resonance imaging","Feature extraction;Alzheimer's disease;Magnetic resonance imaging;Convolutional neural networks;Three-dimensional displays;Bioinformatics;Proposals;Neuroimaging;Hippocampus;Convolution","Alzheimer Disease;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks, Computer;Brain;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Neuroimaging;Deep Learning;Databases, Factual;Convolutional Neural Networks","1","","31","IEEE","9 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical, as the brain is the primary organ affected, and early intervention can help slow disease progression. Traditionally, AD diagnosis relies heavily on MRI scans, a process that is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present promising solutions for more efficient detection. This study examines the application of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for detecting AD in MRI images. A comprehensive comparison was performed on four distinct CNN architectures—Inception-V3, ResNet-152, VGG16, and VGG19—using MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The images were categorized into four classes: Non-Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented.While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at identifying advanced dementia stages (Stages 5-7), accurately classifying the earliest, most elusive stages (Stages 2-4) remains a significant challenge. This paper tackles this crucial gap by systematically comparing various CNN models to achieve promising classification accuracy for these crucial early stages of dementia. Through rigorous analysis, we aim to advance the field of dementia detection by enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Therefore, the application of machine learning technology can assist healthcare professionals in enhancing their efforts to combat Alzheimer's, a serious medical condition.","2831-5022","979-8-3315-2782-2","10.1109/PuneCon63413.2024.10895066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10895066","CNN;Alzheimer’s disease detection;computer vision;Cohen's kappa statistic","Neuroimaging;Measurement;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease;Monitoring;Medical diagnostic imaging","","1","","16","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many researchers study the transmission mode of brain atrophy through brain networks.

Then, the AAL template is used to divide the t map into brain regions. The correlation between node atrophy and neighbor atrophy is used as the verification indicator.Results: It is found that the node atrophy of AD is significantly related to their neighbor atrophy. As a control, when the random matrix is used as the brain network connection, there is no significant correlation between the node atrophy of AD and their neighbor atrophy.Conclusion: This study found that brain atrophy in AD patients was significantly related to its network connection, indicating that the propagation of brain atrophy in AD can be explained by network connection.","","978-1-6654-9699-5","10.1109/CME55444.2022.10063252","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shanxi Scholarship Council of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063252","AD;connection;atrophy;VBM","Atrophy;Pathology;Nerve fibers;Correlation;Grey matter;Alzheimer's disease","","","","14","IEEE","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate prediction of the disease progression has received increasing attention. Cognitive scores that reflect patients' cognitive status have become important criteria for predicting AD. Most existing methods consider the relationship between neuroimages and cognitive scores to improve prediction results. However, the inherent structure information in interrelated cognitive scores is rarely considered. Method: In this article, we propose a relation-aware tensor completion multitask learning method (RATC-MTL), in which the cognitive scores are represented as a third-order tensor to preserve the global structure information in clinical scores. We combine both tensor completion and linear regression into a unified framework, which allows us to capture both inter and intra modes correlations in cognitive tensor with a low-rank constraint, as well as incorporate the relationship between biological features and cognitive status by imposing a regression model on multiple cognitive scores. Result: Compared to the single-task and state-of-the-art multi-task algorithms, our proposed method obtains the best results for predicting cognitive scores in terms of four commonly used metrics. Furthermore, the overall performance of our method in classifying AD progress is also the best. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in fully exploring the global structure information in cognitive scores. Significance: This study introduces a novel concept of leveraging tensor completion to assist in disease diagnoses, potentially offering a solution to the issue of data scarcity encountered in prolonged monitoring scenarios.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2024.3365131","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2023YFC3806003); Medico-Engineering Cooperation Funds from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:ZYGX2021YGLH215); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171088,62020106011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10433678","Alzheimer's disease;multitask learning;regression model;tensor completion","Tensors;Correlation;Biomarkers;Diffusion tensor imaging;Indexes;Biological system modeling;Alzheimer's disease;Multitasking;Regression analysis","Alzheimer Disease;Humans;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;Algorithms;Male;Aged;Female;Brain;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Aged, 80 and over;Machine Learning","3","","63","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ensuring that health systems are prepared to deal with this phenomenal rate of aging and associated diseases generates many challenges. Among these challenges is facing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may occur at some point in the elderly life and may harm societies. AD is considered a neurological, psychological, mental, and health setback. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can improve patient care and support many medical functions, such as diagnosing diseases that can reduce preventable harm. This research's main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Ontology (ADDO). It is a comprehensive semantic knowledge base toward the development of fuzzy ontology-based CDSS for AD diagnosis. ADDO can serve as a core component of CDSS, which provides representation, annotation, and access to aspects related to AD's study and diagnosis. Toward the management of this objective, ADDO is based on the essentials of the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) and follows the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for General Medical Sciences (OGMS) principles. ADDO focuses on representing the patient characteristics, complications, drugs, diagnosis examination tests, and key aspects of their periodic visits in a standard way. The possibility of semantic interoperability is taken into account by integrating ADDO and a heterogeneous AD dataset. We used ADNI as a case study to mapping a set of real instances. To manage the medical domain's uncertainty, ADDO is extended to fuzzy ontology to accommodate the medical linguistic variables and enhance diagnosis results' efficiency. ADDO is constructed using Protégé 5.5.0 software and evaluated using the HermiT reasoner and SPARQL semantic queries. ADDO currently includes 7060 concepts, 99 properties, 46274 axioms, and 30708 annotations. As a result, ADDO is consistent and more reliable in managing most AD aspects than other existing AD ontologies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311736","Fuzzy ontology;clinical decision support system;Alzheimer’s disease;knowledge based;Mild COGNITIVE impairment;ontology representation","Ontologies;Diseases;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semantics;Medical services;Alzheimer's disease;Computers","","20","","56","CCBY","31 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the first step, the average CBFs in ten cortical regions were determined as functional image features based on the CBF map image, which was non-linearly registered to a Talairach brain atlas. In the next step, a support vector machine was trained by the average CBFs in ten cortical functional regions, and was employed for distinguishing patients with AD from control subjects.

The economic cost of treating for AD patients is expected to increase. Therefore in the last few years, research on AD diagnostic has laid great emphasis on computer-aided methods. The significance of developing an artificial intelligent diagnostic technique towards accurate and early AD classification seems essential. Deep-learning models hold significant benefits over machine learning approaches as these techniques do not require any kind of feature engineering. Moreover, T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the neuroimaging data modality which is widely practiced for such a purpose. In some cases, the most significant barrier to integrating DL models into pre-existing applications is a lack of adequate data architecture. Changing medical information is usually hard to communicate, examine, and interpret. Transfer learning (TL) allows designers to use a combination of models in order to fine-tune a specified solution to a target problem. Transferring knowledge across two separate models could lead a generally a more reliable and precise model. In this work, researchers utilized an EfficientNet TL model already trained on ImageNet dataset to categorise subjects as AD vs. Cognitive Normal (CN) based on MRI scans of the brain. The dataset for this study was acquired from Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The performance parameters such as accuracy, AUC were used to evaluate the model. The proposed model on ADNI dataset achieved an accuracy level of 91.36% and AUC as 83% in comparison to other existing transfer learning models.","","978-1-6654-0073-2","10.1109/ESCI53509.2022.9758195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758195","Alzheimer's disease;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Classification;Transfer Learning;EfficientNet","Neuroimaging;Biological system modeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Brain modeling;Reliability","","12","","12","IEEE","22 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, by introducing a novel multidirectional mapping mechanism into the model, the proposed MP-GAN can capture the salient global features efficiently. Thus, using the class discriminative map from the generator, the proposed model can clearly delineate the subtle lesions via MR image transformations between the source domain and the predefined target domain. Besides, by integrating the adversarial loss, classification loss, cycle consistency loss, and  ${L}1$  penalty, a single generator in MP-GAN can learn the class discriminative maps for multiple classes.

However, accurately classifying MRI scans based on neurodegenerative diseases faces challenges due to significant variability across classes and limited intra-class differences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach aimed at improving the early detection of AD through MRI imaging. This method integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Cascade Attention Model (CAM-CNN). The CAM-CNN model outperforms traditional CNNs in AD classification accuracy and processing complexity. In this architecture, the attention mechanism is effectively implemented by utilizing two constraint cost functions and a cross-network with diverse pre-trained parameters for a two-stream architecture. Additionally, two new cost functions, Satisfied Rank Loss (SRL) and Cross-Network Similarity Loss (CNSL), are introduced to enhance collaboration and overall network performance. Finally, a unique entropy addition method is employed in the attention module for network integration, converting intermediate outcomes into the final prediction. These components are designed to work collaboratively and can be sequentially trained for optimal performance, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of AD stage classification and robustness to interference from MR images. Validation using the Kaggle dataset demonstrates the model's accuracy of 99.07% in multiclass classification, ensuring precise classification and early detection of all AD subtypes. Further validation across three feature categories with varying numbers confirms the robustness of the proposed approach, with deviations from the standard criteria of less than 1%. Applied in Alzheimer's patient care, this capability holds promise for enhancing value-based therapy and clinical decision-making.

Based on the findings, multi-modal data contributes significantly to the identification of Alzheimer's disease prediction with high accuracy and less variability so that fruitful intervention trials and research would be well pioneered strategies.","","979-8-3315-4362-4","10.1109/ICSES63760.2024.10910359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10910359","Artificial Intelligence;Alzheimer's;AI;multi-source data;CNN;LSTM;neuroimaging;Electronic Health Records;Genome;early targeted Treatment","Proteins;Neuroimaging;Soft sensors;Standards organizations;Genomics;Alzheimer's disease;Artificial intelligence;Bioinformatics;Long short term memory;Blood flow","","","","17","IEEE","12 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Before a Cognitively normal (CN) person develops symptoms of AD, he may pass through an intermediate stage, commonly known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is having two stages, namely StableMCI (SMCI) and Progressive MCI (PMCI). In SMCI, a patient remains stable, whereas, in the case of PMCI, a person gradually develops few symptoms of AD. Several research works are in progress on the detection and classification of AD based on changes in the brain. In this paper, we have analyzed few existing state-of-art works for AD detection and classification, based on different feature extraction approaches.

The relevance of Alzheimer's disease is becoming more and more clear in both the medical and social settings as the world's population continues to age. Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by the buildup of aberrant protein aggregates in the brain, causes a series of deteriorating alterations that impair cognitive performance. This study investigates the crucial area of Alzheimer's disease prediction, highlighting the value of early detection, better patient treatment, and the revolutionary use of machine learning algorithms. Our goal in this research project is to investigate the use of several machine learning models for the early identification of Alzheimer's disease. An Alzheimer's disease dataset obtained from the Kaggle repository is used, along with four different ML models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-NN, and XG Boost. For the purpose of building and assessing these models, this dataset is divided into training and testing subsets. The results obtained from the ML models are then evaluated using a variety of validity scores, such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, each of which has a specific function in computing model performance.

Gene expression data is a mature technology. It has many advantages such as high throughput, less-invasiveness, and affordability. It has great potential to help people diagnose Alzheimer’s disease in early stage. However, because the amount of information is too large compared to the number of samples in the Alzheimer’s database, researchers are facing “curse of dimensionality” when using gene expression data. In this work we are interested in the task of dimensionality reduction of gene expression data in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We investigated six dimensionality reduction algorithms: Principal component analysis, Kernel principal component analysis, Isometric feature mapping, Local linear embedding, Stacked denoising autoencoder, and Stacked sparse autoencoder. An SVM classifier is used to classify the samples in the ADNI dataset using the features obtained by dimensionality reduction. We first optimized the appropriate number of hidden layers for the two stacked autoencoders. Then we performed different degrees of dimensionality reduction with the other four algorithms and compared the classification performance of the features obtained by different algorithms with the SVM classifier. Our experimental results show that the features obtained by kernel principal component analysis and local linear embedding, Stacked denoising autoencoder, and Stacked sparse autoencoder dimensionality reduction have good AD classification performance.","","978-1-6654-0668-0","10.1109/MSN53354.2021.00106","National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; AbbVie; BioClinica; Biogen; Eisai; Elan; Genentech; IXICO; Merck; Meso Scale Diagnostics; Nova; Servier; National Institutes of Health; Northern California Institute for Research and Education; University of Southern California; University of Southern California; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751471","Gene Expression;Dimensionality Reduction;Alzheimer’s Disease","Dimensionality reduction;Support vector machines;Noise reduction;Classification algorithms;Gene expression;Alzheimer's disease;Task analysis","","2","","22","IEEE","13 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The clustering analysis identified eight distinct CAPs, which are classified into three categories: primary sensory network (PSN) dominant, high-order cognitive network (HOCN) dominant, and PSN-HOCN co-dominant. We further analyzed CAP transition matrices and CAP occurrence rates across different disease groups. Results revealed that during the transition from NC to MCI, CAP transitions were primarily unidirectional and confined to the same CAP category, with increased dynamic activity of HOCN-dominant CAPs. In contrast, the transition from MCI to AD involved bidirectional CAP transitions with frequent inter-network transitions, while the AD stage exhibited complex interactions across multiple networks. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic brain network changes during AD progression, potentially paving the way for future non-invasive brain stimulation therapies based on brain functional dynamics.","","979-8-3315-0739-8","10.1109/CISP-BMEI64163.2024.10906206","Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20A20191,62336002,82071912,62406025); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2023TQ0027,2024M754099); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:IS23114); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10906206","co-activation pattern;individual brain network parcellation;mild cognitive impairment;resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging;transitions","Neuroimaging;Visualization;Magnetic resonance;Focusing;Signal processing;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Brain stimulation;Alzheimer's disease;Informatics;Biomedical engineering","","","","37","IEEE","7 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We rank the significant spatiotemporal windows for each subject and show that the features of the top-ranked windows provide significant separability between the AD and healthy subjects. We determine the most significant electrode and show that taking only the top two electrodes provides a better classification of the AD patients compared with taking all the electrodes or a random pair.

The combination of eye-tracking and speech analysis offers a promising diagnostic solution by providing a non-invasive method to examine differences between healthy controls and individuals with MCI, who may progress to develop AD. In this study, we analyzed a multimodal clinical eye-tracking and speech dataset collected from 78 participants (37 controls, 20 MCI, and 21 AD) during the King-Devick test and a reading task to classify and diagnose MCI/AD versus healthy controls. To that end, we developed a Fusion Neural Network, a deep learning-based classification model that integrates gaze and speech-derived features, including pupil size variations, fixation duration, saccadic movements, and speech delay, to improve MCI diagnosis performance. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 79.2% for MCI diagnosis and 82% for AD.

This is because it harms the brain cells related to memory and thinking abilities, and it's hard to tell apart from normal brain patterns in scans. Detecting it needs a special way to represent features for sorting it out. Deep learning methods can acquire such representations from the MRI data. In this paper, five different transfer learning models are trained in 15 binary classifiers, each of them can classify two of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN) classes. This method finds the best transfer learning model for classifying each binary comparison. The proposed technique results in best accuracy of 92% for the AD vs. CN classifier, 94% for the AD vs. MCI classifier, and 72% for the MCI vs. CN classifier, which shows the effectiveness of transfer learning in distinguishing the AD vs. CN and the AD vs. MCI cases.","2643-279X","979-8-3503-3015-1","10.1109/ICCKE60553.2023.10326311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10326311","Alzheimer's disease;Deep learning;MRI;Transfer learning","Deep learning;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Pipelines","","3","","15","IEEE","27 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early and accurate diagnosis plays a crucial role in delaying disease progression. Structural MRI imaging is a widely used modality for AD diagnosis due to its non-invasive and high-resolution properties. Although visual backbone architectures such as Visual Transformer and State Space Model (SSM) perform well in image classification tasks, current models still have shortcomings in local feature extraction. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Res-VMamba model, which is an enhanced SSM architecture that integrates a residual convolutional patch embedding module inspired by the ResNet stem. This module improves local feature extraction by combining multi-scale convolutions, residual connections, and dual max pooling operations. The research evaluates this model on a multiclass MRI-based AD dataset containing three categories: 'Non Demented', 'Very Mild Demented', and 'Mild Demented'. Experimental results demonstrate that Res-VMamba outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs, Transformers, and the original VMamba model in classification accuracy (86.90 %) and F1-score (86.76), confirming the effectiveness of the proposed patch embedding design for fine-grained AD staging tasks. The study provides a more refined pathological identification tool for the diagnosis of $A D$ and has important practical application value.","","979-8-3315-7423-9","10.1109/ICAITA67588.2025.11137840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11137840","Alzheimer's disease;MRI classification;deep learning;Res-VMamba;patch embedding","Deep learning;Visualization;Accuracy;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Transformers;Data models;Alzheimer's disease","","","","26","IEEE","8 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To meet the requirement for early identification, researchers have explored various machine-learning techniques. To enhance the accuracy of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease, researchers have employed supervised and unsupervised learning approaches derived from machine learning. While supervised learning relies on labelled data, obtaining sufficient labelled samples can be time-consuming and requires specialized assistance. The focus is on multiclass classification, harnessing MRI and PET data. SGLDM and SIFT feature extraction algorithms are utilized to enable the fusion of features from diverse perspectives, resulting in a robust classification model. This research introduces a novel strategy for AD diagnosis, combining multimodal feature fusion with a fuzziness-based-semi-supervised learning method.

The primary damage occurs in white matter (WM) tracts leading to disintegration and death of neurons. Diffusion tensor imaging is one of the most widely used techniques to study the microstructural changes in WM. In this work, variations in length of WM tracts for regions associated with emotional regulation are studied. The images obtained from ADNI database are pre-processed to remove non-brain tissues and non-rigid registration is performed. Deterministic streamline tractography is used to reconstruct the WM tracts for whole brain. Length of each tract is estimated by voxel counting method. Brodmann area maps are superimposed to extract the tracts for areas 11, 38 and 47. Average tract length of each subregion is compared for AD and normal controls. The results show that there is a reduction in average tract length for AD subjects in the three regions studied. Maximum reduction of 27.15% is observed for area 11 followed by 24.43% for area 38 and 16.31% for area 47. No correlation is observed with MMSE score for any of these three sub-regions.

It causes a decline in cognitive abilities. Effective automated procedures are required for early prediction and diagnosis since it is imperative to stop the progression of the disease. The creation of precise computer diagnostic systems was made possible by the nature of several aspects of neural data, which were primarily retrieved from neuroimaging with computer‐aided algorithms. In the field of computer vision, deep learning, a high‐tech machine learning strategy, has demonstrated exceptional ability in identifying detailed structures in complicated, high‐dimensional data. Presently, a rising body of research suggests that deep learning techniques can act as a crucial pillar for the diagnosis, categorization, and prediction of AD. In order to develop targeted therapies, it is crucial to comprehend the genetic aetiology of AD. Several researchers had tried to find possible biomarkers for future therapy by using machine learning techniques to analyze the expressed genes in AD patients. Technology advancements in genomic research, like genome‐wide association studies (GWAS), which enable the identification of polymorphisms and have been extensively used in investigations of AD, have identified certain genes as significant clinical risk factors for AD. In addition, a number of deep learning models are currently being used in research investigations to distinguish AD from normal controls and/or to distinguish AD from mild cognitive impairment in light of the most recent developments in neuroimaging and genetics. The chapter enlightens many studies that apply deep learning algorithms to predict AD using genomes or neuroimaging data along with the supportive tactics. On the basis of combining both neuroimaging and genome data, pertinent integrative neuroimaging genomics studies that make use of deep learning techniques to forecast AD have been discussed. The limitations of the most recent deep learning combined with neuroimaging and genomics AD investigations have also been described. Lastly, a summary of the research findings, challenges, and future directions for integrating deep learning methods into therapeutic settings is deliberated.</p>","","9781394234189","10.1002/9781394234196.ch14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10952872.pdf&bkn=10950227&pdfType=chapter","","Genomics;Diseases;Deep learning;Bioinformatics;Neuroimaging;Alzheimer's disease;Genetics;Proteins;Machine learning;Stress","","","","","","8 Apr 2025","","","Wiley","Wiley AI eBook Chapters"

Recently, several studies have revealed that there is a strong connection between several retinal and choroidal pathologies, such as Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), which leads to AD. This research mainly focused on detecting AD from CNV via optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. OCT is used primarily to diagnose retinal diseases, as it provides high-resolution images of retinal layers and highlights the abnormalities present in the retinal images, which leads to CNV. Linking the CNV with retinal features of Alzheimer's requires unique techniques and analysis, as these two brains and eyes are interconnected by sharing the vascular and neural systems. In this work, the pre-trained model ResNET-101 with transfer learning is used to find the abnormal patterns belonging to AD using OCT images. The proposed Multi-Learning Fusion Model (MLFM) combines residual layers with Xtensible Convolutional Neural Networks (X-CNNs), which detect abnormalities from OCT images. In this context, the training model's residual layers transform the features of vascular and neural systems. Furthermore, the MLFM exhibits high sensitivity in detecting subtle choroidal changes associated with AD progression. Finally, the quantitative results show that the proposed MLFM obtains an accuracy of 99.78% with accurate abnormal region detection.","","979-8-3315-1809-7","10.1109/ICICNIS64247.2024.10823111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10823111","Alzheimer's disease (AD);Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV);Coherence Tomography (OCT);Multi-Learning Fusion Model (MLFM);ResNET-101;Transfer Learning","Pathology;Wiener filters;Accuracy;Noise;Transfer learning;Transforms;Retina;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease","","","","21","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clinically, the diagnosis of AD is mainly based on rating scales and neuroimaging technology which is invasive, costly and time-consuming. Other than that, the clinical pathology has become irreversible when neuroimaging characteristics appear. It is imperative to develop new noninvasive methods for early diagnosis of AD. Several studies indicated the probable association of cognitive decline with gait changes might shed light on potential features for distinction of AD. This paper aims to exploit the feasibility of gait features for early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment(MCI) and AD by using machine learning methods. A device-free AD detection system is built, with a natural undisturbed gait collecting system and a well-performed Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) based model, in this article. Moreover, it can serve as a simplified, non-invasive, and highly accurate clinical auxiliary tool for early diagnosis and distinction of AD. Experimental results showed a 90.48%, 92.00%, and 88.24% in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity respectively for distinguishing AD by using the method with LSTM based model. Furthermore, the gait cycle and stride length in MCI or AD were more variable than in healthy controls through redefining and calculating the gait features with skeleton data obtained by Kinect devices.","","978-1-7281-6267-6","10.1109/HEALTHCOM49281.2021.9398984","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632014,61627808,61210010); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2014CB744600); Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission(grant numbers:Z171100000117005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9398984","Gait Analysis;Alzheimer's Disease;Long Short-Term Memory;Skeleton Analysis","Neuroimaging;Sensitivity and specificity;Tools;Feature extraction;Skeleton;Sensors;Alzheimer's disease","","7","","19","IEEE","14 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, prospectively acquiring MCI subtype data is time-consuming and resource-intensive; the resultant small datasets could lead to severe overfitting and difficulty in extracting discriminative information. Inspired by that various longitudinal biomarkers and cognitive measurements present an ordinal pathway on AD progression, we propose a novel Hybrid-granularity Ordinal PrototypE learning (HOPE) method to characterize AD ordinal progression for MCI progression prediction. First, HOPE learns an ordinal metric space that enables progression prediction by prototype comparison. Second, HOPE leverages a novel hybrid-granularity ordinal loss to learn the ordinal nature of AD via effectively integrating instance-to-instance ordinality, instance-to-class compactness, and class-to-class separation. Third, to make the prototype learning more stable, HOPE employs an exponential moving average strategy to learn the global prototypes of NC and AD dynamically. Experimental results on the internal ADNI and the external NACC datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HOPE over existing state-of-the-art methods as well as its interpretability.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3357453","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:21ZR1403600); Key Projects of “Double First-Class” Initiative of Fudan University(grant numbers:XM03231648); Shanghai Municipal of Science and Technology(grant numbers:20JC1419500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62306075,62176059); Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major(grant numbers:2018SHZDZX01); ZJLab; Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University; Shanghai Center for Brain Science and Brain-inspired Technology; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); DOD ADNI; Department of Defense(grant numbers:W81XWH-12-2-0012); National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; NIA/NIH(grant numbers:U24 AG072122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10412338","Alzheimer's disease;mild cognitive impairment;progression prediction;ordinal learning","Prototypes;Alzheimer's disease;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biomarkers;Bioinformatics;Estimation;Data mining","Humans;Cognitive Dysfunction;Disease Progression;Alzheimer Disease;Aged;Machine Learning;Algorithms;Male;Aged, 80 and over;Female","5","","74","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study explores the development and application of an innovative diagnostic tool, the Smart handwriting tool, designed to detect early signs of cognitive decline through detailed handwriting analysis. Equipped with an MPU-9250 sensor, the Smart handwriting tool records the three-dimensional coordinates, velocity, and acceleration of handwriting movements. These parameters are crucial for assessing spatial control, motion consistency, speed variations, and the ability to modulate movement speed and force — all of which are often impaired in cognitive disorders such as AD.The study involved 20 patients diagnosed with AD (Alzheimer’s group, AG) and 18 healthy individuals forming the control group (CG), matched by age and education. Data collection included tasks such as sentence rewriting, figure redrawing, and number rewriting. The data were processed using the CoolTerm software with an 18 Hz sampling rate. Descriptive statistics showed lower average gyroscope and accelerometer values in the AD group, indicating slower and less variable movements compared to the control group. T-tests confirmed statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) across all measured parameters between the AD and control groups.The findings support the potential of the Smart handwriting tool as a non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic tool for the early detection of AD. By capturing subtle neuromotor changes, the Smart handwriting tool can facilitate early diagnosis and timely intervention, potentially altering the course of the disease and improving patient outcomes.

This research presents a comprehensive approach to the classification of Alzheimer's disease using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, focusing on four distinct classes: nondemented, mild, very mild, and moderate demented. Our main goals are to combine diverse datasets to improve the robustness and adaptability of the model and to fully investigate Alzheimer's disease in all four stages. To achieve these goals, we employed a combination of machine learning and deep learning models. The models utilized include Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gabor filters with SVM, Gabor-Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) with SVM, ResNet50, AlexNet, and InceptionV3. Among these, the InceptionV3 model achieved the highest accuracy of 96.20% using 5-fold crossvalidation followed the Resnet50 model achieving accuracy of 95.43%. Our approach addresses key challenges such as class imbalance, high intra-class variation, inter-class similarities, and dataset variability, demonstrating significant potential in improving Alzheimer's disease classification and detection.","2473-7569","979-8-3315-1050-3","10.1109/FIT63703.2024.10838463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10838463","Alzheimer's Disease;MRI Scans;Machine Learning;Deep Learning;Cross Validation;InceptionV3;Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Support vector machines;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Accuracy;Magnetic resonance imaging;Focusing;Vectors;Robustness;Alzheimer's disease;Residual neural networks","","","","24","IEEE","17 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Psychophysiological and cognitive tests as well as other functional studies can detect pre-symptomatic stages of dementia. When assembled with structural data, cognitive tests diagnose NDs more reliably thus becoming a multimodal diagnostic tool. Objective. Our main goal is to improve screening for dementia by studying an association between the brain structure and its function. Hypothetically, the brain structure-function association has features specific for either disease-related cognitive deterioration or normal neurocognitive slowing while aging. Materials and methods. We studied a total number of 287 cognitively normal cases, 646 of mild cognitive impairment, and 369 of Alzheimer’s disease. To work out a new marker of neurodegeneration, we created a convolutional neural network-based regression model and predicted the cognitive status of the cognitively preserved examinee from the brain MRI data. This was a model of normal aging. A big deviation from the model suggests a high risk of accelerated cognitive decline. Results. The deviation from the model of normal aging can accurately distinguish cognitively normal subjects from MCI patients (AUC = 0.9957). We also achieved creditable performance in the MCI-versus-AD classification (AUC = 0.9793). We identified a considerable difference in the MMSE test between A-positive and A-negative demented individuals according to ATN-criteria (6.27±1.82 vs 5.32±1.9;  $p< 0.05$ ). Conclusion. The deviation from the model of normal aging can be potentially used as a marker of dementia and as a tool for differentiating Alzheimer’s disease from non-Alzheimer’s dementia.

Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has been widely used to study the white matter tracts in the human brain and for the estimation of structural connectivity parameters through the progression of the disease. Previous studies using fMRI focus on functional decline and adding on to this, DTI helps in analyzing the topological and structural integrity. Histopathological studies of the disease have revealed that major cortical neuronal loss occurred in Corpus Callosum and Cingulate Gyrus regions of the brain. In this work, DTI images of four AD patients for three progressive years have been obtained and the structural connectivity parameters namely: Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Axial Diffusivity, Radial Diffusivity and Mean Diffusivity have been estimated at the onset of the disease and for the three progressive years. Results show that the FA values decreased in the progressive years for all patients whereas the diffusivity parameters increased every year showing abnormalities in the connectivity parameters.","","978-1-5090-4740-6","10.1109/ICSCN.2017.8085686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8085686","Alzheimer's disease;Diffusion Tensor Imaging;Structural Connectivity;Deterministic Tractography;White Matter tract","Dementia;Diffusion tensor imaging;Optical fiber networks","","2","","18","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
