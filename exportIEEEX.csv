The status of Parkinson's disease is traditionally classified through ordinal scale strategies, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. However, the application of the ordinal scale strategy inherently requires highly specialized and limited medical resources for interpretation. An alternative strategy involves the implementation of an iPhone application that enables the device to serve as a functional wireless accelerometer system. The Parkinson's disease tremor attributes may be recorded in either an effectively autonomous public or private setting, for which the resultant accelerometer signal of the tremor can be conveyed wireless and through email to a remote location for data post-processing. The initial testing and evaluation of the iPhone wireless accelerometer application for quantifying Parkinson's disease tremor successfully demonstrates the capacity to acquire tremor characteristics in an effectively autonomous environment, while potentially alleviating strain on limited and highly specialized medical resources.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5627240","Parkinson's disease;iPhone application;iPhone;wireless accelerometer;Parkinson's disease tremor quantification","Parkinson's disease;Accelerometers;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Acceleration;Brain stimulation","Acceleration;Cellular Phone;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Software;Telemedicine;Telemedicine;Telemetry;Telemetry;Transducers;Tremor;Tremor","92","3","19","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The incidence of Parkinson's disease is proportional to age. The status of Parkinson's disease is characterized through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is an ordinal scale, for which the scale is qualitatively evaluated. The inherent issue of the ordinal scale is the lack of a temporal parameter to evaluate the attributes of the movement disorder. The evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale requires clinical specialization, occurring in a clinical environment. Accelerometers, through the advent of miniaturization, have reached a capacity to advance the evaluation of Parkinson's disease. Tremor characteristics and temporal attributes of Parkinson's disease can be readily quantified. Accelerometer systems have been tested and evaluated for ascertaining general status, drug therapy efficacy, and amelioration of Parkinson's disease based on deep brain stimulation parameter settings. Further advance of the accelerometer characterization of Parkinson's disease attributes involves the incorporation of a fully wearable system. Such a system is possible with the integration of wireless 3D MEMS accelerometers. The device proposed incorporates a wireless and potentially wearable 3D MEMS accelerometer mounted on the dorsum of the hand. The wireless 3D MEMS accelerometer system can potentially track the Parkinson's disease status through out real time for a subject at the home-based setting of the subject. An implication of the device is a subject database can be generated quantifying the progression of Parkinson's disease. Drug therapy dosage may be optimized with quantified feedback from the wireless 3D MEMS accelerometer system. Deep brain stimulation parameters may be further refined, and the conceptual foundation for real time deep brain stimulation parameter optimization is established. Enclosed is the initial test and evaluation of the wireless 3D MEMS accelerometer system through the quantification of simulated tremor.","","978-1-4244-3315-5","10.1109/ICCME.2009.4906657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906657","accelerometer;wireless accelerometer;Parkinson's disease quantification","Parkinson's disease;Accelerometers;Micromechanical devices;Brain stimulation;System testing;Drugs;Medical treatment;Real time systems;Databases;Feedback","","40","","21","IEEE","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These are mainly related to steady-state walking. Aim of the present study was to investigate the presence and the degree of these disorders in patients at early stages of PD. For this purpose a group of patients with mild PD (H&Yles2) and a group of age-matched controls were assessed by means of multifactorial analysis of kinematic and kinetic variables, during the execution of the following motor tasks: steady-state walking, gait initiation and turning around an obstacle. Results showed that PD patients did not differ from controls in steady-state walking, while significant differences emerged in gait initiation and turning strategies. Main differences consisted in a limitation of the amplitude of the imbalance phase and of the first step, and, for the turning task, in a delayed initiation of the turning movement, with an altered head-trunk rotational strategy. It is concluded that patients in early stages of PD do not reveal, during steady state walking, consistent impairments of kinematic and kinetic patterns typical of severe PD patients. Nevertheless, they present significant alterations in transient conditions such as gait initiation and change of walking direction. The above results suggest that a quantitative analysis of locomotor tasks which imply the transition from one condition to another, could provide parameters useful for the characterization of early stage PD patients and, potentially, markers for a precox differential diagnosis respect other neurodegenerative diseases characterized by parkinsonisms","1557-170X","1-4244-0032-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4461979","","Parkinson's disease;Legged locomotion;Turning;Kinetic theory;Steady-state;Motion analysis;Muscles;Pelvis;Kinematics;Cities and towns","Aged;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Movement;Oxygen Consumption;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease","27","","23","IEEE","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many common symptoms which may or may not indicate that patient is suffering from Parkinson Disease. In this study a novel rating scale has been introduced which helps to examine the level of Parkinson Disease but is not mandatory that a person having similar symptoms may surely suffering from Parkinson Disease. PD is an unsolved problem till date hence the study focuses on relevant features, drugs and common techniques used to detect or analyze PD. To overcome such problem different techniques will be used to study and analyze the early detection of PD. It can be analyzed with the help of deep understanding of Parkinson Disease. However presence of some common symptoms has not yet been described up to the mark to analyze the level of Parkinson Disease. Hence it is very challenging to detect early stage of Parkinson Disease. In study, work focuses on only confirmed symptoms of Parkinson Disease which doesn't deals to any other disease completely. Study also focus on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale (UPDRS) for Parkinson Disease along with respective symptoms. It includes the analysis in terms of medical science and computer applications for analyzing PD. Medication for PD has also been discussed in the study including wide literature survey which provide the clearance of the goal for treating PD.

Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), a non-invasive method, could potentially improve the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but the mechanisms are unclear. Biomarkers based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) are being actively pursued. Here we examine the properties of EEG microstates as a potential GVS-sensitive EEG biomarker, whereby multichannel, broadband EEG signals are approximated by a sequence of discrete spatial patterns. We used the Microstate Analysis plugin for EEGLAB and compared the characteristics between healthy (n=20) and people with PD (n=22, stimulated/sham, and OFF Medication/ ON Medication). We extracted 25 Microstate related features from 4 different microstates (‘A’ - ‘D’) and examined their differences between groups (a healthy control group was considered as the reference to extract the feature values). Overall disease severity, as assessed by the clinical Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3, was predictable from microstate features. The duration of microstate A - selected by LASSO during UPDRS prediction- was significantly changed by both types of GVS stimuli (multi-sine 50–100 Hz (GVS1), and multi-sine 100–150 Hz (GVS2)), but not medication. The fraction of total recording time for microstate C, also a key feature in disease prediction, was found to be selectively affected GVS1 only. The above results suggest that GVS may provide benefits complementary to medication but in a stimulus-dependent manner. These results could potentially guide optimal GVS design in the pursuit of complementary therapies.","","979-8-3503-9717-8","10.1109/ICBME57741.2022.10053026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053026","Electroencephalography;Microstate analysis;Parkinson's disease;Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS);lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)","Neurological diseases;Electric potential;Parkinson's disease;Deep brain stimulation;Medical treatment;Biomarkers;Feature extraction","","","","30","IEEE","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After preprocessing the data, feature selection is done by the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) method. In the classification step, Random Forest (RF) is used as a classifier model for two tasks, including (1) classifying the subjects to PD and Healthy Control (HC), and (2) determining the disease severity level by Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) scale. The clinical data used is taken from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, which is the most prominent source of data for PD.

Unlike our previous works and the majority of the published studies, where UPDRS tasks were the sole focus, in this paper, we carry out a comparative investigation of the LA, S2S, and G tasks. In particular, after providing an accurate description of the features identified for the kinematic characterization of the three tasks, we comment on the correlation between the most relevant kinematic parameters and the UPDRS scoring. We analyzed the performance achieved by the automatic UPDRS scoring system and compared the estimated UPDRS evaluation with the one performed by neurologists, showing that the proposed system compares favorably with typical interrater variability. We then investigated the correlations between the UPDRS scores assigned to the various tasks by both the neurologists and the automatic system. The results, based on a limited number of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) (34 patients, 47 clinical trials), show poor-to-moderate correlations between the UPDRS scores of different tasks, highlighting that the patients' motor performance may vary significantly from one task to another, since different tasks relate to different aspects of the disease. An aggregate UPDRS score is also considered as a concise parameter, which can provide additional information on the overall level of the motor impairments of a Parkinson's patient. Finally, we discuss a possible implementation of a practical e-health application for the remote monitoring of PD patients.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2472640","Italian Ministry of Health(grant numbers:RF-2009-1472190); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7222382","Body Sensor Network (BSN);Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU);Parkinson’s Disease (PD);Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS);Leg Agility (LA) task;Sit-to- Stand (S2S) task;Gait (G) task;Body sensor network (BSN);gait (G) task;inertial measurement unit (IMU);leg agility (LA) task;Parkinson's disease (PD);sit-to-stand (S2S) task;unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS)","Kinematics;Feature extraction;Parkinson's disease;Body sensor networks","Adult;Aged;Biomechanical Phenomena;Female;Gait;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Posture;Telerehabilitation","78","","31","IEEE","25 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The great majority of studies, however are related to severe forms of PD patients (phases of Hoehn and Yahr scale), where locomotor abnormalities are clearly manifested. Goal of the present study was to quantitatively describe locomotor symptoms in subjects with mild PD. Accordingly, a multitask protocol involving instrumental analysis of steady-state linear walking, initiation of gait, and turning while walking was applied to a group of patients with idiopathic PD in their early clinical stage (phases 1 and 2 of Hoehn and Yahr scale), as well as in age-matched elderly controls. Kinematic, kinetic, and myoelectric measures were obtained by optoelectronic motion analysis, force platform, and telemetric electromyography. Results in PD patients showed a tendency to bradykinetic gait, with reduction of walking speed and cadence. Impairments of gait initiation consisted in reduction of the backward shift of the center of pressure (CoP) and prolongation of the stepping phase. Alterations of the turning task were more consistent and included delayed reorientation of the head toward the new direction, altered head-upper trunk rotational strategy, and adoption of a greater number of steps to complete the turning. It is concluded that patients in the early stage of PD reveal mild alterations of steady-state linear walking and more significant anomalies in the transitional conditions, especially during changes in the travel direction. Quantitative analysis of nonstationary locomotor tasks might be a potentially useful starting point for further studies on the pathophysiology of PD.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.908933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359233","Early stage Parkinson's disease;gait;initiation of gait;turning while walking;Early Stage Parkinson's disease;gait;initiation of gait;turning while walking","Parkinson's disease;Legged locomotion;Steady-state;Turning;Force measurement;Protocols;Instruments;Senior citizens;Kinematics;Kinetic theory","Aged;Ankle;Biomechanics;Electromyography;Female;Foot;Gait;Hip Joint;Humans;Knee Joint;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Anatomic;Motor Activity;Parkinson Disease;Reference Values;Walking","131","","40","IEEE","12 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although a number of methods have been developed to estimate time-dependent brain connectivity, there is a paucity of studies examining the utility of brain dynamics for assessing brain disease states. Therefore, this paper aims to assess brain connectivity dynamics in Parkinson's disease (PD) and determine the utility of such dynamic graph measures as potential components to an imaging biomarker. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 29 healthy controls and 69 PD subjects. Time-varying functional connectivity was first estimated using a sliding windowed sparse inverse covariance matrix. Then, a collection of graph measures, including the Fiedler value, were computed and the dynamics of the graph measures were investigated. The results demonstrated that PD subjects had a lower variability in the Fiedler value, modularity, and global efficiency, indicating both abnormal dynamic global integration and local segregation of brain networks in PD. Autoregressive models fitted to the dynamic graph measures suggested that Fiedler value, characteristic path length, global efficiency, and modularity were all less deterministic in PD. With canonical correlation analysis, the altered dynamics of functional connectivity networks, and particularly dynamic Fiedler value, were shown to be related with disease severity and other clinical variables including age. Similarly, Fiedler value was the most important feature for classification. Collectively, our findings demonstrate altered dynamic graph properties, and in particular the Fiedler value, provide an additional dimension upon which to non-invasively and quantitatively assess PD.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2875456","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701158); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:1808085QF184); PPRI/UBC Chair in Parkinson's Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489893","Graph theory;resting-state functional MRI;brain connectivity;dynamic;Parkinson's disease","Covariance matrices;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Biomedical signal processing;Parkinson's disease;Biomedical imaging;Neurophysiology;Graph theory","Aged;Algorithms;Brain;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Nerve Net;Parkinson Disease","51","","41","IEEE","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these shortcomings, a portable system was developed to continuously monitor Parkinsonian symptoms with quantitative measures based on electrical signals from muscle activity (EMG). Here, we present the system design and the implementation of methods for system validation. This system was designed to provide continuous measures of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are related to the neurophysiological source without the need for multiple bulky experimental apparatuses, thus allowing more precise, quantitative indicators of the symptoms which can be measured during practical daily living tasks. This measurement system has the potential to improve the diagnosis of PD as well as the evaluation of PD treatments, which is an important step in the path to improving PD treatments.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626133","","Electromyography;Parkinson's disease;Current measurement;Monitoring;Electrodes;Force;Accelerometers","Activities of Daily Living;Electromyography;Humans;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Quadriceps Muscle;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telemedicine;Telemetry;Wrist","15","","13","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wearable sensors have been demonstrated to help overcoming such a difficulty, by providing objective measures of motor abnormalities. However, up to now, those sensors have been used on advanced PD patients with evident motor impairment. As a novelty, here we report the impact of wearable sensors in the evaluation of motor abnormalities in newly diagnosed, untreated, namely de novo, patients. Methods: A network of wearable sensors was used to measure motor capabilities, in 30 de novo PD patients and 30 healthy subjects, while performing five motor tasks. Measurement data were used to determine motor features useful to highlight impairments and were compared with the corresponding clinical scores. Three classifiers were used to differentiate PD from healthy subjects. Results: Motor features gathered from wearable sensors showed a high degree of significance in discriminating the early untreated de novo PD patients from the healthy subjects, with 95% accuracy. The rates of severity obtained from the measured features are partially in agreement with the clinical scores, with some highlighted, though justified, exceptions. Conclusion: Our findings support the feasibility of adopting wearable sensors in the detection of motor anomalies in early, untreated, PD patients. Significance: This work demonstrates that subtle motor impairments, occurring in de novo patients, can be evidenced by means of wearable sensors, providing clinicians with instrumental tools as suitable supports for early diagnosis, and subsequent management.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2903627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8662663","IMU;machine learning;motion analysis;parkinson's disease;signal processing;wearable technology","Task analysis;Wearable sensors;Biomedical measurement;Parkinson's disease;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","Accelerometry;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;Machine Learning;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Physiologic;Movement;Parkinson Disease;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wearable Electronic Devices","63","","54","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In an effort to remedy such delay, analysis of data passively captured from user's interaction with consumer technologies has been recently explored towards remote screening of early PD motor signs. In the current study, a smartphone-based method analyzing subjects' finger interaction with the smartphone screen is developed for the quantification of fine-motor skills decline in early PD using Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results from the analysis of keystroke typing in-the-clinic data from 18 early PD patients and 15 healthy controls have shown a classification performance of 0.89 Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 0.79/0.79 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. Evaluation of the generalization ability of the proposed approach was made by its application on typing data arising from a separate self-reported cohort of 27 PD patients' and 84 healthy controls' daily usage with their personal smartphones (data in-the-wild), achieving 0.79 AUC with 0.74/0.78 sensitivity/specificity, respectively.

The movement of the skin above the forearm muscles and tendons correlates with the extension and flexion of fingers and hands. This way, the small gap of 0.5 cm between the polymer layers is displaced, generating voltage due to the triboelectric contact. Signals from preliminary experiments can discriminate different dynamics of emulated tremor and bradykinesia in hands and fingers. A modified version of the TS is integrated with a printed circuit board (PCB) in a single package with signal conditioning and wireless data transmission.

Ideally, identification is the best practice for control and intervention; nevertheless, traditional approaches used in diagnosing may fail to detect the disease during its early stage. This paper aims to determine whether DBNs are suitable for detecting PD early since they can assess complicated and high-dimensional medical information. During the DBN modelling, the data used here were trained and tested using publicly available datasets, and the accuracy level recorded was 92 percent. In comparison, the sensitivity was 90 percent, and the specificity was 94 percent. The ROC-AVC of the timing of task execution was calculated to be 0. 95 percent in the diagnostic capacity, which indeed indicates the high level had been maintained. According to the above results, the DBN model provided superior performance to other diagnostic methods, which include a low false-negative rate. Traditional techniques, where the diagnosis depends on a doctor's assignment and imaging techniques, are usually less accurate and take more time to detect diseases early. It is crucial to note that this research proves the DBN model's feature of recognizing little deviations that hint at early-stage Parkinson's disease, making for a robust and practical diagnostic application. In clinical practice, the DBN model has been used numerous times, all of which pointed to the identification of early-stage Parkinson's disease patients who had not been diagnosed at all or were diagnosed with other disorders.","","979-8-3503-7971-6","10.1109/GlobalAISummit62156.2024.10947917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10947917","Deep Belief Network;Convolutional Neural Networks;Parkinson's Diseases;Deep Learning;Decentralized Machine Learning;Privacy-Preserving AI","Solid modeling;Accuracy;Sensitivity;Parkinson's disease;Solids;Data models;Timing;Reliability;Medical diagnostic imaging;Standards","","","","20","IEEE","9 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ten patients undergoing deep brain stimulation and twenty controls were tested using 3D kinematic motion analysis. Parkinsonian patients under basal conditions walked more slowly and with reduced arm and leg swing compared to controls. Moreover, they displayed significant impairments of the normal interlimb coordination. Both STN stimulation and L-dopa increased the walking speed and the amplitude of arm and leg swing movements. Additional improvements of the coordination between upper and lower limb were documented by reductions of the phase-shift between arm and ipsilateral leg motion, with displacement toward the control range (perfect counterphase). STN stimulation alone and L-dopa alone produced similar effects on the variables analyzed. The combination of the two treatments, instead, yielded additive effects on the gait speed and a slight increase of the upper and lower limb range of motion, in the absence of further improvements in the inter-segmental coordination. Moreover, whereas the increased arm swing could be accounted by the sole adoption of a higher gait speed, both the increment of the leg movement amplitude and the decreased interlimb phase shift appeared to imply an additional effect, possibly related to the treatment. These results may suggest that differential supraspinal controls operate on the neural networks subserving upper and lower limb motion during human walking.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4353888","","Leg;Parkinson's disease;Legged locomotion;Motion control;Brain stimulation;Testing;Kinematics;Motion analysis;Displacement control;Additives","Aged;Antiparkinson Agents;Arm;Deep Brain Stimulation;Gait;Humans;Leg;Levodopa;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Subthalamic Nucleus","8","","16","IEEE","22 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, we employ sensor systems to collect tremor parameters from PD patients and analyzed these collected data using traditional machine learning algorithms, providing an objective and quantitative diagnosis for PD. To obtain more comprehensive features, this study adopts the PKG wearable device to extract 12 tremor features from 100 PD patients, along with recording 9 scale-based features and 3 demographic characteristics. Furthermore, to overcome the issues of low accuracy and poor generalization ability of traditional machine learning methods, we propose a capsule network integrated with a self-attention mechanism (SA-CapsNet) for classifying and predicting early stage and moderate to advanced stage stage PD patients. We also utilize the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve the model's ability to generalize. Lastly, The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model is introduced to improve the interpretability of the predictive model, and feature analysis is conducted to identify the main factors influencing classification and prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the SA-CapsNet method for PD can achieve an accuracy of 92.31%, precision of 82.19%, recall of 91.23%, specificity of 80.00%, and an F1 score of 85.25%. Therefore, the proposed SACapsNet method not only exhibits good generalization ability for small sample sizes and imbalanced class data but also effectively assists physicians in staging the severity of PD.","","979-8-3315-3311-3","10.1109/ICCECE65250.2025.10984872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10984872","Parkinson's Disease (PD);Wearable Sensor Devices;Rating Scale;Self-Attention Mechanism;Capsule Network","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Medical services;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Sensor systems;Data mining;Wearable devices;Wearable sensors","","","","16","IEEE","15 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite over a decade of the practical clinical experience, the selections of DBS parameters are still challenging. DBS affects the local cells within the target site as well as the passing axons within neighboring regions. A computational model of basal ganglia-thalamic network is formed to analyze the performance of DBS at STN, GPe, and GPi in terms of error index. In addition to single-site stimulation, multiple-site stimulation is also analyzed for DBS of STN-GPe and STN-GPi in terms of error index.

Later, ten Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) implantation participated in gait measurements using our device. They walked one to three times on a 20-m walkway. Patients did the test twice: once STN-DBS was ON and once 180 min after turning it OFF. A group of ten age-matched normal subjects were also measured as controls. For each gait cycle, spatio-temporal parameters such as stride length (SL), stride velocity (SV), stance (ST), double support (DS), and gait cycle time (GC) were calculated. We found that PD patients had significantly different gait parameters comparing to controls. They had 52% less SV, 60% less SL, and 40% longer GC. Also they had significantly longer ST and DS (11% and 59% more, respectively) than controls. STN-DBS significantly improved gait parameters. During the stim ON period, PD patients had 31% faster SV, 26% longer SL, 6% shorter ST, and 26% shorter DS. GC, however, was not significantly different. Some of the gait parameters had high correlation with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) subscores including SL with a significant correlation (r=-0.90) with UPDRS gait subscore.

This paper reports tasks to elicit a versatile sample of voice production, algorithms to extract useful information from speech and models to predict the severity of the disease. Apart from standard features from time domain (e.g., energy, speaking rate), spectral domain (e.g., pitch, spectral entropy) and cepstral domain (e.g, mel-frequency warped cepstral coefficients), we also estimate harmonic-to-noise ratio, shimmer and jitter using our recently developed algorithms. In a preliminary study, we evaluate the proposed paradigm on data collected through 2 clinics from 82 subjects in 116 assessment sessions. Our results show that the information extracted from speech, elicited through 3 tasks, can predict the severity of the disease to within a mean absolute error of 5.7 with respect to the clinical assessment using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; the range of target motor sub-scale is 0 to 108. Our analysis shows that elicitation of speech through less constrained task provides useful information not captured in widely employed phonation task.

In this work, an attempt is made to discriminate between the normal and Parkinson's disease subjects by morphological changes in the striatum. SPECT neuroimaging modality has been used for this study. DAT SPECT images were downloaded and analyzed. The striatum region on both the left and right hemispheres is segmented. Geometrical changes seen in the segmented region is quantified by various parameters. Geometric features such as area, axis length, extent and circularity measures show significant changes differentiating between normal and Parkinson's disease. The orthogonal image moments extracted from the striatum discriminates between HC and PD with higher significant values.

The ASAP protocol measures grip force as an individual tracks a sinusoidal or pseudorandom target force under three conditions of increasing cognitive load. Thirty individuals with PD have completed the ASAP protocol. The ASAP data for 26 of these individuals were summarized in terms of 36 variables, and modified regression techniques were used to predict an individual's score on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale based on ASAP data. We observed a mean prediction error of approximately 3.5 UPDRS points, and the predicted score accounted for approximately 76% of the variability of the UPDRS. These results demonstrate that the ASAP protocol can measure differences for individuals who are clinically different.

Our primary goal is to develop a monitoring system capable of being used outside of controlled laboratory settings. Such a system would enable us to track medication cycles at home and provide valuable clinical feedback. Most of the relevant prior works involve supervised learning frameworks (e.g., Support Vector Machines). However, in-home monitoring provides only coarse ground truth information about symptom occurrences, making it very hard to adapt and train supervised learning classifiers for symptom detection. We address this challenge by formulating symptom detection under incomplete ground truth information as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. MIL is a weakly supervised learning framework that does not require exact instances of symptom occurrences for training; rather, it learns from approximate time intervals within which a symptom might or might not have occurred on a given day. Once trained, the MIL detector was able to spot symptom-prone time windows on other days and approximately localize the symptom instances. We monitored two Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, each for four days with a set of five triaxial accelerometers and utilized a MIL algorithm based on axis parallel rectangle (APR) fitting in the feature space. We were able to detect subject specific symptoms (e.g. dyskinesia) that conformed with a daily log maintained by the patients.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346767","Parkinson's Disease (PD);continuous motor symptom monitoring;multiple instance learning","Monitoring;Supervised learning;Accelerometers;Training;Frequency domain analysis;Feature extraction;Diseases","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Dyskinesias;Dyskinesias;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Physiologic;Motor Activity;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease","21","","19","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brain MRI scans have demonstrated the ability to identify Parkinson's disease at earlier stages; however, manual diagnosis is timeconsuming and prone to individual error. To facilitate the automatic detection of Parkinson's disease from brain MRI images, this project employs deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed system encompasses several critical steps: data preprocessing, feature extraction, CNN model training, and performance assessment. Utilizing CNNs enables the system to automatically identify complex patterns in MRI scans indicative of Parkinson's disease, leading to faster and more accurate diagnoses.

For the computerized disease diagnosis of various diseases, there have been significant advancements in thermometers, digital devices, health monitoring systemsand digital equipment. These computerized tools help clinicians diagnose illnesses precisely and effectively. A neurodegenerative condition that affects the neurological system is Parkinson's disease. Numerous initiatives have been made throughout the years to effectively diagnose Parkinson's disease automatically. For analysis and detection, a variety of datasets have been used, counting voice data samples, radiological pictures, gait specimens and handwriting samples. Widespread usage of methods like deep learning and machine learning has produced encouraging outcomes. The ageing neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs both cognitive as well as motor function. Although the cause of PD is largely understood, genetic factors and environmental conditions are probably concerned. In contrast, the pathophysiology of Parkinson Disease at the network level is quite well characterized. The motor manifestations of PD treatment can be effective with several medicines. Additionally, simulation of deep brain activity is frequently used to indulge in medication-resistant Parkinson's disease (DBS). Despite DBS's effectiveness in treating Parkinson's, nothing is learned about how it functions. Worldwide, several millions of people get affected with this PD. Around 1% of persons over 60 have Parkinson's disease, and as people get older, their symptoms get worse. Patients may suffer irregularities in speech and voice that may go unnoticed by listeners but that can be examined utilizing recorded speech signals. Because of the enormous technological breakthroughs, there is a need to use data mining andmachine learning methods to extract scientific understanding from the vast amounts of medical data that have been generated. To scrutinize medical data sets and diagnose issues like Parkinson's disease, various categorization approaches were applied (PD). Additionally, feature selection techniques have been widely applied in various sectors to enhance classification performance.","","979-8-3503-2230-9","10.1109/AISC56616.2023.10085219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10085219","Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS);Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF);Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF);Dopamine Transporter (DAT);Essential Tremor (ET);Parkinson’s Disease (PD);MultiEdit Nearest Neighbour (MENN);Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI);Grey Matter (GM);Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP);Relevance vector regression (RVR);Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD);Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)","Deep learning;Radiography;Thermometers;Parkinson's disease;Satellite broadcasting;Radiology;Feature extraction","","","","18","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods for diagnosing PD include a section where a trained specialist scores qualitative symptoms using the motor subscale of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III). The aim of this feasibility study was twofold. First, to evaluate quiet standing as an additional, out-of-clinic, objective feature to predict UPDRS-III subscores related to motor symptom severity; and second, to use quiet standing to detect the presence of motor symptoms. Force plate data were collected from 42 PD patients and 43 healthy controls during quiet standing (a task involving standing still with eyes open and closed) as a feasible task in clinics. Predicting each subscore of the UPDRS-III could aid in identifying progression of PD and provide specialists additional tools to make an informed diagnosis. Random Forest feature importance indicated that features correlated with range of center of pressure (i.e., the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior sway) were most useful in the prediction of the top PD prediction subscores of postural stability (r = 0.599; p = 0.014), hand tremor of the left hand (r = 0.650; p = 0.015), and tremor at rest of the left upper extremity (r = 0.703; p = 0.016).

In this work, we present a new approach that combines the assessment of CNN deep learning models and RF in diagnosing PD based on neuroimages and clinical information. CNN provides feature extraction capability, while RF provides classification capacity, and the model combines these two characteristics, leading to high diagnostic performance. The proposed approach is then evaluated on an available real dataset, which includes MRI images and other clinical features like motor UPDRS scores, cognitive test results, age, and gender, and the experimental outcomes are reported. Based on the authors' experimental findings, the hybrid CNN-RF model produced the highest accuracy of 93 %. 7% outperforming CNN and RF standalone models with accuracies of 88. 4% and 85. The model also erected a high sensitivity of 94. 2 % and a specificity of 92. 8% provided a reliable model for differentiating PD cases and the control group. The first metric is ROC with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of0. 96, hence adding to the confirmation of the workability of the model when discriminating between the classes. The assessments of motor UPDRS scores suggested that they were essential predictors of PD and that specific brain regions revealed by the CNN were also important indicators of PD. Although the model can achieve high accuracy, this paper has shown the limitations of relying on labelled data. Therefore, it is suggested that future work may consider utilizing semi-supervised learning.","","979-8-3503-7952-5","10.1109/INSPECT63485.2024.10896101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10896101","Parkinson's Disease;Machine Learning;Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM);Deep Learning;Neural Networks","Radio frequency;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Motors;Feature extraction;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Reliability","","","","17","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This impairment of neurons leads to a decrease in dopamine production, which is the primary cause of Parkinson's disease. PD impairs motor functions and hinders cognitive and emotional stability, noticeably degrading the patient's quality of life. While PD remains incurable, proper diagnosis, early detection, and timely medication can assist PD patients in their healthier aging. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals represent the brain's electrical activity and provide critical insights into neural activities. Existing methods in deep learning necessitate manual feature extraction, which requires domain expertise. Hence, this work represents an automated hybrid CNN-BiLSTM neural network architecture that predicts Parkinson's disease using rest-EEG signals. First, we design three 1–D CNN layers to extract the spatiotemporal relationship across the EEG channels. Subsequently, we utilize BiLSTM to identify temporal characteristics relevant to classifying these spatiotemporal features.

We evaluated a 56 year old male and 66 year old female with idiopathic Parkinson's disease chronically implanted with bilateral STN-DBS. Patients performed a button press task while off medication in the DBS-on and DBS-off conditions. Movements of the upper limb were recorded using a 3D motion analysis system, and detailed kinematic measures were obtained for the arm and forearm. As expected, reaction and movement times were improved in the DBS-on compared to DBSoff condition. The two subjects differed with regards to the magnitude of their changes in peak linear velocity and peak angular velocities (shoulder flexion extension, shoulder abduction adduction and elbow flexion extension). Surprisingly, both PD patients increased the frequency with which they used a preferred sequence of shoulder and elbow joint activations when in the DBS-on condition. This preferred pattern was adopted with twice the frequency than in the DBS-off condition, and with increased frequency relative to a control group of 9 age-matched controls.

Human motion analysis techniques can be very useful to support clinical assessment of this type of diseases. In this contribution, we present a RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect) system and its evaluation for PD assessment. Based on skeleton data extracted from the gait of three PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation and three control subjects, several gait parameters were computed and analyzed, with the aim of discriminating between non-PD and PD subjects, as well as between two PD states (stimulator ON and OFF). We verified that among the several quantitative gait parameters, the variance of the center shoulder velocity presented the highest discriminative power to distinguish between non-PD, PD ON and PD OFF states (p = 0.004). Furthermore, we have shown that our low-cost portable system can be easily mounted in any hospital environment for evaluating patients' gait. These results demonstrate the potential of using a RGB-D camera as a PD assessment tool.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944285","","Joints;Cameras;Sensors;Parkinson's disease;Legged locomotion;Elbow","Deep Brain Stimulation;Female;Gait;Humans;Joints;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Photography;User-Computer Interface","36","","14","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These technologies could provide less obtrusive and more comfortable remote symptom monitoring. The recent studies showed that motor symptoms of PD can reliably be detected from data gathered via smartphones.

From this dataset, 1237 subjects (616 had PD) who were age and gender matched were selected and classified into PD and non-PD categories. Linear acceleration (ACC) and gyroscope (GYRO) were recorded by built-in sensors of smartphones. Walking bouts were extracted by thresholding signal magnitude area of the ACC signals. Features were computed from both ACC and GYRO signals and fed into a random forest classifier of size 128 trees.

The data were compared with the motor scores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Assessment Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn-Yahr Staging Scale. The results showed that the motor UPDRS scores and the Hoehn-Yahr Staging scale were consistent. Furthermore, it was seen that the rigidity enhancing effect of the Froment maneuver can be distinguished by the established system. It was noted that the stiffness scores with Froment maneuver measurements made for the same patient were 1 point higher than the stiffness scores without Froment maneuver measurements. Also; As a result of the comparison made with the stiffness scoring performed by the physician, it was found that the stiffness data obtained were generally consistent with the physician scoring. However, according to the data obtained, some physician scoring deviations from normal were determined. As a result of these studies, a lower-upper limit was established for stiffness values evaluated between 0-4 points.

The method utilizes eigenvectors of matrices of accelerations to compare time-normalized right leg and left leg gait cycles of patients and healthy subjects. Four accelerometers were placed on patient's arms and legs to measure accelerations in the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and inferior-superior directions. Subjects accomplished an extended Timed Up & Go Test (TUG). Using the eigenvectors we confirmed the hypothesis that patients with PD have asymmetrical movements of the limbs. Omitting medication 24 hours before the measurement in patients with early stage Parkinson's disease did not affect the synkinesias of walking patients. Findings suggest the possibility of the designed application of eigenvectors for use in drug therapy in patients with PD by evaluating postural stability via measuring accelerations.

This paper describes a single accelerometer-based gait analysis system for the assessment of ambulatory gait properties. Acceleration data were recorded continuously for up to 24 h from normal and PD subjects, from which gait peaks were picked out and the relationship between gait cycle and vertical gait acceleration was evaluated. By fitting a model equation to the relationships, a quantitative index was obtained for characterizing the subjects' walking behavior. The averaged index for PD patients with gait disorder was statistically smaller than the value for normal subjects.

At discrete intervals, there were bifurcations of each track, and the subject had to follow either the inside or outside track requiring squeezing at 5% or 15% of maximum voluntary contraction. During the control condition (Control), subjects had to follow the inside and outside tracks alternately. In the timing (Timing) and selection (Selection) tasks, the time between bifurcations jittered randomly and the color of the bar determined which path to choose, respectively. We determined which Regions of Interest (ROIs) were activated at the time of bifurcations, by assessing both the connectivity between ROIs and the timing of activation. The caudate and putamen were activated in both (Selection-Control) and (Timing-Control) contrasts in all subjects, however only in PD subjects was the amygdala significantly activated. In addition, the amygdala was activated faster in both Selection and Timing tasks compared to the Control task in PD subjects.

The goal of this study was to test the ability of a trunk accelerometer system to quantify the effects of PD on several gait features when walking at self-selected speed. Methods: We recruited 96 subjects split into three age-matched groups: 32 healthy controls (HC), 32 PD patients at Hoehn and Yahr stage <; II (PD-1), and 32 patients at Hoehn and Yahr stage II-III (PD-2). The following outcomes were extracted from the signals of the triaxial accelerometer worn on the lower back: stride length, cadence, regularity index, symmetry index, and mechanical powers yielded in the cranial-caudal, anteroposterior, and medial-lateral directions. Walking speed was measured using a stopwatch. Results: Besides other gait features, the PD-1 and the PD-2 groups showed significantly reduced stride length normalized to height (p <; 0.02) and symmetry index (p <; 0.009) in comparison to the HC. Regularity index was the only feature significantly decreased in the PD-2 group as compared with the two other groups (p <; 0.01). The clinical relevance of this finding was supported by significant correlations with mobility and gait scales (r is around -0.3; p <; 0.05).

Traditionally, tremor has been evaluated using frequency domain analysis. However, in many cases, this analysis did not show significant differences comparing healthy elders and individuals with PD. Given its complex nature, recently the interest in nonlinear dynamical analysis for better understanding of tremor has grown. In this paper, we examine the effect of PD on the complexity of the tremor time series of PD patients using the approximate entropy method (ApEn). Tremor was also evaluated in the frequency domain. This study involved 11 healthy and 11 PD patients. The peak frequency was similar in both groups, while the amplitude and power in the peak frequency and the total power were significantly higher in PD patients (p<;0.0001). A significant reduction (p<;0.001) in ApEn was observed in PD. ROC analysis showed that ApEn differentiated physiological tremor from tremor in PD patients with high accuracy. These results are in close agreement with pathophysiological fundamentals, and provide evidence that in PD patients the tremor pattern becomes less complex. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that ApEn has a high clinical potential in assessing PD patients.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626365","","Time series analysis;Parkinson's disease;Complexity theory;Biomedical measurements;Frequency domain analysis;Accuracy","Acceleration;Aged;Area Under Curve;Biomechanics;Biometry;Female;Fingers;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;ROC Curve;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors","15","","24","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, there is no definitive biomarker to early detect and diagnose the disease (80% of the dopaminergic neurons are lost at first diagnosis). Recently, neuroimages have allowed to discover radiological markers associated with structural alterations from routine T1-MRI, and even measure dopamine activations in specialized SPECT sequences. Nonetheless, SPECT sequences are highly specialized, with low availability in clinical centers, and the respective analysis and quantification remain subjective and poorly explored. This work introduces a self-supervised deep representation able to capture dopaminergic levels from an MRI-to-SPECT transformation, learning an embedding representation with the capability to classify between Parkinson’s and control subjects. From a retrospective study with a set of 73 Parkinson’s and 73 control patients, the proposed approach achieved a notable discrimination of 79% in the precision metric.Clinical relevance— A self-supervised representation that under a translation MRI-to-SPECT task, can code dopaminergic levels to discriminate between control and Parkinson’s subjects.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782073","Parkinson’s disease;Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT);Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);self-supervised learning;non-aligned projections","Codes;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neurons;Estimation;Motors;Resonance;Proposals;Single photon emission computed tomography;Engineering in medicine and biology;Diseases","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Dopamine;Male;Female;Middle Aged;Aged;Dopaminergic Neurons;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Retrospective Studies","","","17","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The precise mechanism for differences in function following exercise is unknown. We examined the complexity of biomechanical and physiological features of forced and voluntary cycling and correlated these features to improvements in motor function as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Heart rate, cadence, and power were analyzed using entropy signal processing techniques. Pattern variability in heart rate and power were greater in the voluntary group when compared to forced group. In contrast, variability in cadence was higher during forced cycling. UPDRS Motor III scores predicted from the pattern variability data were highly correlated to measured scores in the forced group. This study shows how time series analysis methods of biomechanical and physiological parameters of exercise can be used to predict improvements in motor function.

In this paper, we review that work and show that a differential diagnosis can be produced directly from the analog speech signal itself. In addition, differentiation can be made between seven different degrees of progression of the disease (including healthy). Such a system can act as an additional stage (or another building block) in a bigger system of natural speech processing. For example it could be used in automatic speech recognition systems that are used as personal assistants (such as Iphones' Siri, Google Voice), or as natural man-machine interfaces.

Facial feature detection was conducted using OpenCV and Dlib libraries for the precise localization of key landmarks. In the subsequent feature extraction, parameters such as symmetry, eye aspect ratio, mouth corner distance, muscle tension, and mouth aperture ratio were used. Through the standardization of these features, meaningful comparisons across diverse images were made.

Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFUS) is a viable non-invasive alternative to modulate the cortico-subcortical networks involved in PD. In this study, an intramembrane cavitation model was used to simulate the effects of ultrasonic stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus in a simplified validated model of the cortico-subcortical network. Simulation results from single neuron and network models show the ultrasonic stimulus was effective in producing neuronal excitation in the subthalamic nucleus as well as modulation of activities in other nuclei of the network model (e.g., globus pallidus and thalamus). Additionally, depending on LIFUS parameters (i.e., amplitude and duty cycle) there was a reduction in beta-band parkinsonian oscillations to values close to the healthy condition. Exploratory tests of the stimulus parametric space revealed different operating ranges that could be used to optimize the therapeutic response to LIFUS. In conclusion, the membrane cavitation framework provides reasons to believe that LIFUS would be a potential therapeutic intervention to modulate neuronal circuits involved in PD without surgical procedures. Also, the model employed in the present study would be helpful in exploring other neuromodulation effects of ultrasound waves in neuronal circuits in the brain. However, it is important to validate the results from the computer simulations using both experiments with animal models and clinical trials with humans.","1948-3554","978-1-6654-6292-1","10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123760","low-intensity focused ultrasound;Parkinson's disease;biophysical simulation","Ultrasonic imaging;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Surgery;Brain modeling;Thalamus;Acoustics","","1","","16","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method uses cyclogram characteristics such as the slope, second moment of area and the area of the cyclogram to compare movements of left and right side of body. For symmetric movement, cyclogram should lie on a symmetry line passing through the origin inclined at an angle 45°. To study the body movement, measurement was performed using accelerometers (Xsens Technologies B.V.). Four accelerometers were placed on subject's arms and legs to measure accelerations in the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and inferior-superior directions. Subjects (patients and healthy subjects) accomplished an extended Timed Up & Go Test (TUG). The data from the accelerometers were preprocessed, and then the bilateral cyclograms of two synchronized accelerations were created and evaluated. Using the cyclograms we confirmed the hypothesis that patients with PD have asymmetrical movements of the limbs. Omitting medication 24 hours before the measurement in patients with early stage PD had little effect on the synkinesias of gait. Findings suggest the possibility of the designed application of wearable MoCap system and bilateral cyclograms for use in drug therapy by evaluating postural stability via measuring accelerations. Thus, method using accelerometers and bilateral cyclograms is newly proposed for patients with PD.","","978-8-0261-0642-5","10.23919/AE.2017.8053628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053628","accelerometer;bilateral cyclogram;gait;symmetry;Parkinson's disease","Accelerometers;Acceleration;Parkinson's disease;Legged locomotion;Biomedical measurement;Statistical analysis;Motion measurement","","1","","17","","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior to the onset of motor symptoms of PD, patients exhibit alteration in sleep architecture which plays a critical role in consolidating memory, a key cognitive process of the brain. Standard spectral and signal analysis techniques have been recently introduced to exploit the changes in the electroencephalography of sleep related to PD or its cognitive complications including dementia. However, the use of artificial intelligence for the automated detection of the progression of PD to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia in sleep EEG have not yet been investigated. In this paper, we introduce a novel highly accurate variational mode decomposition based deep-learning framework applied on sleep electroencephalography signals in order to classify PD subjects into patients exhibiting normal cognition (NC) or MCI. The proposed framework is capable of detecting MCI at a significantly high 4-fold cross validation accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and quadratic weighted Kappa score of almost 99% offering a rapid and supportive tool for specialists to monitor the progression of PD and ensure the early initiation of efficient therapeutic treatments that will accordingly improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers.","1948-3554","978-1-6654-6292-1","10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123759","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:UL1TR003096-03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123759","Parkinson's Disease;Mild Cognitive Impairment;Variational Mode Decomposition;Deep Learning","Sensitivity;Sleep;Parkinson's disease;Cognitive processes;Neural engineering;Electroencephalography;Signal analysis","","1","","12","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This excessive inhibition seems to explain decreased motor vigor in Parkinson’s disease, but whether it causes tremor remains unclear. This paper explores how inhibition may change closed-loop characteristics to determine how this established pathophysiology could produce tremor. First, single-neuron simulations establish the rate and time characteristics of increased tonic inhibition by adjusting the membrane time constant. These characteristics point towards two possible mechanisms for unstable feedback: information delay and decreased signal. Both cases create a mismatch between the closed-loop dynamics and the forward model that overcomes proprioceptive feedback delays. Overall, unstable feedback stemming from excessive tonic inhibition represents a unifying pathophysiology for the movement inhibiting and excitatory motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10781501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10781501","tremor;Parkinson’s disease;inhibition;feedback","Feedback loop;Firing;Propioception;Motors;Thalamus;Brain modeling;Delays;Feedback control;Engineering in medicine and biology;Diseases","Parkinson Disease;Humans;Feedback, Physiological;Models, Neurological;Neurons","","","17","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the imaging diagnosis of PD, we propose a model in this paper, for early detection of PD using image processing and artificial neural network (ANN). The model used 200 SPECT images, 100 of healthy normal and 100 of PD, obtained from Parkinson's Progression Marker's Initiative (PPMI) database and processed them to find the area of caudate and putamen which is the region of interest (ROI) for this study.

The simple but fast ANN built, could classify subjects with and without PD with an accuracy of 94%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88%.

Although there is no known cause or cure, it is possible to manage symptoms with treatment. PD affects about 7 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 10 million by 2030. Recent studies have explored protein and peptide levels as potential PD biomarkers that could impact Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. In this research paper, we analyze data from 1,019 patients to predict the UPDRS score based on biomarkers. We leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning to identify changes in protein and peptide levels that could serve as useful PD risk biomarkers. These analytical techniques utilize protein and peptide levels from general health screenings of patients for early PD detection to uncover patterns and correlations that enable accurate predictive models for UPDRS. This helps in the early detection of PD, allowing effective management and intervention. Our results show that several proteins and peptides are associated with PD risk. These proteins and peptides have a deep impact on the UPDRS score. We also find that the levels of these proteins and peptides are higher in people with PD than in healthy individuals. Finally, we obtain Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) scores from various machine learning algorithms to measure the accuracy of predictions. Analysis with SMAPE reveals the superiority of Random Forest as the best-performing machine learning technique for PD prediction, with a score of 0.37. In conclusion, PD is a complex disorder without a known cure. However, biomarker analysis with machine learning offers promise for early PD detection and gives clinicians and patients hope for early diagnosis and better treatment strategies.","","979-8-3503-0611-8","10.1109/ICCCIS60361.2023.10425287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10425287","Parkinson's disease (PD);Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS);Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)","Proteins;Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Peptides;Biomarkers;Predictive models;Random forests","","","","15","IEEE","15 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, EEG data are complicated by the fact that data are inherently non-stationary and also the brain may not work on the task continually. To address these concerns, we propose a novel EEG segmentation method based on the temporal dynamics of the cross-spectra of computed independent components.

Although many biomarkers for age and disease exist, the EEG has the benefit that it is widely available, inexpensive, and potentially may act as a biomarker over rapid time scales, which might be beneficial during, e.g., the performance of a specific task such as neurofeedback games. Parkinson's disease (PD) is ideally suited for the exploration of oscillatory biomarkers since abnormal oscillations have been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. Specifically, beta-band oscillations may be broadly considered “anti-kinetic” and seen as inhibiting movement, while gamma-band oscillations are considered “pro-kinetic” and appear to facilitate movement. However, many domain-based EEG features in people with PD overlap considerably with those just seen in normal aging. Here, we contrast the age-related EEG features in PD subjects and age-matched healthy controls (HC). We employed an end-to-end training strategy and built deep recurrent neural network models with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to predict age from 60-s of rest EEG recorded from PD and HC. When reliable models with reasonable errors were found for both groups ($MAE=1.897$ for HC and $MAE=2.172$ for PD), we investigated their deterioration of predictive power when fed frequency band-limited data. In PD subjects, beta and gamma bands in channels T7, FP2, and F7 were significantly more important for predicting age in PD than in HC. After medication, differences in the frequency bands predicting age between PD and controls become more prominent when PD subjects were on medication. Our results suggest that after the development of PD, beta and gamma become more strongly associated with age, implying that future studies examining beta and gamma changes in PD will need to take particular care in controlling for the age of subjects.","","978-1-6654-9984-2","10.1109/ICBME54433.2021.9750334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750334","EEG;RNN;LSTM;Age prediction;EEG sub-bands","Training;Parkinson's disease;Biomarkers;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Data models","","1","","17","IEEE","13 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It not only claims the lives of the patients suffering from it but also adversely impacts the lives of their loved ones. A lot of research is being conducted to find modern medical techniques to tackle the ill effects of the disease. Monitoring the progression of the disease plays a vital role in controlling its various symptoms. Non-conventional ways of monitoring PD (Parkinson's Disease) provide an edge over the existing techniques as it reduces the financial burden and also limits the number of clinical visits required for it. In this research paper, we aim to build a predictive model that accurately predicts the UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) of patients using the data collected through noninvasive speech tests.

Parkinson's disease (PD) belongs to the group of neurological disorder, which directly affect the bra in cells and the effect is shown in terms of movement, voice and other cognitive disabilities. Researchers are keep working on different fields such as gait analysis as well as on speech analysis to find the predictors of the Parkinson's disease. Recently machine learning based approach has been used by many researchers across the field because of its accuracy on the complex data. Machine learning based approach has been used in many cases of Parkinson's disease using gait data as well as voice data. However, so far no body ha s compared the performance metrics using different feature sets by applying non-linear based classification approach based on the voice data. So in this paper we have proposed a new approach by comparing the performance metrics with different feature sets such as original feature sets as well as Principal component Analysis based feature reduction technique for selecting the feature sets. We have used non-linear based classification approach to compare the performance metrics. We have found an accuracy of 96.83% using random forest classifiers using PCA based feature sets.

It is caused by the death of dopamine-producing neurons and primarily affects those over the age of 60.

Though therapeutic, high frequency stimulation consumes significant power forcing frequent surgical battery replacements and causing widespread influence into other brain areas which may lead to adverse side effects. In this paper, we conducted a rigorous study to assess whether low frequency signals can restore behavior in PD patients by restoring neural activity in the BG to the normal state. We used a biophysical-based model of BG nuclei and motor thalamus whose parameters can be set to simulate the normal state and the PD state with and without DBS. We administered pulse train DBS waveforms to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with frequencies ranging from 1-150Hz. For each DBS frequency, we computed statistics on the simulated neural activity to assess whether it is restored to the normal state. In particular, we searched for DBS waveforms that suppress pathological bursting, oscillations, correlations and synchronization prevalent in the PD state and that enable thalamic cells to relay cortical inputs reliably. We found that none of the tested waveforms restores neural activity to the normal state. However, our simulations led us to construct a novel DBS strategy involving low frequency multi-input phaseshifted DBS to be administered into the STN. This strategy successfully suppressed all pathological symptoms in the BG in addition to enabling thalamic cells to relay cortical inputs reliably.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626828","Deep Brain Stimulation;Parkinson's Disease;Spike Trains;Hodgkin-Huxley Models","Satellite broadcasting;Neurons;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Frequency measurement;Basal ganglia;Synchronization","Animals;Basal Ganglia;Computer Simulation;Deep Brain Stimulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Parkinson Disease;Recovery of Function;Therapy, Computer-Assisted","4","","32","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, by using a recurrent structure like LSTM, able to analyze the dynamic nature of the gait cycle, the proposed method extracts the temporal patterns to diagnose patients from healthy persons. Utilized data to extract the temporal shapes of the gait cycle are based on changing vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF), measured by 16 sensors placed in the soles of shoes worn by each subject. To reduce the number of data dimensions, the sequences of corresponding sensors placed in different feet are combined by subtraction. This method analyzes the temporal pattern of time-series collected from different sensors, without extracting special features representing statistics of different parts of the gait cycle. Finally, by recording and presenting data from 10 seconds of subject walking, the proposed approach can diagnose the patient from healthy persons with an average accuracy of 97.66%, and the total F1 score equal to 97.78%.","","978-1-6654-0441-9","10.1109/IKT51791.2020.9345635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345635","Parkinson‘s disease;gait cycle;Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM);wearable sensors","Legged locomotion;Parkinson's disease;Shape measurement;Force;Feature extraction;Wearable sensors;Foot","","5","","13","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study proposes an automatic method to segment Non-PD and PD patients' left and right SN in susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) and Magnitude SWI-derived images. The images used in this study were obtained from the NTUA Parkinson's disease database: 11 SWI image volumes (4 Non-PD and 7 PD) and 8 Magnitude image volumes (3 Non-PD and 5 PD). One Non-PD template was created per each image type to obtain a mask of the left and right SN. All images were registered to the respective template. The segmentation method consisted of setting a seed point based on the masks of 2D image slices created to perform a flood fill algorithm. The method's performance was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between automatic and manual segmentation. The segmentation method achieved higher performance using the SWI images (DSC: SN $=0.684 \pm 0.182$; left SN $=0.722 \pm 0.137$; right SN: $0.664 \pm 0.226$) than using the Magnitude images (DSC: SN $=0.589 \pm 0.249$; left SN $=0.604 \pm 0.223$; right SN $=0.569 \pm$ 0.284), suggesting that the SWI images are more suitable for SN segmentation.

In addition, the feature of RF (Random Forest) in generating a large number of classes to classify effectively is a factor to be considered. The proposed model was tested on five stages of PD, improving accuracy by 92%. The accuracy probability is given from 85%-95%, and the recall probability is 87% to 93 %. The proposed extensive dataset metadata that combined several medical imaging and physiological measures from patients with PD, provide a controlled and precise testing. Model performance is then analyzed by using different measures such as precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, different visualizing tools, such as confusion matrix and ROC curves were leveraged. The ROC curves produced relatively high areas under the curve with values ranging from 0. 88 to 0. 97 in different phases.

A dataset of 40 audio samples from PD patients and 41 from healthy individuals is labeled as 0 (healthy person) and 1(diseased person). Speech features are extracted from the voice recordings using MelFrequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). These extracted features are then passed into a Random Forest classifier, which is trained to predict whether the person has Parkinson's Disease or not by using the audio as an input. The model is evaluated based on accuracy and precision metrics. By taking voice as input and predicting whether the person had the disease or not, this method offers an efficient and objective tool for early diagnosis.

This degeneration is expressed through motor symptoms like tremors, bradykinesia (movement reduction), rigidity, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms like cognitive impairment, depression, and sleep disturbances. The impact of PD on those affected is considerable, often leading to a notable decline in quality of life, diminished independence, and heightened healthcare costs. Although therapeutic approaches like dopamine replacement therapy, deep brain stimulation, and rehabilitation can alleviate symptoms, identifying a conclusive treatment for PD remains a challenging endeavor. Accurate and careful analysis is essential for effective treatment planning and for slowing down the disease's progression. Fuzzy logic, which addresses uncertainty and vague information, can predict PD by examining the severity of symptoms and patient information. By combining quantum computing with advanced data analysis, we can significantly improve the way we process and understand complex medical data. This breakthrough enables us to make more accurate predictions about the progression of diseases, such as Parkinson's, and even offers the potential for personalized treatment recommendations. By harnessing the power of quantum computing, can tap into the intricate patterns hidden within neurological signals, ultimately leading to more effective treatments for patients with Parkinson's and other conditions.

To overcome the limitations of single-feature or traditional machine learning methods in accuracy and stability, the study utilizes a non-invasive approach that integrates individual patient information with multimodal speech feature optimization strategies. Using a publicly available Parkinson's speech dataset consisting of 756 samples and 755 -dimensional features, a three-stage feature selection method-comprising patient ID grouping with mean aggregation, dual correlation filtering, and chi-square testing-was employed to reduce the feature space to 31 key dimensions. Data preprocessing using MinMaxScaler and PCA further enhanced the training efficiency by mitigating feature magnitude differences and redundancy. The model was developed by integrating logistic regression, XGBoost, and support vector machine classifiers, with a RandomOverSampler applied to address the imbalance between healthy and patient samples. Experimental results demonstrated that the logistic regression model achieved the best overall performance, attaining an accuracy of 88% on the validation set and outperforming other models in terms of AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall.

Our pipeline uses an Ada Boost model for classification on a challenging early stage PD classification task with with only 30 participants (11 PD, 19 Healthy Control). Evaluating 9 brain connectivity metrics we find the best connectivity metric to be different for each arousal state with Phase Lag Index achieving the highest in-dividual classification accuracy of 86% on N1 data. Further to this our pipeline using regional signal statistics achieves an accuracy of 78%, using brain connectivity only achieves an accuracy of 86% whereas combining the two achieves a best accuracy of 91%. This best performance is achieved on N1 data using Phase Lag Index (PLI) combined with statistics derived from the frequency characteristics of the EEG signal. This model also achieves a recall of 80 % and precision of 96%. Furthermore we find that o n data from each arousal state, combining PLI with regional signal statistics improves classification accuracy versus using signal statistics or brain connectivity alone. Thus we conclude that combining brain connectivity statistics with regional EEG statistics is optimal for classifier performance on early stage Parkinson's. Additionally, we find outperformance of N1 EEG for classification of Parkinson's and expect this could be due to disrupted N1 sleep in PD.

There were found no differences in the body oscillation variables on the AP and ML axis. There was a difference in CoP displacement and oscillation speed between stage 1.5 to 3.0. It was concluded that participants with PD in stage 3.0 had greater distances from the CoP and greater speed of body sway, and that these instabilities become more evident with the progression of the disease.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629598","","Training;Neurological diseases;Protocols;Parkinson's disease;Evolution (biology);Interference;Oscillators","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Postural Balance;Posture","7","","18","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It causes some or all loss of the ability to move, speak, behave, think, and perform other essential tasks. Monitoring the patient's condition on a frequent basis is one of the essential elements of a successful treatment. In order to track the evolution of a condition, physiological analysis results are translated to a metric, the Universal Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). It is a scoring system that measures the existence and severity of the symptoms. It ranges from 0-176 for patients who are not receiving treatment, with 0 denoting a healthy condition and 176 denoting entire disability. It is divided into three categories: motor activities, everyday living activities, and thought, behavior, and mood. The motor UPDRS measures the functions including speech, facial expression, stiffness, and tremor on a scale of 0 to 108, with 0 signifying normal status and 108 denoting significant movement disorders. Speech spans from 0 to 8, where 8 indicates incoherent speech. Nowadays, in health care environments, noninvasive tele-monitoring is a growing alternative that may allow for reliable, affordable disease screening and relieving the strain of frequent, clinic visits. As a result, the burden on the costs is reduced, and the clinical evaluation of the subject's condition is evaluated more accurately. The information acquired from the patients can be utilized to accurately anticipate how severe a patient's PD symptoms will be. The proposed study uses a variety of models such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boost and xgboost with parameter optimization for maximizing the prediction accuracy. The random forest model has the highest R2 value and the lowest RMSE.We also investigate the relationship between the two dependent target variables, total UPDRS and motor UPDRS. The two dependent target variables were found to have a 0.947 correlation coefficient.

Clinical evaluation typically involves tools like the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), but such assessments have drawbacks, including their subjective nature and dependence on the expertise of the examiner. To address this, the study aimed to objectively measure rigidity using RehaBEElitation, a bee-themed serious game. This game was managed by a wearable device that features inertial and resistive light sensors The device was built using the Esp8266 microcontroller, which combines an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, each with three axes capable of sensing hand orientation. Resistive light sensors detect the opening and closing of the hands and fingers. The device is lightweight, comfortable to use, prioritises hygiene, and is ergonomically designed. Data were collected from 5 healthy male participants and 5 PD subjects in the “on” and “off” states of medication, paired by age and gender. The participants played Phase 4 of the game for 5 minutes, or until they had completed all of the targets. The highest value of Power Spectral Density (PSD) was determined and associated with the MDS-UPDRS scale. Statistical tests were used to determine differences between groups (PD “off” vs. PD “on” vs. healthy). For all sensors and axes, the PD “off” group had the smallest power amplitude at the PSD-measured frequencies, followed by the PD “on” group and then the healthy group. On most axes, there were significant correlations between the MDS-UPDRS scores and the sensors. According to the findings, people with PD had larger impairments in muscle activity and coordination than the healthy group, indicating more rigidity.","2995-0589","979-8-3503-7720-0","10.1109/ICECS61496.2024.10848823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10848823","Parkinson's disease;rigidity;objective evaluation;wearable device","Support vector machines;Hands;Parkinson's disease;Magnetic sensors;Games;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensors;Rigidity;Wearable devices;Wearable sensors","","","","17","IEEE","28 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Neuroimaging techniques like MRI, PET, and SPECT provide insights into brain abnormalities but are expensive and require specialist interpretation. Machine learning approaches, including algorithms like SVM, DNN, and random forests, show promise in detecting subtle changes indicative of PD onset, especially when combined with wearable technologies. These methods face challenges such as overfitting, generalization, and interpretability. The paper compares the methods based on accuracy, cost, and practicality, aiming to guide future research and development in PD early detection.

Locomotor profiles of all of the muscles tested were found to be substantially affected by STN stimulation, either in terms of restoration/enhancement of the main activity bursts or normalization of recruitment timing thereof. Responses showed relatively higher statistical significance in the distal groups (GAM and TA) and, within them, for the EMG components called into action over the ground-contact (ankle dorsiflexors) and midstance (ankle plantarflexors) phases of the stride cycle. In line with data obtained from clinical rating, unilateral stimulation produced less consistent EMG changes compared with bilateral stimulation. However, at variance with clinical effects, which prevailed on the side of the body contralateral to stimulation, EMG responses to unilateral stimulation were usually symmetrical. Results indicate that the impact of STN stimulation on locomotor activation of lower limb muscles in PD is characterized by: 1) substantial effects exhibiting differential topographical (distal versus proximal) and stride-phase (stance versus swing) consistency and 2) absence of the lateralized actions typically observed for the clinical signs of the disease.

In particular, the loss of dopaminergic neurons compromises the speed, the automaticity and fluidity of movements. As the disease evolves, PD patient's motion becomes slower and tremoric and the response to medication fluctuates along the day. In addition, the presence of involuntary movements deteriorates voluntary movement in advanced state of the disease. These changes in the motion can be detected by studying the variation of the signals recorded by accelerometers attached in the limbs and belt of the patients. The analysis of the most significant changes in these signals make possible to build an individualized motor profile of the disease, allowing doctors to personalize the medication intakes and consequently improving the response of the patient to the treatment. Several works have been done in a laboratory and supervised environments providing solid results; this work focused on the design of unsupervised method for the assessment of gait in PD patients.

However, there is a lack of objective methods for quantifying the efficacy of treatment in PD. We applied here an objective method for quantifying the effects of medication in PD using EMG and acceleration measurements and analysis. In the method, four signal features were calculated from the EMG and acceleration recordings of both sides of the body: the kurtosis and recurrence rate of EMG, and the amplitude and sample entropy of acceleration. Principal component approach was used for reducing the number of variables. EMG and acceleration data measured from nine PD patients were used for analysis. The patients were measured in four different medication conditions: with medication off, and two and three and four hours after taking the medication. The results showed that in eight patients the EMG recordings changed into less spiky and the acceleration recordings into more complex after taking the medication. A reverse phenomenon in the signal characteristics was observed in seven patients 3-4 hours after taking the medication. The results indicate that the presented method is potentially useful for quantifying objectively the effects of medication on the neuromuscular function in PD.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091848","","Medical diagnostic imaging;Electromyography;Acceleration;Parkinson's disease;Vectors;Educational institutions;Entropy","Acceleration;Aged;Electromyography;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Activity;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Principal Component Analysis;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","","","14","IEEE","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Twenty PD and 20 control subjects, wearing an accelerometer on the lower back, were tested in five conditions characterized by sensory and attentional perturbation. A total of 175 measures were computed from the signals to quantify tremor, acceleration, and displacement of body sway. Feature selection was implemented to identify the subsets of measures that better characterize the distinctive behavior of PD and control subjects. It was based on different classifiers and on a nested cross validation, to maximize robustness of selection with respect to changes in the training set. Several subsets of three features achieved misclassification rates as low as 5%. Many of them included a tremor-related measure, a postural measure in the frequency domain, and a postural displacement measure. Results suggest that quantitative posture analysis using a single accelerometer and a simple test protocol may provide useful information to characterize early PD subjects.

The progression rate and manifestation of PD is highly heterogenous, and the underlying etiology for this heterogeneity remains elusive. Although some studies have identified risk genes associated with the development of PD, it is unknown whether the patient genome influences the progression pattern of PD in any way. In this study, we used the whole-exome sequencing data of PD patients from the Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) to examine whether an individual's genetic profile is associated with their progression pattern of PD. We used the three distinct progression subtypes defined by Zhang et al. as the outcome variable, and trained logistic regression and support vector classifiers. Our best performing model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 on the test set, indicating that the genetic profile of a PD patient appears to have some relationship with their likely disease course. We then interpreted our trained model by performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis on the sets of genes with high model coefficients for each progression subtype. The results showed enrichment for genes related to olfactory signaling in Subtype I and III, and an enrichment for genes related to protein glycosylation and glycation for Subtype I and II. Overall, our findings suggests a connection between an individual's genetic profile and PD progression subtype, and calls for controlled research studies to further examine the relationship between the implicated gene sets and each progression subtype.","","978-1-7281-6215-7","10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313376","Parkinson’s Disease;progression subtype;machine learning;germline variants;genetic profile","Diseases;Olfactory;Bioinformatics;Support vector machines;Genomics;Predictive models;Sequential analysis","","1","","17","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the automation in early detection of PD is an important issue. In the literature, different classification methods have been proposed. Also, due to the high dimension of extracted features of voice, many feature selection algorithms have been developed.

It induces a progressive necrosis of dopaminergic (i.e., releasing dopamine, a neurotransmitter) cells and, as a consequence, produces altered information patterns along movement-related ganglia-mediated pathways in the brain, thus inducing motor disorders like tremor at rest and postural instability. While pharmacological and electrical therapies are currently available for PD treatment, the mechanisms according to which such disease operates are still partly unclear, due to the lack of knowledge about the basal ganglia role in motor tasks execution. For that reason, in order to shed some light on the inner dynamics of the basal ganglia and investigate how PD alters their electric patterns, we develop a two-stages modeling study: in the present paper we focus on those nuclei involved in the genesis of PD motor symptoms and, for them, develop a conductance-based electrical model able to mimic quantitative data from different in vitro physiological analyses. Such models show how several highly nonlinear electrical behaviors can stem from the interaction between specific ionic currents as particular parameters change. In (S. Santaniello et al., 2007), then, cellular models are inserted in a network scheme to reproduce the main actual anatomical connections and the resulting macroscopic behaviors reported in literature for normal and Parkinsonian conditions.","2378-5861","1-4244-0988-8","10.1109/ACC.2007.4282741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4282741","Neuronal Modeling;Basal Ganglia;Deep Brain Stimulation;Parkinson's Disease;Nonlinear Systems","Basal ganglia;Parkinson's disease;Neurons;Pathology;Nervous system;Neurotransmitters;Medical treatment;In vitro;Pattern analysis;Cellular networks","","14","","23","IEEE","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We call signals of this type as wave trains; a wave train (a wave packet) is an electrical signal that is localized in space, frequency, and time. Examples of wave trains in EEG are alpha, beta, and sleep spindles. We analyze any kinds of wave train electrical activity of the brain in a wide frequency range. We have developed a new method for analyzing wave train electrical activity of the cerebral cortex based on wavelet analysis and ROC analysis that enables to study the detailed time-frequency features of EEG in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The idea of the method is to find local maxima in a wavelet spectrogram and to calculate various characteristics describing these maxima (called wave trains): the leading frequency, the duration (the full-width on the half-maximum of the peak in the spectrogram, FWHM), the bandwidth (FWHM), the number of wave trains per second. Then we conduct statistical analysis of these characteristics. In our previous papers, frequency ranges were found where the quantity of wave trains per second differs between a group of patients in early stage of PD and a group of healthy volunteers. In this paper, the specificity of these PD features is investigated in comparison with the patients with essential tremor (ET).","","978-1-5386-4283-2","10.1109/SITIS.2017.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8334742","Wavelet spectrogram;ROC analysis;Wave train;PCA;Brain electrical activity;Signal processing;EEG;Parkinson's disease;Essential tremor","Electroencephalography;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Wavelet analysis;Spectrogram;Parkinson's disease","","9","","24","IEEE","12 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some of the recent works pointed out that artificial intelligence technique has been successfully applied to assess the disease at different stage using the gait features as well as speech related features. So in this paper an attempt has been made to distinguish PD group from the healthy control group based on voice recordings with selected features and different classification techniques such as linear classifiers, nonlinear classifiers and Probabilistic classifiers. We have used recursive feature elimination algorithm (RFE) for selection of important features. We have implemented above mentioned classification technique and found an accuracy of 97.37%, and sensitivity of 100% with linear classifier (SVM) compared with the other classifier. We have also compare the other performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive by implementing the classification techniques.

In the study of patients with PD, it is very difficult to find untreated patients who have not previously taken antiparkinsonian drugs. To solve the problem of small samples, it was proposed to increase artificially the sample of subjects using the bootstrap method. Three artificially enlarged samples of subjects were created: a sample of patients with PD, a sample of patients with ET, and a sample of control subjects. When constructing models, two problems arise: the problem of inadequacy and the problem of insufficient generalizing ability of the model. Both of these issues must be considered when building models. The paper proposes models that, according to the authors, are promising for the early and differential diagnosis of PD and ET.

The feature extraction and de-noising of input data are performed using an autoencoder. CNN is used for classification and prediction. This algorithm has three layers: a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a dense layer. Feature extraction and image segmentation are automatically performed in the convolutional layer.

It causes thoughts to arise in the mind, produces responses, and makes it possible for body parts to move. It further controls additional functions, including digestion and breathing. This nervous system is made up of billions of cells that can translate the information received by sensory organs into actions carried out by body parts. However, as we get older, these cells begin to die, which causes the amount of the dopamine compound to decrease. This causes unexpected progression in the movement of the body parts, which is known as Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the disease is very challenging to cure but its production can be decelerated with early prediction. In this work, five machine learning models namely, random forest, decision tree, linear regression, naive bayes, and logistic regression have been used for the early PD diagnosis. For the implementation of the model, the dataset has been collected from Kaggle containing the normal cases and PD patients. The results have depicted that random forest models outperform with an accuracy rate of 86.24%, however, the naive shows the least accuracy value of 73.94%. Furthermore, the work can be helpful in diagnosing the active cases of PD in real-time medical treatment if enabled by the healthcare departments.

The field potentials and their firing pattern in response to whole body tilt stimuli from both left and right ears were extracted. We investigated several statistical and fractal features of the field potentials and also their firing patterns. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to select the features showing the most significant differences between individuals with PD and the age-matched controls. Linear Discriminant analysis classification was applied to every selected feature using a leave-one-out routine. The result of each feature's classifier was used in a heuristic weighted average voting system to diagnose PD patients. The weights of the voting system were the (posterior) probabilities calculated by the designed classifier to indicate a subject related to a specific class. The results show more than 97% accuracy for PD diagnosis. Given that the patients were at different stage of disease, the high accuracy of the results encourages the use of vestibular response for PD diagnosis as a plausible quick and non-invasive screening tool.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346771","","Firing;Feature extraction;Fractals;Diseases;Ear;Accuracy;Medical diagnostic imaging","Action Potentials;Aged;Case-Control Studies;Female;Fractals;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors;Vestibule, Labyrinth","3","","21","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the unique learning model (ULM) used for hand drawings to detect PD; a dataset would need to be collected containing drawings from both people with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. The dataset should be large enough to ensure that the machine learning algorithm can accurately distinguish between the two groups. Once the dataset is collected, a machine learning algorithm can be trained to classify the drawings as either Parkinson's or healthy. The machine learning algorithm would need to be trained on the dataset using features extracted from the hand drawings, such as the size and shape of certain parts of the drawing, the angle of the lines, and the smoothness of the lines. These features would be used to create a model that can accurately distinguish between Parkinson's and healthy hand drawings. The performance of the model analyzed by a separate testing dataset would be used, containing hand drawings from both groups. The model would be evaluated on this dataset to determine its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics can be used to assess how well the model is able to distinguish between Parkinson's and healthy hand drawings. Overall, using ULM to detect PD from dataset has the potential to be a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible method for early detection of the disease.","","979-8-3503-0085-7","10.1109/ICSSAS57918.2023.10331854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10331854","Parkinson's disease;unique learning model (ULM);support vector machines (SVMs);random forests;neural networks (NN)","Support vector machines;Measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Shape;Medical services;Predictive models","","1","","18","IEEE","6 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate rapid, remote replication of UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 7.5 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates), using only simple, self-administered, and noninvasive speech tests. We characterize speech with signal processing algorithms, extracting clinically useful features of average PD progression. Subsequently, we select the most parsimonious model with a robust feature selection algorithm, and statistically map the selected subset of features to UPDRS using linear and nonlinear regression techniques that include classical least squares and nonparametric classification and regression trees. We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (~6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multicenter trial).

The proposed PDC-based information flow analysis demonstrated distinctly altered patterns of connectivity between PD patients off medication and healthy subjects, particularly with respect to net information outflow from the left sensorimotor (L Sm) region, which might indicate excessive spreading of activity in the diseased state. Disrupted patterns of connectivity in PD were partially restored by levodopa medication. In addition, PDC-based analysis proved to be more sensitive to temporally-dynamic connectivity changes as compared to traditional spectral analysis, which might be influenced primarily by large-scale changes.

Walking periods were recognized using two sensors on shanks and lying periods were detected using a sensor on trunk. By calculating kinematics features of the trunk movements during the transitions between sitting and standing postures and using a statistical classifier, sit-to-stand (SiSt) and stand-to-sit (StSi) transitions were detected and separated from other body movements. Finally, a fuzzy classifier used this information to detect periods of sitting and standing. The proposed method showed a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of basic body postures allocations: sitting, standing, lying, and walking periods, both in PD patients and healthy subjects. We found significant differences in parameters related to SiSt and StSi transitions between PD patients and controls and also between PD patients with and without STN-DBS turned on.

In this work, the freezing of gait (FoG) from subjects with Parkinson disease has been detected by the logistic regression modeling. To complete this work, first, the acceleration sensor has been placed on the ankle of the patients to get the signals. Second, the features from these acceleration signals have been extracted by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. With the FFT algorithm, the frequency coefficients have been gotten. To diminish the number of features, the statistical measures including variance, maximum amplitude, minimum amplitude, maximum energy, and minimum energy, have been applied to frequency coefficients of these signals. So, for each class (FoG and no- FoG), five parameters have been extracted. Eight patients are having Parkinson disease in the dataset. After feature extraction, the logistic regression modeling has been used to detect the freezing of gait cases from the dataset. The classification of the accuracy of 81.3% has been achieved in the classification of FoG cases having PD from the acceleration signals. In addition to logistic regression, four different classifiers (Linear SVM, Quadratic SVM, Cubic SVM, and kNN) have been used to classify the FoG cases.

It is particularly important to study an objective and fast tremor assessment method to assist doctors in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this paper, a recognition system of Parkinson's patients' hand function tremor based on machine learning is designed. Firstly, the acceleration sensor is used to collect the hand tremor signal, and then the median and band-pass filters are used to remove the noise. Next, the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the tremors signal are extracted. Finally, BP neural network algorithm is used to classify the tremor degree into three categories. 12 volunteers were selected to carry out the system function experiment, and the results show that the system can achieve the classification of hand tremors, with an accuracy rate of 84.5%.

The two most common neurodegenerative illnesses are Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, in which majority of people with PD are elderly, since it is a common central nervous system condition. The Clinical diagnosis of the ailment is difficult due to the difficult signs of the sickness. Additionally, it is anticipated to rise over the next ten years, driving up treatment costs. The significance of medical outcomes on patients' financial investments leads to bias, errors, and high clinical expenditures. Precise planning of a treatment is necessary to lower the possibility of a consequence that cannot be retrieved. In this work, the ensemble classifiers are utilized to back up the specialists' diagnosis of PD. Using boosting and bagging algorithm, a collection of classifiers is created, and the classifiers' predictions are then used to categorize new data. The dataset for this study comprises of a variety of biological speech signals from 31 people, including 8 healthy subjects and 23 people with Parkinson's disease. The UCI machine learning (ML) database was used to compile a set of data about Parkinson's disease. The performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of the device include accuracy (ACC), true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), positive prediction value (PPV), negative prediction value (NPV), false positive rate (FPR), and false negative rate (FNR).

Within this framework, we introduce an innovative system for Parkinson’s disease detection, which encompasses several key stages. The process commences with data augmentation and preprocessing, subsequently leading to the segmentation of online handwriting into Beta strokes. Following that, feature extraction is carried out utilizing the Beta-elliptical approach and the fuzzy perceptual detector.

Specifically, we used triaxial gyroscopes and adaptive filters to quantify how predictable and regular the signals were. We found that simply using the normalized mean squared error (NMSE) as a test statistic permitted us to distinguish between subjects with and without Parkinson's disease who were matched for age, height, and weight. A forward linear predictor based on the Kalman filter was able to attain areas under the curve (AUC) in receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves in the range of 0.76 to 0.83.

Motion capture systems, on the other hand, can potentially provide more objective and quantitative assessments. In this pilot study, we perform full-body motion capture of Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulator off-drugs and with stimulators on and off. Our experimental results indicate that the quantitative measure on spatio-temporal statistics learnt from the motion capture data reveal distinctive differences between mild and severe symptoms. We used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for discriminating mild vs. severe symptoms with an average accuracy of approximately 90%.

Wearable cardiovascular sensing holds promise for improving detection and management of OH. In this study, participants with PD ($\mathrm{n}=6, 3$ with OH) underwent an orthostatic challenge wearing a chest patch capturing electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals alongside reference beat-to-beat BP. From supine to standing, PPG amplitude decreased significantly more ($\mathrm{p} < 0.05$) in the PD+OH group compared to the PD group. Further, the change in PPG amplitude was significantly correlated ($\mathrm{r}=0.83,\ \mathrm{p} < 0.05$) to the change in pulse pressure (PP) during the orthostatic challenge. These findings suggest that sternal PPG amplitude is a potential discriminative marker of OH and may enable noninvasive detection of OH episodes, allowing for earlier diagnoses and more optimal management of cardiovascular autonomic health.","2168-9229","979-8-3503-0387-2","10.1109/SENSORS56945.2023.10324998","American Parkinson Disease Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10324998","Parkinson's disease;wearable sensing;orthostatic hypotension;photoplethysmography;cardiac sensing","Pathology;Parkinson's disease;Baroreflex;Electrocardiography;Photoplethysmography;Regulation;Biomedical monitoring","","2","","25","IEEE","28 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A quantitative evaluation method of facial expression behavior based on facial action units is proposed. A differential diagnosis model for Parkinson's disease is established. The validity of recognition model is verified.The severity of Hypomimia symptoms is graded. The relationship between facial expression disorder and disease grade in patients is explored. The accuracy of the optimal threshold value of the logistic regression classifier is 90.06%.The results have practical significance and application value for objective diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.","","978-1-6654-2877-4","10.1109/ICIBA52610.2021.9688135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9688135","facial action unit;Parkinson's disease;Hypomimia;logistic regression algorithm;machine learning;feature selection;model construction;diagnosis model of Parkinson's disease","Image coding;Parkinson's disease;Conferences;Machine learning;Big Data;Data models;Classification algorithms","","14","","15","IEEE","3 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Patients often report visual impairments and exhibit deficits of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and color vision, suggesting abnormal processing of visual information. Although electrophysiological studies indicate amplitude and latency differences in patients, one of the major challenges is the lack of a conclusive, accurate, non-invasive biomarker for diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we used machine learning to model and identify the most relevant signs from the EEG spectra over the span of visual stimulation. First, we used human electroencephalography (EEG) to measure visual evoked responses during steady state (ssVEP) in a visual surround suppression paradigm, in which measures of gain control and temporal aspects of the visual response are simultaneously tracked. We found an excessive response gain profile of the contrast response function, and an abnormally greater background noise level in PD patients compared to healthy controls. Second, performance of three learning models was tested: logistic regression, decision tree and extra tree. Together, these provide powerful insights about the most relevant features that allow classifying patients from controls. These models contribute with new hints on the interpretation of functional abnormalities in PD based on spectral EEG during visual stimulation. Machine learning provides a promising tool for accurate and robust prediction in PD diagnosis, based on EEG signatures during visual information processing.","","978-1-5386-5488-0","10.1109/BIBM.2018.8621498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8621498","machine learning, Parkinson’s disease, classification, artificial intelligence, electroencephalography (EEG), biomarker, steady state visual evoked potential (ssVEP), vision, frequency spectrum, visual pathway","Visualization;Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Logistics;Regression tree analysis;Machine learning","","37","","14","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, automatic classification of Parkinson's disease by using structural magnetic resonance imaging have been investigated. Voxel-based morphometry technique is used to compare the local and global differences of each grey matter and white matter with Parkinson's disease versus healthy controls. The differences are considered as volumes of interests. VBM is used with DARTEL in order to increase inter-group registration, provide more precise, and accurate localization of structural differences of sMRI data. In order to generate 3D masks both for gray as well as white matter modalities, the general linear models are configured and two sample t-test based statistical method is used. Principle component analysis and probability distribution function based feature selection methods are used to select the volumes of interest. Support vector machine with Gaussian kernel is taken into account for classification of 40 Parkinson's disease patients and 40 healthy controls. The experiments are investigated to compare the performances of two methods with original and raw data for white and gray matter modalities. Since the number of voxels in obtained clusters are a few, some of which may be counted as noise and hence amount of extracted features are not extremely high, using principle component analysis for 3D mask data gives better results than probability distribution function based feature selection methods. It removes unimportant voxels, whereas histogram technique uses their impacts.","","978-1-5386-1501-0","10.1109/SIU.2018.8404697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8404697","Parkinson's disease;PCA;PDF;SPM12;CAT12;DARTEL","Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Probability density function;Parkinson's disease","","14","","13","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems are generally based on measuring the motor system disorders seen in PD patients by the help of non-invasive data collection tools. Vocal impairments one of the most commonly seen PD symptoms in the early stages of the disease, and building such telemonitoring systems based on detecting the level of vocal impairments results in reliable motor UPDRS tracking systems. In this paper, we aim to determine the optimal UPDRS threshold value that can be discriminated by the vocal features extracted from the sustained vowel phonations of PD patients. For this purpose, we used an online available PD telemonitoring dataset consisting of speech recordings of 42 PD patients. We converted the UPDRS prediction problem into a binary classification problem for various motor UPDRS threshold values, and fed the features to k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines classifiers to discriminate the PD patients whose UPDRS is less than or greater than the specified threshold value. The results indicate that speech disorders are more significantly seen in the patients whose UPDRS exceeds the experimentally determined threshold value (15). Besides, considering that the motor UPDRS ranges from 0 to 108, relatively low UPDRS threshold of 15 validates that vocal impairments can be used as early indicators of the disease.","","978-1-4673-7983-0","10.1109/BIBE.2015.7367737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7367737","","Support vector machines;Parkinson's disease;Speech;Feature extraction;Measurement;Training","","9","","15","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Six patients (age 46-75) with diagnosis of idiopathic PD and levodopa-related motor fluctuations were studied. Subjects performed motor tasks in a ""practically-defined OFF"" state, and then at 30 minute intervals after medication intake. At each interval, data from 8 uniaxial accelerometers on the upper and lower limbs were recorded continuously, and subjects were videotaped. Features representing motion characteristics such as intensity, rate, regularity, and coordination were derived from the sensor data, and clinical scores were assigned for each task by review of the videotapes. Cluster analysis was performed on feature sets that were expected to reflect severity of parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. bradykinesia) and motor complications (e.g. dyskinesias).

The device provided resisting force during the tasks, and a VR headset enhanced the game experience, making it more engaging and immersive. We examined the usability and efficacy of the VR game system with haptic feedback for upper-limb rehabilitation by collecting data from healthy and PD participants. Participants were asked to complete predefined task sessions and provide workload ratings using a NASA Task Load Index. Participants’ skills and efficacy were also quantitatively assessed using task specific data. Haptic feedback, which controlled resistance, influenced user performance in movement trajectory, completion time, and task score significantly. These results are helpful in the development of personalized rehabilitation in this population.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782316","haptic feedback;virtual reality;games;upper-limb rehabilitation;Parkinson’s Disease","Performance evaluation;Three-dimensional displays;NASA;Games;Virtual reality;Motors;Haptic interfaces;Trajectory;Usability;Diseases","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Virtual Reality;Upper Extremity;Male;Female;Middle Aged;Video Games;Aged;Feedback","2","","16","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an early manifestation of PD, PD-related depression is hard to diagnose, thereby contributing to morbidity. Recent endeavors have employed deep learning networks to assist in the diagnosis of PD and depression, achieving commendable levels of accuracy. However, little attention has been directed toward PD-related depression, and the decision process of the network lacks transparency and explainability. What has been learned by the network and whether pathological mechanisms contribute to the classifier’s result remain mysterious. In this study, we propose an explainable functional connectivity framework to recognize depression in PD. Specifically, the diagnosis feature extraction module learns high-dimensional information from functional connectivity features, followed by the diagnosis module making decisions. Furthermore, the explainable module provides interpretation and validation for the decisions on functional connectivity. Evaluation of the dataset demonstrates superb subject-wise predictive performance and provides visual evidence of the underlying pathology in EEG. The interpretation results bridge the gap between pathophysiological mechanisms and computer-aided diagnosis.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782333","explainable;Parkinson’s disease;depression;interpretable deep learning;electroencephalography","Knowledge engineering;Deep learning;Pathology;Visualization;Depression;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Computer aided diagnosis;Engineering in medicine and biology;Diseases","Parkinson Disease;Humans;Electroencephalography;Depression;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Algorithms","1","","19","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this study is to examine whether LIPUS stimulation of the motor cortex can improve parkinsonian motor deficit in a mouse model induced by 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Methods: Acute Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model is built by injection of MPTP (20 mg/kg) every 4 h in a total of four doses in one day. Mice are randomized into control, MPTP, sham-LIPUS+MPTP, and LIPUS+MPTP group. For LIPUS+MPTP group, 7 days of LIPUS (800 kHz, 10% duty cycle, 100-Hz pulse repetition frequency, 40 min/day) is delivered to the motor cortex. An open field test (OFT) is conducted on day 4 and a pole test on day 5, respectively. Striatal total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) are measured on day 8. The safety of LIPUS is verified using Hematoxylin and esosin (HE) staining and Nissl staining. Results: LIPUS treatment improves rearing number in the OFT on day 4 $(n= 8, p= 0.037)$ and locomotor activity in the pole test on day 5 $(n= 8, p= 0.007)$ compared with the sham-LIPUS+MPTP group. Moreover, LIPUS increases T-SOD $(n= 7, p= 0.006)$ and GSH-PX $(n= 7, p= 0.030)$ compared with the sham-LIPUS+MPTP group. In addition, HE and Nissl staining shows no brain tissue injury induced by LIPUS. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that LIPUS may have neuromodulation effects in PD mice.

Emotion affects blood pressure, heart rate, kidney function, and a few disorders of the nervous system. Parkinson's disease, which causes impairment of movement, is one of the brain disorders. This issue is caused by a reduction in dopamine release in the cortex of the brain. Dopamine production deviations have been related to essential hypertension. Dopamine has a crucial role in anxiety modulation in multiple regions of the brain. Patients with Parkinson's disease frequently indicate that acute stress worsens their motor symptoms, especially gait freezing, dyskinesia, and tremors and the emotions play a substantial role in Parkinson's disease.

This article briefly outlines the research on postural control in elderly adults and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkinson's disease may be considered a form of accelerated aging, and as such, many of the abnormal postural control characteristics found in the elderly are observed and magnified in PD patients. The symptoms contributing to impaired postural control include the amplitude of body sway, delayed sensory and response processing, as well as prolonged, reduced, and inflexible responses to perturbations. In general, the research suggests that although aging and PD contribute to changes in postural control, some symptoms are not inherent to age or disease but can be modified through the health and physical fitness of the person.","1937-4186","","10.1109/MEMB.2003.1195692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1195692","","Aging;Parkinson's disease;Senior citizens;Muscles;Delay;Stability;Hip;Control systems;Timing;Force control","Accidental Falls;Adaptation, Physiological;Aged;Aging;Feedback;Homeostasis;Humans;Movement;Muscle, Skeletal;Parkinson Disease;Posture;Stress, Mechanical","39","","48","IEEE","22 Apr 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The Pull Test is the most common clinical examination to assess postural instability in PD. However, the subjectivity and low discriminative power of this test presents as a major drawback. In this paper we propose a novel methodology to estimate the Pull Test scores from patients with PD. We capture the relationship between the Pull Test outcomes and patients' foot motion patterns, using wearable sensors mounted on their shoes. 139 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients performed four motor function tests, including walking and repetitive foot motions, while acceleration and orientation data was recorded. A total of 684 features were extracted from the acceleration and orientation signals. Feature selection and classification algorithms were utilized to estimate the Pull Test score for each participant. Further, we estimate which motor function test would better predict the Pull Test score, depending on the patient's phenotype (i.e. bradykinetic, tremor-dominant or equivalent). When combining all phenotypes and all tests, the mean of the classification probability distribution achieved was 0.75 (CI: [0.69 – 0.82]). Foot circling was the best predictive test for the equivalent patients (mean = 0.79, CI: [0.69 – 0.87]) and the bradykinetic patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64 – 0.85]), while 2×10 m. walk with stop-and-go proved superior for the tremor-dominant patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64 – 0.85]).

Gait disorders, such as foot shuffling, are common symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and can affect the estimation of gait parameters, such as stance and swing durations. To avoid the influence of such gait deviations on measured gait parameters, it is important to detect their occurrence and duration. This study proposes a smart insole-based method using pressure sensors and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for the continuous detection of foot shuffling steps and the estimation of the duration of shuffling activity within a step cycle. A total of 536 walking steps were obtained from 10 participants to classify foot shuffling steps from normal walking steps. The proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 97.8% when validated using a k-fold cross-validation approach. Accelerometer and pressure data were employed to estimate the duration of each shuffling step, achieving a root mean squared error of 0.018 seconds when compared to a ground truth obtained from an optical motion capture system. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no existing method for estimating the duration of foot shuffling within a step cycle. These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to continuously detect the occurrence and duration of foot shuffling in a free-living environment and contribute to improved gait analysis for the diagnosis and treatment assessment of individuals with Parkinson’s disease.","2376-8894","979-8-3503-3841-6","10.1109/BSN58485.2023.10331076","University of New Hampshire; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10331076","foot shuffling;smart insole;pressure sensors;inertial measurement units;Parkinson’s disease","Legged locomotion;Pressure sensors;Measurement units;Parkinson's disease;Estimation;Inertial navigation;Optical network units;Motion capture;Optical sensors;Foot","","3","","17","IEEE","1 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After extracting highly relevant features, we apply anomaly detection techniques to detect FoG events. Specifically, feature selection is performed using correlation and clusterability metrics. From a list of 244 feature candidates, 36 candidates were selected using saliency and robustness criteria. We develop an anomaly score detector with adaptive thresholding to identify FoG events. Then, using accuracy metrics, we reduce the feature list to seven candidates. Our novel multichannel freezing index was the most selective across all window sizes, achieving sensitivity (specificity) of 96% (79%). On the other hand, freezing index from the vertical axis was the best choice for a single input, achieving sensitivity (specificity) of 94% (84%) for ankle and 89% (94%) for back sensors.

In this research, we classify the neurological state of the patients with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) according to the third section of the Movement Disorders Society - Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) using multimodal bio-signal data. As PD advances from low to advanced state, PwPD finds it difficult in their speech production and irregularities in their gait patterns. Monitoring the chaotic nature of time series data corresponding to speech and gait biomarkers can provide insights into the progression of the condition across different stages. This work for the first time analyze PD in a complex system perspective while representing the biomarkers as complex networks. The time-series corresponding to speech and gait signals are represented separately, as a complex network using the visibility graph algorithm. The characterization of the different stages of PD is explored for each modalities using different network features. Performance evaluation shows that the results obtained using the multimodal configuration of speech and gait left foot signals outperform the state-of the-art method. Moreover, performance comparison with the unimodal counterparts proves the need for multimodal assessment of PD severity. The configuration ‘speech and gait left foot’ outperforms (in terms of accuracy) that of the unimodal by 32% in speech, 3% in gait left foot, 19% in gait right foot, and 3% in gait both feet.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3416444","Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (AMRITA) Seed(grant numbers:ASG2022118); Comité para el Desarrollo de la Investigación (CODI) at Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA)(grant numbers:PI2023-58010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10562297","Complex network;complex systems;gait signal;graph;multi-modal data;network features;Parkinson’s disease;speech signal;visibility network","Task analysis;Motors;Feature extraction;Complex systems;Accuracy;Complex networks;Gait recognition;Parkinson's disease;Multimodal sensors","","10","","74","CCBYNCND","19 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine learning approaches have the potential to modernize PD symptom assessments by making them more quantitative, objective, and scalable. How-ever, the lack of benchmark video datasets for PD motor exams hinders model development. Here, we introduce the TULIP dataset to bridge this gap. TULIP emphasizes pre-cision and comprehensiveness, comprising multi-view video recordings (6 cameras) of 25 UPDRS motor exam activities, together with ratings by 3 clinical experts, in a cohort of Parkinson's patients and healthy controls. The multi-view recordings enable 3D reconstructions of body movement that better capture disease signatures than more conventional 2D methods. Using the dataset, we establish a base-line model for predicting UPDRS scores from 3D poses, illustrating how existing diagnostics could be automated. Looking ahead, TULIP could aid the development of new precision diagnostics that transcend UPDRS scores, providing a deeper understanding of PD and its potential treatments.","2575-7075","979-8-3503-5300-6","10.1109/CVPR52733.2024.02128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10656835","Parkinson’s Disease;Movement disorder;Video;explainable;Behavior analysis;Dataset;Multi-camera","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Parkinson's disease;Medical treatment;Manuals;Predictive models;Motors","","1","","69","IEEE","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we detail the approach and introduce a series of metrics deemed capable of quantifying the severity of tremor and bradykinesia in those with PD. The system has been tested on a 71-year-old participant with PD over a period of 15 days, a 72-year-old control user without PD, and a group of eight young adults. Results indicate a clear correlation between patient self-rating scores of tremor severity and metric values obtained, in addition to clear differences in metrics obtained from each user group.

The tremor behaviors in horizontal posture maintenance and reaching movement in three PD subjects were also obtained with this method. The average frequency of postural tremor was 4.34±0.15 Hz in all arm positions tested. However, the tremor magnitudes changed significantly with posture locations. In performing reaching movements, the tremor was inhibited prior to reaching, but resumed after reaching.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and severely incapacitating symptom of PD. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanism of FOG is still unclear. Electroencephalogram (EEG) as a non-invasive brain signal measurement method has been repeatedly used to reveal the pathological reasons behind PD. Since PD affects movement abilities, one particular type of EEG pattern called Movement-related cortical potential (MRCP), which was shown to be related to the generation of movement intention, can be a useful tool in PD research. However, most MRCP studies in PD area focus on the upper-limb movement like finger movement, to the best knowledge of the authors, no study explored MRCP characteristics during lower extremity movement in PD patients, particularly PD patients with FOG. This paper intends to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of MRCP and FOG by comparing MRCP signals among three groups: healthy controls group, PD patients without FOG group, and PD patients with FOG group. These three groups of participants were recruited based on age-matching and gender proportion matching criteria. During the experiment, the Electromyography (EMG) from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle and EEG were recorded when performing ankle dorsiflexion (AD) by the dominant foot. MRCP signals were extracted from EEG data based on the muscle activities in the TA muscle of the dominant foot. The results of this study show that, during lower limb activities, MRCP shares considerable similarities between PD patients and healthy participants. However, the amplitude of MRCP in PD patients (with and without FOG) is lower compared to the healthy participants. In addition, direct observations from the results show that MRCP from PD patients with FOG has higher amplitude but more variability in terms of amplitude and latency than those from PD patients without FOG.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176000","","Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Muscles;Foot;Parkinson's disease;Standards;Laplace equations","Evoked Potentials;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Movement;Parkinson Disease","1","","19","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To determine the dosage of levodopa, it is necessary to meet on a regular basis and observe motor function. The early detection and progression of the disease have been proposed using hypokinetic dysarthria. However, previous studies have not examined the effects of levodopa on speech rigorously and have provided inconsistent results. In this study, three sustained phonemes of PD patients were investigated for the effect of medication. A set of features characterizing vocal fold dynamics as well as the vocal tract coordinators were extracted from the sustained phonemes /of 28 PD patients during levodopa medication off and on states. All the features were statistically investigated and classified using a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. LDA classifier identified medication on from medication off based on the combined features from phoneme /a/, /o/ and /m/ with the accuracy=82.75% and F1-score=82.18%.

SoundCLR is a recently introduced self-supervised learning method that leverages consistency predictions to learn robust representations. GLAM, on the other hand, captures essential information in speech emotion through multi-scale feature representation and global perception fusion, and then employs data enhancement methods to train and optimize the model. By integrating these two techniques, we endeavor to achieve enhanced performance in PD classification, providing a valuable tool for medical professionals to diagnose and manage the disease more effectively.

A PD screening task aims to use the diagnostic data from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an assistance to prevent and delay the deterioration of PD. To perform this task, we propose a novel deep learning architecture called Deep neural networks with Broad Views (DBV). The proposed model builds upon Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) and ResNeXt, which can exploit multi-view data jointly.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the primitive methods for studying the human brain function. It is used for the detection of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders including PD. In this paper, we reported a study of the frontal and temporal EEG of Parkinson's disease patients using MATLAB platform. Lyapunov exponent and inverse Lyapunov exponent for both PD and healthy subjects were calculated within a given time frame. It was found that for PD subjects, the Lyapunov exponent for the temporal part of the brain is less than that of the frontal while the inverse Lyapunov exponent is reverse order of the brain.

All the data are transmitted in real-time and stored in a PC for data analysis.

Electroencephalography (EEG) of PD patients are an important tool for this diagnosis, as the disease pertains to the brain. Various temporal, frequency, and time-frequency domain approaches have been utilized to analyze EEG signals of patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In our research, Stockwell transform (S-transform or ST), which is a time-frequency technique, is used for the analysis of channel selection for detection of PD patients from healthy controls (HCs). A transformation of the EEG signal to the time-frequency domain is carried out using ST, and this transformed signal is utilized for all operations. The S-Transform-Amplitude (STA) matrix has been calculated to obtain the frequency-maximum-amplitude (FMA) plot for five channels of the mid-brain namely, C3, C4, Pz, Fz, and Cz. This plot is evaluated to extract statistical features. The features chosen for evaluation are mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and log-variance. Using the T-test, the p-value is calculated to find out the similarity and, hence, select appropriate channels and features. The estimated values for standard deviation and log-variance varied significantly in channels C3, Fz, and Cz for the two categories of subjects.

The intricate nature of PD, which often resembles other neurological conditions and involves subtle structural brain changes, complicates accurate diagnosis, resulting in a 25% diagnostic error rate. To address this challenge, the research community has employed various machine learning techniques using manually crafted features for diagnosis. This study introduces an innovative computer- aided diagnostic approach for PD based on a self-adaptive convolutional neural network (SCNN), a potent model for automatically extracting essential problem features. The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) provided the dataset used in this investigation, which includes a variety of datasets such as T2-weighted MRI scans from both PD individuals as well as healthy controls (HC). In particular, mid- slice MRI data is gathered and registered in order to be aligned. To pinpoint the region of interest in the midbrain, a 33 × 33-sized window is employed, as PD primarily affects the substantia nigra within the midbrain. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to validate the reliability of the SCNN approach. Using common evaluation measures like area under the curve, specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy, the suggested method's performance is evaluated. Notably, the evaluation findings show that in terms of diagnostic precision, the SCNN performs better than other machine learning techniques.","","979-8-3503-2518-8","10.1109/i-PACT58649.2023.10434712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10434712","Parkinson's disease;SCNN;MRI analysis;CAD diagnosis;Substantia nigra and Neurodegenerative disorders","Solid modeling;Parkinson's disease;Magnetic resonance imaging;Machine learning;Midbrain;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","","1","","11","IEEE","26 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Secondly, we fine-tune bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable it to under-stand and extract the semanteme of self-report, thus predicting each MDS-UPDRS item. Finally, we designed experiments on a large amount of test data to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework.

The novel application of Point Distribution Models (PDM) allows geometric variations and covariations of the landmark points to be captured from each video sequence. The PDM parameters represent quantifiable information that can be used to rate dyskinesia effectively, analogously to a neurologist's strategy of assessing the movement of multiple body parts simultaneously to effectively rate dyskinesia. A heuristic decision function is then developed using the PDM parameters to quantify the severity of the dyskinesia. The severity score using our decision function showed a high correlation to the dyskinesia rating of a neurologist on the corresponding patient videos.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-1814-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4649520","","Total variance;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;TV;Videos;Tracking;Biomedical imaging;Standards;Shape;Parkinson's disease;Video sequences","Analysis of Variance;Antiparkinson Agents;Biomedical Engineering;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced;Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced;Humans;Levodopa;Movement;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Tremor;Tremor;Video Recording;Video Recording","5","","8","IEEE","14 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two types of muscle contractions are examined: static contractions of biceps brachii muscles and elbow extension movements. Twelve features are extracted from static and ten features from extension measurements. These features describe signal morphology and nonlinear characteristics, power spreading in EMG wavelet scalograms and spectral coherence. Principal component approach is applied separately for static and extension trial to reduce the number of features before discrimination. The discrimination between subjects is done in a two-dimensional space by applying cluster analysis to the best discriminating principal components. The discrimination power of the used method was estimated with EMG and acceleration data measured from 56 patients with PD and 59 healthy controls. In the cluster analysis, three clusters were formed: one cluster with most (85%) of the healthy persons and two clusters with 80% of patients. Patients were divided into two clusters based on their type of motor disability (problems during movement and/or static contraction). Discrimination results show that EMG and acceleration measurements are potential for discriminating patients with PD from healthy persons. Furthermore, they have potential in the objective clinical assessment of PD.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5627267","","Electromyography;Acceleration;Muscles;Feature extraction;Parkinson's disease;Accelerometers;Elbow","Acceleration;Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnosis, Differential;Discriminant Analysis;Electromyography;Humans;Muscle, Skeletal;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Physical Examination;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","4","","10","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes the use of patient specific feature extraction together with adaptive support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to create a patient customized detector for PD. The patient specific feature extraction is obtained using the extrema of the ratio between the PD and non-PD spectra bands of each patient as features, while the adaptive SVM classifier adjusts its decision boundary until a suitable model is obtained. This yields individualised features and classifier pairs for each patient. Datasets containing local field potentials of PD patients were used to validate the method. Six of the nine patient datasets tested achieved a classification accuracy greater than 98%.

Because the symptoms of PD are so comparable to those of other disorders such as ageing and tremor, diagnosing PD can be a challenging task. Extensive research has been conducted in this area to identify the disease appropriately. PD is a neurological disorder of motion that often begins with a modest tremor in one hand and later evolves into a generalised stiffness. There are more than eight million people all around the world that are affected by this. Problems with one's vocal folds are experienced by most PD sufferers at some point during their illness. Having difficulties communicating is a sign of PD. To address those issues and improve the diagnosis and evaluation of PD. Methods based on Deep Learning (DL) have been implemented to differentiate between patients with PD and healthy individuals who exhibit similar clinical symptoms. These symptoms include movement disorders and other Parkinson's syndromes. The goal of these efforts is to address the issues that have been raised and to improve the diagnostic and evaluative processes for PD. In this study, a comprehensive literature search was carried out to deliver a comprehensive summary of the many data methodologies and DL algorithms utilised in diagnosing PD and performing differential diagnoses.","","979-8-3503-7018-8","10.1109/ASSIC60049.2024.10507957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10507957","Deep learning;Diagnosis;Parkinson's disease;Artificial Neural Network;Classification","Deep learning;Neurological diseases;Learning systems;Reviews;Parkinson's disease;Computer architecture;Artificial neural networks","","3","","30","IEEE","30 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes damage to the nervous system. PD is the most common neurological condition after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Language problems, agnosia, apraxia, executive function problems, and emotional control problems are the most common symptoms. In these circumstances, the system performs an acoustic analysis of voice acquisition from PD and Healthy controls through different phonetic and sustained vowel tasks. Preprocessing this acoustic signal using different feature extraction methods such as MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), TQWT (Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform), GFCC (Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform), etc. Classifiers like SVM (Support Vector Machines), RF (Random Forest), MLP (Multilayer Perceptron), KNN (K-nearest neighbors) and NN (Neural Network), reveal the existence of acoustic signs compatible with the speech of a PD or AD patient or, on the other hand, the provided audio data proves a healthy pattern. These techniques aim to improve people’s lives by detecting diseases early-stage and identifying patients’ messages to their caregivers.

This study proposes a novel pipeline for performing an automated analysis of lower limb bradykinesia in videos from complete routine clinical consultations in which the whole MDS-UPDRS is analyzed, utilizing computer vision techniques. The videos are segmented into temporal actions to identify tasks on the scale intended to assess lower limb bradykinesia, which are subjected to a process of person detection and subsequent pose estimation to extract kinematic features that facilitate modeling each task. The algorithm was evaluated using videos comprising PD patients and control subjects, demonstrating significant motor differences between the two groups, particularly regarding the toe-tapping test.

PD has been the fastest growth in prevalence, and it has become the leading cause of disability. The severity or progression of PD can be reduced if diagnosed at the early stages. It is therefore necessary to develop rapid and simple screening methods or tools to diagnose PD. Speech impairment is one of the early symptoms of PD which is commonly termed Parkinsonian hypokinetic dysarthria. Many researchers have developed a computerized method to identify of diagnosing PD based on voice features. However, the inaccuracy of the developed models was inconsistent especially when being tested on different datasets. The possible cause is the unwanted variability and biases between datasets. This study investigates the possible inconsistencies between Parkinson's voice datasets. The inconsistencies were investigated in the statistical distribution of voice parameters of the healthy-control (HC) group. This work observes the statistical distribution of sustained phoneme parameters extracted from the healthy-control (HC) group of five datasets using ANOVA and the Post-Hoc Turkey-Cramer test. The result suggests that the diversity in language and ethnicity were not contributing significantly to any biases between databases.

This data is transmitted using Bluetooth technology to a PC and once a freezing event is detected, a vibratory stimulus is produced on the left sole by triggering a micromotor at 275 Hz, which is embedded into the left shoe insole. The entire system was evaluated over a walking circuit designed to provoke FOG events during acquisition of kinematic data.

Genotype data, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), could be used as a prodromal factor for early detection of PD. However, the polygenic nature of PD presents a challenge as the complex relationships between SNPs towards disease development are difficult to model. Traditional assessment methods such as polygenic risk scores and machine learning approaches struggle to capture the complex interactions present in the genotype data, thus limiting their discriminative capabilities in diagnosis. On the other hand, DL models are better suited for this task. Nevertheless, they encounter difficulties of their own such as a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, in this work, a novel transformer encoder-based model is introduced to classify PD patients from healthy controls based on their genotype. This method is designed to effectively model complex global feature interactions and enable increased interpretability through the learned attention scores. The proposed framework outperformed traditional machine learning and deep learning baseline models. Moreover, visualization of the learned SNP-SNP associations provides not only interpretability to the model but also valuable insights into the biochemical pathways underlying PD development, which are corroborated by pathway enrichment analysis. Our results suggest novel SNP interactions to be further studied in wet lab and clinical settings.","2641-3604","978-1-6654-8791-7","10.1109/BHI56158.2022.9926815","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9926815","Parkinson's disease;Genomics;Deep learning","Deep learning;Limiting;Parkinson's disease;Biological system modeling;Genomics;Transformers;Environmental factors","","6","","13","IEEE","4 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, studies on functional connectivity could provide insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying PD. Hence, this study intends to provide a unified framework, Brain Graph Convolutional Networks (BGCN), incorporating the non-Euclidean heuristic-based brain functional connectivity into a graph-based deep learning model (GCN) for PD diagnosis.

As a result, the obtained functional connectivity corresponded to existing MRI studies in terms of the affected regions and hub shift. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we compared the heuristic functional connectivity speculation with random/uniform connectivity generated by K-nearest neighbors(k-NN).

There is no known cure for PD, although a number of therapies have been created to assist control its symptoms. Therefore, the management of PD is a field that is expanding, and there is a need to develop a comprehensive framework for the timely detection and classification of PD. In this paper, we developed six machine learning-based and five ensemble learning-based classification models to forecast PD. The six base classifiers which are used in the current study are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DTs), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB); and five ensemble classifiers named XGBoost, Gradient Boost, Bagging, CatBoost and Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) respectively, are then carefully compared. To improve the performance of the classifiers and to reduce the problem of overfitting, a feature selection method named Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various preprocessing techniques are applied.

Precise targeting of STN regions is a key factor for effective stimulation therapy. Dorsolateral neurons respond to motor movements and receive inputs mainly from the motor cortex. On the other hand, ventral portion is more related to cognitive functions. Several studies found a correlation between clinical motor scores (e.g. levodopa-related motor improvement) and the mean firing rate and signal power in the beta band. Albeit such findings are widely accepted, they might oversimplify the role of the STN in motor control. In this study, we characterized the spiking and bursting activity of STN sub-regions using intra operative multi electrode recordings and highly accurate channel localization techniques.

Data were obtained from 25 PD both before (OFF) and after (ON) dopaminergic therapy and from 18 healthy subjects (HS). PDs were divided into three groups: PD comprising all patients, NFOG comprising patients who do not present FoG, and FOG who do. The stride length and clearance values were then compared between each other both between OFF and ON and between the different groups. The study demonstrated that there is a significant difference in stride length values both between PDs and HSs and between OFF and ON in PDs. A significant difference was also found for clearance values apart from comparisons between OFF and ON states of PDs, NFOG and FOG. Furthermore, a validation of the IMU system was carried out through an accuracy analysis comparing it with an optoelectronic system. The validation reported a relative percentage error of 13.8±10.2%.

Inertial measurement units were used to capture kinematic data during pull tests performed by a trained clinician. The kinematic data obtained from each pull test were analyzed and aggregated. The center of mass profile was found to effectively differentiate between patient groups. The patients with postural instability exhibited an increase in center of mass and number of steps and a decrease in step length. The groups could be differentiated based on the relationship between step length, center of mass and number of steps. This suggests that a quantitative pull test can provide kinematic metrics that are useful for measuring PI in patients with PD.

The intelligent diagnosis of this condition poses a significant challenge. Despite abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory (RSP), and pulse signals in PD, which are closely linked to clinical symptoms, there remains a dearth of intelligent diagnostic models centered on multimodal physiological signals. In this study, we gathered multimodal physiological data from 55 PD patients and 30 healthy individuals, comprising ECG, photoplethysmogram (PPG), and RSP. Subsequently, we proposed a random forest classification model employing averaging probabilities, achieving an 89.41% accuracy in distinguishing between PD patients and healthy controls. Moreover, a feature ranking analysis was conducted on the time-domain features across the three modalities. This analysis unveiled the significance of time-domain features from diverse physiological signals in identifying PD, leading to optimization of the classification model and ultimately attaining a classification accuracy of 90.59%. In addition, the pulse and breathing characteristics in the open eyes state contribute more to disease identification, while the closed eyes state is mainly based on ECG characteristics.

In clinical practice, the FP-CIT SPECT scans are one of the most widely used tools to diagnose PD and also to measure its progression. Whereas Healthy Control (HC) subjects show their striatum region highly illuminated and with a c-shape, in patients with PD this area is not as much highlighted and it presents a rounded shape. Traditionally, analysis of FP-CIT scans have been carried out following voxel-wise comparisons between HC and PD subjects. This approach is limited due to the necessity of non-linear spatial registrations that might alter artificially the interclass separation between HC and PD subjects due to the intrinsic deformation of striatum region in PD scans. In this scenario, morphological analyses have become a more effective alternative for determining this separation. In this work we analyze the contour of 208 FP-CIT SPECT volumes to obtain a set of features that will support PD diagnosis. For this purpose, 3D alpha-shapes have been used to measure this contour. In addition, we propose a method to determine the intensity threshold from which most of the information is contained.

When using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for PD diagnosis, relying solely on T1-weighted (T1) or Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) images cannot comprehensively consider the information about different types of brain lesions, leading to a bottleneck in improving the classification accuracy. This study utilize a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to integrate multi-modal MRI data for PD diagnosis. Clinical data shows accuracy of multi-modal 3D-CNN is higher than accuracy of single-modal 3D-CNN, when all tissue data is used as input, the classification accuracy of multi-modal 3D-CNN can reach 91%, which can prove that the multi-modal fusion method is superior to the direct use of single-modal data. Furthermore, by focusing on several basal ganglia structures that were reported to be significantly affected by PD, this 3D-CNN model shows that substantia nigra, caudate, and especially thalamus have a high sensitivity for PD diagnosis. The findings indicate the potential of using multi-modal deep learning approaches for PD diagnosis and suggest that the selected basal ganglia structures are highly sensitive markers for PD detection.

This effect is quantified for three different gait paces. The results show that the mean and maximum stride times when the subjects walk at their regular pace are the most determinant to detect PD.

Extraction of neurobiomarkers from STN local field potential activity can be used for the optimization of DBS. Beta (12–30 Hz) and high frequency oscillations (200–450 Hz, HFO) of STN and their phase-amplitude coupling have been previously correlated with symptom severity in PD. The typical approach is to take bipolar derivations of electrode contacts in order to enhance recordings of local brain activity and suppress noise levels. This approach can often cancel the signals in correlated neighboring contacts and create ambiguity in which monopolar contact to select for the identification of the main source of the oscillatory signal. To improve local specificity and help identify the source of beta and HFO in terms of electrode contact, we propose a semi supervised blind-source separation method. This approach presents a novel perspective to investigate electrophysiology by projecting the recorded channels into a subspace of virtual channels. We show the contribution of each channel to the identified source and correlate the spatial information with imaging and post-operative programming parameters. We anticipate such a source identification strategy can be used in the future to investigate the distribution of beta and HFO on individual contacts of the DBS lead and can improve the interpretation of these signals.","1948-3554","978-1-6654-6292-1","10.1109/NER52421.2023.10123890","National Institutes of Health; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(grant numbers:R01NS124650); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123890","Parkinson's;beta;HFO;biomarker;projection","Electrodes;Parkinson's disease;Satellite broadcasting;Programming;Hafnium oxide;Recording;High frequency","","","","18","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, studies analyzing how and if deep learning models may use such effects as a shortcut are scarce. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate if site-related effects are encoded in the feature space of an established deep learning model designed for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification based on T1-weighted MRI datasets. Therefore, all layers of the PD classifier were frozen, except for the last layer of the network, which was replaced by a linear layer that was exclusively re-trained to predict three potential bias types (biological sex, scanner type, and originating site). Our findings based on a large database consisting of 1880 MRI scans collected across 41 centers show that the feature space of the established PD model (74% accuracy) can be used to classify sex (75% accuracy), scanner type (79% accuracy), and site location (71% accuracy) with high accuracies despite this information never being explicitly provided to the PD model during original training. Overall, the results of this study suggest that trained image-based classifiers may use unwanted shortcuts that are not meaningful for the actual clinical task at hand. This finding may explain why many image-based deep learning models do not perform well when applied to data from centers not contributing to the training set.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3352513","Parkinson Association of Alberta; Hotchkiss Brain Institute; Consortium canadien en neurodégénérescence associée au vieillissement; Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chairs; River Fund at Calgary Foundation; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Tourmaline Chair in Parkinson; PPMI-a; OpenfMRI; UK Biobank; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388228","Biases;deep learning;shortcut learning","Diseases;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biological system modeling;Training;Deep learning;Brain modeling;Databases","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Machine Learning;Support Vector Machine","14","","34","CCBY","10 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2020.2978197","UK EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/R511547/1); UK EPSRC Imperial College London Centre for Doctoral Training in Neruotechnology; UK Dementia Research Institute Care Research and Technology (DRI-CRT) Centre; UKIERI(grant numbers:2016-17-0103); Serg Technologies; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064818","Parkinson’s disease symptoms;wearable sensor system;machine learning;MMG;telemedicine;muscle stiffness","Rigidity;Sensors;Parkinson's disease;Satellite broadcasting;Three-dimensional displays;Muscles","Cross-Sectional Studies;Humans;Hypokinesia;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Parkinson Disease;Tremor","53","","54","CCBY","13 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis is an important tool for studying dynamic changes in brain functional activity. This study explores the pathophysiological changes in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients by analyzing the EEG microstate of PD patients, and analyzes the impact of rTMS on the clinical symptoms of PD patients. In a trial, 25 patients with PD and 18 healthy subjects of the same age were included. The clinical scale (the third part of Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) scores of each patient were evaluated and the microstate characteristic parameters of all subjects were calculated. 10 Hz rTMS was used to stimulate the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) of PD patients. After two weeks of treatment (10 times), the clinical scale score of each patient was re-evaluated and the microstate characteristic parameters were calculated. At the baseline, the occurrence, duration and coverage of microstate C in PD patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P <0.05),and were significantly negatively correlated with the MoCA score (P <0.05). The duration and coverage of microstate D in PD patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (P <0.05), and were significantly negatively correlated with UPDRS-III score (P <0.05). After rTMS treatment in the PD group, the scale score of UPDRS-III was significantly reduced (P <0.05) and the scale score of MoCA was significantly increased. Moreover, the occurrence and coverage of microstate B were significantly increased (p <0.05). The occurrence, duration and coverage of microstate C were significantly reduced (P <0.05). The occurrence, duration and coverage of microstate D were significantly increased (P <0.05). This study shows that abnormal brain functional activity of PD patients can change microstate characteristic parameters, and these changes are significantly related to the decline of motor and cognitive functions. Furthermore, rTMS can improve the motor and cognitive functions and adjust the microstate characteristic parameters of PD patients. EEG microstate analysis can reflect the therapeutic effect of rTMS on PD patients.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3418846","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52320105008,51877067); Key Research and Development Project of Hebei Province(grant numbers:21372002D); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10570451","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation;Parkinson’s disease;EEG;microstate analysis","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Diseases;Surfaces;Voltage;Motors;Parkinson's disease","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Male;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation;Female;Electroencephalography;Middle Aged;Aged;Motor Cortex","6","","50","CCBY","25 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The aim of this study was twofold. First, to use a multiple regression normalization strategy that accounts for subject age, height, body mass, gender, and self-selected walking speed to identify differences in spatial-temporal gait features between PD patients and controls; and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning strategies in classifying PD gait after gait normalization. Spatial-temporal gait data during self-selected walking were obtained from 23 PD patients and 26 aged-matched controls. Data were normalized using standard dimensionless equations and multiple regression normalization. Machine learning strategies were then employed to classify PD gait using the raw gait data, data normalized using dimensionless equations, and data normalized using the multiple regression approach. After normalizing data using the dimensionless equations, only stride length, step length, and double support time were significantly different between PD patients and controls (p <; 0.05); however, normalizing data using the multiple regression method revealed significant differences in stride length, cadence, stance time, and double support time. Random Forest resulted in a PD classification accuracy of 92.6% after normalizing gait data using the multiple regression approach, compared to 80.4% (support vector machine) and 86.2% (kernel Fisher discriminant) using raw data and data normalized using dimensionless equations, respectively.

To this end, we apply two methods, Seed Correlation Analysis (SCA) and probabilistic independent Component Analysis (PICA). The results of advanced statistical group analysis on SCA values show that there is negative significant correlation between motor cortex and cerebellum in healthy, while this connection in PD is positive and not significant. This result implies the disturbance of equilibrium function of the brain in resting. Moreover, in both groups, there is significant positive correlation between areas located in basal ganglia. The results show that in healthy, there is not significant correlation between motor areas and basal ganglia, while in PD there are significant negative correlations between motor cortex and cerebellum with areas located in basal ganglia. The comparison of five ICs extracted by PICA showed lower DMN activation in basal ganglia.

To this end, a mean-field model of the BGTCS is used. This model is able to reproduce both the normal and parkinsonian activities of the BG, thalamus and motor cortex in a unified structure. Using this model, we simulate DBS and MCS, and compared the effect of location of stimulation on mean firing rates of the BGTCS. Our results suggest that DBS of the STN and MCS could restore thalamus relay activity, but DBS effects on PD are stronger than MCS. Consequently, stimulation of cortex seems to mimic the stimulation of STN in a relatively less effective manner.

Standardized tests improve on the reliability but are still prone to subjective ratings and require human expert knowledge. This paper presents a novel method to characterize the motor state of Parkinson patients using full body motion capturing data based on a combination of multiple metrics. Our approach merges various metrics with a Random Forest and uses a probabilistic formulation to compute a one-dimensional measure for the performed motion.

We hypothesised that rythmic excitation of lower limb afferents, matched to a participant’s comfortable pace, would entrain deficient neuro-muscular signals resulting in improved gait. Five people with mild to moderate PD symptoms (70 ± 9 years) were tested on medication before and after a 30-minute familierization session. Paired t-tests and Cohen’s d were used to assess gait changes and report effect sizes. Participant experiences were recorded through structured interviews. Lower limb stimulation resulted in an acute 15% increase in gait speed (p=0.006, d=0.62), an 11% increase in step length (p=0.04, d=0.35), a 44% reduction in step time variability (p=0.03, d=0.91), a 22% increase in perceived gait quality (p=0.04, d=1.17), a 24% reduction in mental effort to walk (p=0.02, d=0.79) and no statistical difference for cadence (p=0.16). Participants commented positively on the benefit of stimulation during training but found that stimulation could be distracting when not walking and the socks hard to put on.

Currently there are no objective methods to assess the efficacy of DBS, hence the adjustment is based solely on clinical assessment. In optimal case an objectively measurable feature would point the right settings of DBS. Surface electromyographic and kinematic measurements have been used in Parkinson's disease research. As Parkinson's disease symptoms are known to change the EMG signal properties, these methods could be helpful aid in the clinical adjustment of DBS. In this study, 13 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received DBS treatment were measured. The patients were measured with seven different settings of the DBS in clinical range including changes in stimulation amplitude, frequency and pulse width. The EMG analysis was based on parameters that characterize EMG signal morphology. Correlation dimension and recurrence rate made the most significant difference in relation to optimal settings. In conclusion, EMG analysis is able to detect differences between the DBS setups, and can help in finding the correct parameters.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944315","","Satellite broadcasting;Electromyography;Parkinson's disease;Brain stimulation;Current measurement;Educational institutions","Aged;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electrodes;Electromyography;Female;Humans;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Severity of Illness Index","4","","15","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subsequently, in the second layer, three single-symptom models differentiated PD motor characteristics from normal motion patterns and quantified the severity of cardinal PD symptoms in parallel. In order to further analyze the disease status, the multilevel severity quantification was fused in the third layer, where machine learning algorithms were adopted to develop a multisymptom severity score. The experimental results demonstrated that the quantification of three cardinal symptoms was highly accurate to distinguish PD patients from healthy controls. Furthermore, strong correlations were observed between the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores and the predicted subscores for tremor  ${(R = 0.75,\;P = 1.40e - 3)}$ , bradykinesia  ${(R = 0.71,\;P = 2.80e - 3)}$ , and coordination impairments  ${(R = 0.69,\;P = 4.20e - 3)}$ , and the correlation coefficient can be enhanced to  ${0.88}\,\,{(P = 1.26e - 5)}$  based on the fusion schemes. In conclusion, the proposed assessment architecture holds great promise to push forward the in-home monitoring of clinical manifestations, thus enabling the self-assessment of disease progression.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2021.3123157","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1913601,61720106012); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:Z170003); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Science(grant numbers:XDB32040000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9586066","Machine learning;multilevel fusion;multisymptom assessment;Parkinson’s disease (PD);wearable sensor system","Diseases;Machine learning;Hidden Markov models;Accelerometers;Monitoring;Gyroscopes;Parkinson’s disease;Sensor systems;Parkinson's disease;Wearable devices","","17","","36","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective was to use wearable sensors to quantify the dose response of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia in individuals with PD. Methods: Thirteen individuals with PD and fluctuating motor benefit were instrumented with wrist and ankle motion sensors and recorded by video. Kinematic data were recorded as subjects completed a series of activities in a simulated home environment through transition from off to on medication. Subjects were evaluated using the unified Parkinson disease rating scale motor exam (UPDRS-III) at the start and end of data collection. Algorithms were applied to the kinematic data to score tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia. A blinded clinician rated severity observed on video. Accuracy of algorithms was evaluated by comparing scores with clinician ratings using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Algorithm scores for tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia agreed with clinician ratings of video recordings (ROC area > 0.8). Summary metrics extracted from time intervals before and after taking medication provided quantitative measures of therapeutic response (p <; 0.01). Radar charts provided intuitive visualization, with graphical features correlated with UPDRS-III scores (R = 0.81). Conclusion: A system with wrist and ankle motion sensors can provide accurate measures of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia as patients complete routine activities. Significance: This technology could provide insight on motor fluctuations in the context of daily life to guide clinical management and aid in development of new therapies.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2697764","National Institute on Aging; National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:5R44AG044293); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911257","Dyskinesia;levodopa;parkinson's disease;technology;wearble sensors","Monitoring;Diseases;Wrist;Algorithm design and analysis;Biomedical monitoring;Wearable sensors","Aged;Algorithms;Biomechanical Phenomena;Cohort Studies;Drug Monitoring;Dyskinesias;Female;Humans;Levodopa;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;ROC Curve;Wearable Electronic Devices","99","","28","IEEE","25 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study investigated the validity of such graphical tasks to assess upper limb function in PD patients and their ability to detect subtle changes in performance. Fourteen PD patients performed graphical tasks before and after taking dopaminergic medication. Graphical tasks included figure tracing, writing, and a modified Fitts' task. The Purdue pegboard test was performed to validate these graphical tasks. Movement time (MT), writing size, and the presence of tremor were assessed. MT on the graphical tasks correlated significantly with performance on the Purdue pegboard test (Spearman's ρ > 0.65; p <; 0.05). MT decreased significantly after the intake of dopaminergic medication. Tremor power decreased after taking dopaminergic medication in most PD patients who suffered from tremor. Writing size did not correlate with performance on the Purdue pegboard test, nor did it change after taking medication. Our set of graphical tasks is valid to assess upper limb function in PD patients. MT proved to be the most useful measure for this purpose. The response on dopaminergic medication was optimally reflected by an improved MT on the graphical tasks in combination with a decreased tremor power, whereas writing size did not respond to dopaminergic treatment.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2503802","DiPAR; EC(grant numbers:FP7-SME-201001,262291); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337361","Bradykinesia;drawing;graphical tasks;handwriting;micrographia;Parkinson's disease;tremor;upper limb function;validity","Medical diagnostic imaging;Writing;Diseases;Biomedical measurement;Spirals;Monitoring","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Dopamine Agents;Female;Handwriting;Humans;Hypokinesia;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Skills;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Task Performance and Analysis;Upper Extremity","23","","31","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This will enhance quality of life (QoL) in PD through improved self-monitoring and also provide information that could be shared with a healthcare provider to help better manage treatment. Until recently, nonmotor symptoms (“soft signs”) had been generally overlooked in clinical management, yet these are of primary importance to patients and their QoL. Day-to-day variability of the condition, the high variability in symptoms between patients, and the isolated snapshots of a patient in periodic clinic visits make better monitoring essential to the proper management of PD. Continuously monitored patterns of activity, social interactions, and daily activities could provide a rich source of information on status changes, guiding self-correction and clinical management. The same tools can be useful in earlier detection of PD and will improve clinical studies. Remote medical communications in the form of telemedicine, sophisticated tracking of medication use, and assistive technologies that directly compensate for disease-related challenges are examples of other near-term technology solutions to PD problems. Ultimately, a sensor technology is not good if it is not used.

In addition, this study aimed to determine the most suitable EEG sensor location to detect freezing of gait during turning using our classification system. Data from four Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait was analysed using power spectral density and brain effective connectivity, comparing periods of successful turning with freezing of gait during turning. Results showed that freezing of gait during turning is associated with significant alterations in the high beta and theta power spectral densities across the occipital and parietal areas. Furthermore, brain effective connectivity showed that freezing during turning was associated with increased connectivity towards the visual area, which also had the highest accuracy to detect freezing episodes in the O1 regions by using power spectral density in our classification analyses.

Due to these symptoms and as the disease progresses in patients, it is difficult to perform daily activities and socialize with other people. The traditional system of evaluation of the disease is tedious due to the constant physical repetitions performed by the patient and its result is subject to the expertise of the specialist. To solve this problem, in the present work we have developed a system capable of analyzing hand movements based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scale using finger tapping test, in patients with PD using the Kinect v2 device. Four patients with Parkinson's disease and two healthy patients were tested during six sessions; the results showed that 83.3% of the sample had lower velocity in the upper right extremity. A tendency analysis determined that 75% of patients with Parkinson's disease had a possible decrease in speed in one or both limbs.

Our idea is to employ LSTM to detect walking abnormalities. To examine the effectiveness, we conducted some experiments. Firstly, two Parkinson's disease patients in on-state were asked to perform two 60-seconds walks. Secondly, a healthy person performed pseudo-off-state abnormal gait by attaching rubber restraints to his feet. Finally, a model was generated by the time series of acceleration in off-state patients' walk. The model was then used to calculate Mahalanobis distance to examine anomalies by comparing the model to the pseudo off-state walk data. As a result, the distance exhibited significantly high values at the pseudo off-state walk phases, which suggests that the proposed simple method will detect off-state walking by actual Parkinson’s disease patients.","","978-1-6654-1904-8","10.1109/LifeTech53646.2022.9754768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754768","Parkinson’s Disease;Off Phenomenon;Accelerometer;Walking;Periodicity","Legged locomotion;Performance evaluation;Parkinson's disease;Time series analysis;Medical services;Logic gates;Data models","","3","","4","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Objectives: quantify the motor response to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease using a portable and inexpensive RGB-D camera (Kinect) Methods: 11 PD patients were included. Descriptive analysis were used for clinical variables. Spearmańs rank correlation was used to correlate the age and the gait variables. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used for the gait variables comparison between ON and OFF states. Results: In ON state PD patients showed increments in global speed [p=0.007], ankle speed [p<;0.001], ankle stride length [p=0.001], arm swing speed [p=0.008], and arm swing magnitude [p=0.014], these results slightly changed when the sample was analyzed taking into account the individual behavior of each limb. In comparison with the upper limbs, levodopa response was more uniform in the lower limbs.

The postural tremor occurs while a body part is held straight out from the body in a stable position against gravity. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which is a subjective assessment performed by the qualitative judgment of neurologists, is the clinical standard for parkinsonian tremor assessment. Despite the common use of subjective methods, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors are largely used in many studies as a motion capture system to objective assessment of tremors. However, this kind of sensor must be attached to the patient’s body, it limits the patient’s movements and requires specific techniques for correct positioning in the limb. In this sense, non-contact capacitive (NCC) sensors are an alternative proposed in this research to record the motor activity of the hand and wrist during a pose against gravity. In order to assess the postural tremor and evaluate this novel sensing technology, data from ten subjects, five with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and five neurologically healthy (H) matched in age and sex, were collected. We analyzed the instantaneous mean frequency (IMNF) of the signals from NCC and gyroscope sensors for both groups. The selected descriptive statistical variables allowed discrimination (p < 0.05) among subjects from H and PD groups while using the gyroscope or the NCC sensor. The obtained results indicate that the NCC sensor can measure the postural hand tremor, and also that frequency features extracted from the collected signals can be used to discriminate subjects from both groups.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856746","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8856746","Postural tremor;Parkinson’s disease;Non-contact capacitive sensor;Frequency analysis","Gyroscopes;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Diseases;Capacitive sensors;Task analysis;Gravity","Humans;Motion;Movement;Parkinson Disease;Tremor;Wrist","4","","18","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, evaluation of the speech intelligibility is performed based on the unified PD rating scale. Specifically, section 3.1 (eloquence) of the cited scale provides the specialist with some tips to evaluate the patient's speech ability. With the aim of evaluating the speech intelligibility by measuring the variation in parameters in an objective manner, we show that a speech-to-text (STT) system could help specialists to obtain an accurate and objective measure of speech, phrase, and word intelligibility in PD. STT systems are based on methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers and computerized devices. We decided to base our study on Google STT conversion. We expand Voxtester, a software system for digital assessment of voice and speech changes in PD, in order to perform this study. No previous studies have been presented to address the mentioned challenges based on STT.

FoG was quantified from the power spectral density of the antero-posterior shank acceleration from which a Frequency Ratio was calculated as the square of the total power in the 3-8 Hz band, divided by the square of the total power in the .5-3 Hz band. Spatiotemporal gait parameters calculated from synchronized gyroscopes on the two legs were also measured in these subjects. The Frequency Ratio was significantly larger in freezers than in non-freezers or control subjects. It better differentiated gait disorders between PD subjects with and without FoG than traditional gait measures such as stride length, stride velocity and double support time.

When compared to popular types of linear regression (OLS and LASSO), the nonlinear models fit their data better and generalize to unseen data significantly better. It was found that models developed for healthy control subjects generalized to other control subjects well, however the models trained on subjects with PD did not generalize well to other PD patients, which complicates the issue of being able to detect the progression of the disease.

Dopamine synthesis, a critical process in PD, is heavily impacted by genetic factors, contributing to motor dysfunction and neurocognitive impairment. While some genetic mutations have been linked to PD-related neurocognitive impairments, the specific impact of these mutations on NFs remains unclear. This study explores the relationship between mutations in dopamine synthesis-related genes and NFs in PD patients and healthy controls (HC). Using a gene sequencing dataset (INDELs and SNPs) from the PPMI repository that includes 171 dopamine synthesis-related genes, we applied t-tests to identify 34 significantly mutated genes. We considered subjective (self-reported) responses from the MDS-UPDRS for seven NFs (i.e., motor, autonomic function, behavior/psychological, executive function, sensory, sleep, and speech). To investigate the link between significantly mutated genes and neurocognitive performance, participants were grouped into healthy and PD groups, and then each group was split into mutated and non-mutated samples. For healthy controls, presence of mutation in CAMK2D, and NOSTRIN and absence of mutation in DDX17 found related to NF worsening. In case of PD samples, the presence of mutations in genes like B3GALT5, CHRNA2, SNX27, TRIP4, and UBQLN4 and absence of mutation in genes like ABCA7, INTS4, MYLK3, PRKG1, and PRKN were linked to worsening neurocognitive outcomes. Overall, these findings provide a deeper understanding of the genetic influences on neurocognitive functions in PD and highlight potential targets for future research and therapeutic strategies.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-8622-6","10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10822140","Dopamine Synthesis-related Gene;Gene Mutation;Gene Sequencing;Neurocognitive Function;Parkinson’s Disease","Sequential analysis;Correlation;Genetic mutations;Motors;Genetics;Reflection;Rapid eye movement sleep;Noise measurement;Diseases;Testing","","","","56","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A variety of systems and methods have been proposed for instrumenting the TUG test, but only limited information has been published regarding phase classification. In this paper an automated TUG phase classification methodology is proposed and validated in a study with 16 Parkinson's disease patients. Statistical, signal energy, chronological and gait features were extracted from acceleration and orientation signals of shoe mounted inertial measurement units. The phases `sit to walk', `walking', `first turn', `second turn' and `turn to sit' were segmented in a two stage classifier approach. Strides were used for a separation of the walking phase and classifiers like NaiveBayes, k-Nearest-Neighbor, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest for the final phase segmentation. SVM performed best with a mean sensitivity of 81.80 % over all phases. Additionally, the impact of UPDRS and Hoehn & Yahr ratings on the phase times was assessed.

Here, we have focused on exploring the contribution of Loading Response and Terminal Stance to risk of fall along with the relevance of postural deformity (e.g., knee bending) while an individual walked overground on pathways (with 0° and 180° turn) under dual task condition.

Symptoms of Parkinson's disease may include resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, a forward stooped posture, postural instability, and freezing of gait. As reported by several researchers, the forward stooped posture and freezing of gait are the most critical reasons to make the Parkinson's disease patients fall. The main objective of this research is to develop a fall prevention system for Parkinson's disease patients. There are two phases in the fall prevention protocol. The first phase is to detect and recognize the stooped posture and freezing of gait symptoms from the patient's movement activities. The next phase is to alarm an audio cue to break the block of freezing. An accelerometer based sensor network is designed to sense the movement information. The recorded data are transferred to the smartphone, which served as the core calculator unit, by Bluetooth communication protocol. The input signals are recognized and classified into the target symptoms. The main advantages of this proposed approach includes: (1) the safety: to detect the stooped posture and freezing of gait and to produce audio cue to help the patients to break the block; (2) the portability: not limited at specific locations; and (3) the expendability: easy to update or upgrade by using app install online.","","978-9-8975-8149-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350530","Sensor Network;Parkinson's Disease;Freezing of Gait;Derivative Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm;Accelerometer","Parkinson's disease;Acceleration;Foot;Accelerometers;Time series analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Bluetooth","","1","","24","","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work demonstrates a fully automated closed-loop DBS system so that stimulation can be applied on-demand only when needed to treat PD symptoms. The proposed LAMSTAR network uses spectral, entropy and recurrence rate parameters for prediction of the advent of tremor after the DBS stimulation is switched off. These parameters are extracted from non-invasively collected surface electromyography and accelerometry signals. The LAMSTAR network has useful characteristics, such as fast retrieval of patterns and ability to handle large amount of data of different types, which make it attractive for medical applications. Out of 21 trials blue from one subject, the average ratio of delay in prediction of tremor to the actual delay in observed tremor from the time stimulation was switched off achieved by the proposed LAMSTAR network is 0.77.

Based on our earlier studies on corticospinal transmission of tremor signals [10,11], we hypothesize that cutaneous afferents evoked by surface stimulation can produce an inhibitory effect on propriospinal neurons (PN), which in turn will suppress tremor signals passing through the PN. This paper presents the development of a closed-loop system for tremor suppression by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of sensory fibers beneath the skin. The closed-loop system senses EMGs of forearm muscles, and detects rhythmic bursting in the EMG signal. When a tremor is detected by the system, a command signal triggers a stimulator to output a train of bi-phasic, current regulated pulses to a pair of surface electrodes. The stimulation electrode is placed on the dorsal hand skin near the metacarpophalangeal joint of index finger, which is innervated by the superficial radial nerve that projects an inhibitory afferent to PNs of forearm muscles. We tested the closed-loop system in 3 normal subjects to verify the algorithm and in 2 tremor dominated PD subjects for feasibility of tremor detecting and suppression. Preliminary results indicate that the closed-loop system can detect tremor in all subjects, and tremor in PD patients was suppressed significantly by electrical stimulation of cutaneous afferents.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0220-4","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591063","Parkinson's disease;resting tremor;cutaneous afferent;transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation;closed-loop system!","Electromyography;Closed loop systems;Digital signal processing;Muscles;Band-pass filters;Flexible printed circuits;Electrical stimulation","Electric Stimulation;Electromyography;Forearm;Humans;Muscle, Skeletal;Parkinson Disease;Tremor","11","","13","IEEE","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data coming from 25 individuals with different levels of PD symptoms severity and an equal number of age-matched healthy individuals were included into a set of 6 different machine learning (ML) techniques, processing 18 different configurations of gait parameters taken from 8 IMU sensors. Classification accuracy was calculated for each configuration and ML technique, adding two meta-classifiers based on the results obtained from all individual techniques through majority of voting, with two different weighting schemes. Average classification accuracy ranged between 63% and 80% among classifiers and increased up to 96% for one meta-classifier configuration. Configurations based on a statistical preselection process showed the highest average classification accuracy. When reducing the number of sensors, features based on the joint range of motion were more accurate than those based on spatio-temporal parameters.

Traditional PD assessment is conducted by a physician during infrequent clinic visits. Using smartphones, remote patient monitoring has the potential to obtain objective behavioral data semi-continuously, track disease fluctuations, and avoid rater dependency. Methods: Smartphones collect sensor data during various active tests and passive monitoring, including balance (postural instability), dexterity (skill in performing tasks using hands), gait (the pattern of walking), tremor (involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation), and voice. Some of the features extracted from smartphone data are potentially associated with specific PD symptoms identified by physicians. To leverage large-scale cross-modality smartphone features, we propose a machine-learning framework for performing automated disease assessment. The framework consists of a two-step feature selection procedure and a generic model based on the elastic-net regularization. Results: Using this framework, we map the PD-specific architecture of behaviors using data obtained from both PD participants and healthy controls (HCs). Utilizing these atlases of features, the framework shows promises to (a) discriminate PD participants from HCs, and (b) estimate the disease severity of individuals with PD.

Beyond the physical symptoms, it encroaches upon cognitive and emotional domains, often leading to depression and cognitive decline. A recent breakthrough in diagnosis involves a voice-based model that detects subtle speech irregularities linked to Parkinson's. This innovative approach relies on a dataset comprising 24 columns capturing diverse symptoms, from motor impairments to non-motor indicators. This dataset serves as a crucial foundation for training and validating the model's accuracy. By analyzing individual symptom profiles, this multidimensional approach facilitates early detection and tailored intervention, essential for effectively managing the disease's progression. Integrating advanced technology with comprehensive clinical data represents a significant step forward in Parkinson's disease management, promising personalized care and improved outcomes for patients by addressing their unique needs and challenges. Furthermore, the integration of voice analysis adds a non-invasive dimension to Parkinson's diagnosis, potentially improving accessibility to screening methods.

The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of possible nonlinear interactions between LFP rhythms characterizing the output structure of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internus, by means of bispectral analysis. The results of this study disclosed that the rhythms expressed in the globus pallidus internus of the untreated parkinsonian patient are not independent and, in particular, the low-beta (13-20 Hz) band generates harmonics that are included in the high-beta (20-35 Hz) band. Conversely, in the dystonic globus pallidus, as well as in the parkinsonian globus pallidus after dopaminergic medication (i.e., in the more ldquonormalrdquo condition), the rhythms are substantially independent and characterized by a strong activity in the low-frequency band that generates a second harmonic (4-14 Hz), mostly included in the same band. The interactions between rhythms in the human globus pallidus are therefore different in different pathologies and in different patient's states. The interpretation of these interactions is likely critical for fully understanding the role of LFP rhythms in the pathophysiology of human basal ganglia.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2007.907893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359229","Basal ganglia;bispectral analysis;deep brain stimulation;dystonia;Parkinson's disease;Bispectral Analysis;Basal ganglia;Deep brain stimulation;Dystonia;Parkinson's disease","Rhythm;Humans;Basal ganglia;Brain stimulation;Satellite broadcasting;Parkinson's disease;Information analysis;Information processing;Character generation;Pathology","Basal Ganglia;Deep Brain Stimulation;Dystonia;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials;Globus Pallidus;Humans;Oscillometry;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Reference Values","35","","76","IEEE","12 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, with the popularization of deep learning, gait detection technology has gradually matured. These techniques are increasingly used in medical diagnostics, such as Parkinson's severity detection. In recent years, Transformer models have been more and more widely and successfully used in the fields of natural language processing and image recognition. It illustrates that the Transformer-based model has a good ability for feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based model to detect the severity of Parkinson's symptoms. In the previous experiments, although the performance of the transformer is good, the disadvantage of its large memory footprint is also obvious. We improved our model to decouple temporal and spatial information extraction. This greatly increases the speed of the model. Concretely, we first obtained data consisting of 18 foot sensors from a public dataset, then preprocesses the input time series data, and adds unique temporal position coding to it. Second, feed them into 18 parallel temporal attention extraction modules and concatenate them together then input them into the dimensionality reduction layer for dimensionality reduction. Finally, they are input to the spatial attention extraction module and classified through the final linear layer. We applied and compared GLU (Gated Linear Unit), and GAU (Gated Attention Unit), which made our model better and faster. The experimental results show that using the public dataset provided by Physionet, the accuracy of the model reaches 97.4%, which is about 11.7% higher than the original model. The improved algorithm has high accuracy and practicability for Parkinson's gait analysis tasks and can better meet practical needs.","","978-1-6654-8887-7","10.1109/CISP-BMEI56279.2022.9980289","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62162062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9980289","deep learning;Parkinson;gait classification;Transformer;Gated Attention Unit","Dimensionality reduction;Image recognition;Time series analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Logic gates;Signal processing;Transformers","","5","","18","IEEE","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, graph theory-based studies are proving altered structural connectivity in PD. This motivated us to employ regional grey matter volume of PD patients (N=70) for comparative network analysis with an equal number of age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). In the current study, normalized grey matter maps obtained from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) were parcellated into 56 ROI (regions of interest) for construction of symmetric matrix using partial correlation between every pair of regional grey matter volumes. Sparsity thresholding was used to binarize the matrices and MATLAB functions from brain connectivity toolbox were employed to obtain the connectivity metrics. We observed PD with a significantly lower clustering coefficient as well as local efficiency at higher sparsities (above 0.9 and 0.84, respectively) with p<0.05. The right fusiform gyrus was found to be the conserved hub, besides disruption of four hubs and regeneration of five other hubs. Lower clustering coefficient and local efficiency were indicative of reduced local integration and information processing, respectively. Hence, we suggest that global clustering coefficient and local efficiency could have a pivotal role in evaluating network topology. Thereby, our findings confirmed impairment of normal structural brain network topology reflecting disconnectivity mechanisms in PD.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) promises to be an efficient and cost-effective method for promptly detecting cognitive impairment in PD. Nevertheless, prevailing diagnostic practices utilizing EEG features have failed to examine the functional connectivity among EEG channels and the response of associated brain areas causing an unsatisfactory level of precision. Here, we construct an attention-based sparse graph convolutional neural network (ASGCNN) for diagnosing PD. Our ASGCNN model uses a graph structure to represent channel relationships, the attention mechanism for selecting channels, and the L1 norm to capture channel sparsity. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available PD auditory oddball dataset, which consists of 24 PD patients (under ON/OFF drug status) and 24 matched controls, to validate the effectiveness of our method. Our results show that the proposed method provides better results compared to the publicly available baselines. The achieved scores for Recall, Precision, F1-score, Accuracy and Kappa measures are 90.36%, 88.43%, 88.41%, 87.67%, and 75.24%, respectively. Our study reveals that the frontal and temporal lobes show significant differences between PD patients and healthy individuals. In addition, EEG features extracted by ASGCNN demonstrate significant asymmetry in the frontal lobe among PD patients. These findings can offer a basis for the establishment of a clinical system for intelligent diagnosis of PD by using auditory cognitive impairment features.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3292452","Shandong First Medical University(grant numbers:YS23-0000349); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173532","Parkinson's disease (PD);electroencephalogram (EEG);graph convolutional neural Network;channel selection;asymmetry","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Electrodes;Diseases;Brain modeling;Convolution;Bioinformatics","Humans;Aged;Parkinson Disease;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Electroencephalography;Neural Networks, Computer","50","","43","IEEE","5 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Quantitative gait assessment under dual task or complex motor task (i.e., turning) may contribute to better understanding of PIGD and provide a better diagnostic indicator of early-stage PD. However, few studies have explored gait deviation evaluation algorithms under a complex dual task that reflect disease specificity. In this work, we proposed a novel inertial-based gait normalcy index (GNI) based on inertial-based quantitative gait assessment model to characterize the overall gait performance during both straight walking and turning with or without serial-3 subtraction task. The factor of group and task on the GNI variable was investigated and the feasibility of GNI to improve early-stage PD diagnostic performance was validated. The experimental results showed that the task paradigm is a significant factor on GNI performance where the dual-task GNI at turn had the best discriminating ability between early PD and HC (AUC =0.992) and was significantly correlated with UPDRS III (r =0.81), MMSE(r =0.57) and Mini-BEST(r =0.65). We also observed that the turning-based GNI has larger effect size compared to clinical scales, demonstrating that GNI during turning can reflect the changes of functional mobility in rehabilitation for the early PD.

Although there are many research work on the classification of PD and ET, they didn't achieve the automatic classification of the two diseases. But big data brings new opportunities to the classification of PD and ET. In order to achieve this, we proposed a machine learning framework which contains two parts: feature extraction and classification to achieve the classification of Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. At first, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA to extract discriminative features from structural MRI data, respectively. Then SVM classifier is employed to classify PD and ET. We used statistical analysis and machine learning method to test the differences between PD and ET in specific brain regions. As a result, the machine learning method has a better performance in extracting the differential brain regions. The highest classification accuracy is up to 93.75% in the differential brain regions.","","978-1-5090-3555-7","10.1109/CCBD.2016.075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7979933","Parkinson’s disease;essential tremor;classification;structural MRI;machine learning","Principal component analysis;Kernel;Feature extraction;Parkinson's disease;Magnetic resonance imaging;Support vector machines;Big Data","","9","","15","IEEE","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most difficult is Parkinson's disease, which is caused by the death of dopamine cells in the midbrain. Among other symptoms, Parkinson's patients usually suffer from difficulty walking. They commonly experience a phenomenon called ""freezing"" in which they don't have the ability to initiate motion to produce functional movement. Given sufficient external stimuli the same patient will be able to overcome the problem and carry out productive movements. This can then lead to them walking forward. Standard visual cues may include lines of paint or tape on the ground, but these have limitations. We have created a walker which uses a laser to project a line onto the ground in front of the patient. The patient can then step over this line. As they move the walker forward, the same stimuli is presented automatically, enabling the patient to overcome the freezing and maintain walking. Our design is effective, safe, energy conserving, low cost and can enable the mobility of Parkinson's patients and prevent the disease from reaching its extreme stage.","","978-1-4799-4097-4","10.1109/GHTC-SAS.2014.6967563","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967563","Parkinson's Disease;rehabilitation;gait;walker;laser","Legged locomotion;Parkinson's disease;Laser applications;Switches;Batteries","","5","","20","IEEE","1 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Parkinson's disease (PD) frequently causes voice changes, although some modifications may not be immediately noticeable. These modifications can impact respiration, vocal intonation, and volume by a maximum of ten decibels. Studies indicate that alterations in speech frequently manifest at an early stage in Parkinson's disease, prompting the use of a dataset comprising human voice data for assessment.

Among PD motor symptoms, gait impairments are common and evolve over time. PD motor symptoms severity can be evaluated using clinical scales such as the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS-III), which depend on the patient’s status at the time of assessment and are limited by subjectivity. Objective quantification of motor symptoms (i.e. gait) with wearable technology paired with Deep Learning (DL) techniques could help assess motor severity. The aims of this study were to: (i) apply DL techniques to wearable-based gait data to estimate MDS-UPDRS-III scores; (ii) test the DL approach on longitudinal dataset to predict the progression of MDS-UPDRSIII scores. PD gait was measured in the laboratory, during a 2 minute continuous walk, with a sensor positioned on the lower back. A DL Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on 70 PD subjects (mean disease duration: 3.5 years), validated on 58 subjects (mean disease duration: 5 years) and tested on 46 subjects (mean disease duration: 6.5 years). Model performance was evaluated on longitudinal data by quantifying the association (Pearson correlation (r)), absolute agreement (Intraclass correlation (ICC)) and mean absolute error between the predicted and true MDS-UPDRS-III. Results showed that MDS-UPDRS-III scores predicted with the proposed model, strongly correlated (r=0.82) and had a good agreement (ICC(2,1)=0.76) with true values; the mean absolute error for the predicted MDS-UPDRS-III scores was 6.29 points. The results from this study are encouraging and show that a DL-CNN model trained on baseline wearable-based gait data could be used to assess PD motor severity after 3 years.Clinical Relevance—Gait assessed with wearable technology paired with DL-CNN can estimate PD motor symptom severity and progression to support clinical decision making.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1179-7","10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9630769","","Deep learning;Correlation;Predictive models;Position measurement;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Reliability","Deep Learning;Gait;Humans;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Parkinson Disease;Wearable Electronic Devices","5","","17","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several basic mobility sub-tasks “Sit,” “Sit-to-Stand,” “Walk,” “Turn,” “Walk-Back,” and “Sit-Back” are included in a TUG test. It has been shown that the time costs of these sub-tasks are useful clinical parameters for the assessment of Parkinson’s disease. Several automatic methods have been proposed to segment and time these sub-tasks in a TUG test. However, these methods usually require either well-controlled environments for the TUG video recording or information from special devices, such as wearable inertial sensors, ambient sensors, or depth cameras. In this paper, an automatic TUG sub-task segmentation method using video-based activity classification is proposed and validated in a study with 24 Parkinson’s disease patients. Videos used in this paper are recorded in semi-controlled environments with various backgrounds. The state-of-the-art deep learning-base 2-D human pose estimation technologies are used for feature extraction. A support vector machine and a long short-term memory network are then used for the activity classification and the subtask segmentation.

We applied this method to fMRI data from Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal subjects performing a simultaneous movement task. Compared to the normal subject, the effective connectivity between motor regions was severely impaired in the PD subject, which was minimally ameliorated with L-dopa medication.

Although the exact origin of Parkinson disease is largely unknown, genetic and environmental factors are probably involved. In contrast, the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease at the network level is quite well characterized. Treatment options for Parkinson disease's motor symptoms are pretty good. Deep brain stimulation is also frequently used to treat Parkinson's disease that is resistant to medicines. Parkinson's disease can be challenging to diagnose, especially in its early stages when symptoms may be subtle. Doctors working with Parkinson's patients realized the value of the data generated during diagnosis and treatment and recognized that machine learning algorithms could help identify patterns and biomarkers that might not be apparent through traditional diagnostic methods. In this research study, first the basic clinical aspects of Parkinson disease are reviewed and then the detection or symptoms and classification of Parkinson disease have been implemented using different deep learning algorithms. Six different deep learning algorithms Naive Bayes Classifier, Minimum Distance Classifier using the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier in Logistic Regression, MLP Classifier and Decision Tree classifier have been analyzed and compared for the most optimum results for prediction of Parkinson's disease. The results show how effective and precise the deep learning algorithms are there in Parkinson disease forecasting.

Despite its significant impact on the deterioration in quality of life in PD patients, mechanistic causes of the instability have not been clarified. Joint inflexibility at ankle and hip joints might be such a major cause, leading to small variability in the center of pressure (CoP) during quiet stance. However, this conjecture is still controversial. Thus, quantitative characterization of CoP patterns during quiet stance in PD patients remains a matter of research. Here we performed a linear discriminant analysis for CoP data in PD patients and age-matched healthy elderly during quiet stance, and showed that CoP variations in PD patients and those in healthy elderly could be well distinguished with an accuracy of about 90%, to which appropriately selected sway indices characterizing aspects of power spectrum for the CoP variations contributed. Specifically, major factors responsible for the discrimination were all associated with increase in the power at a high-frequency band (near and over 1 Hz) along with reduction at the low-frequency regime (lower than about 0.7 Hz). Then, the power-ratio, defined as the relative spectral power in a band around 1 Hz, was examined, since the power in this band reflects postural sway with anti-phase coordinated motions of the ankle and hip joints. We showed that the power-ratio values were significantly smaller in the PD patients than those in the healthy subjects. This difference as well as the results of the linear discriminant analysis suggest joint inflexibility in PD patients, particularly at hip joint, which diminished anti-phase coordination between trunk and lower extremity, leading to postural instability in PD patients.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0220-4","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590632","","Senior citizens;Linear discriminant analysis;Indexes;Hip;Error analysis;Parkinson's disease;Time-frequency analysis","Aged;Ankle Joint;Case-Control Studies;Discriminant Analysis;Female;Hip Joint;Humans;Male;Parkinson Disease;Postural Balance;Posture;Pressure;Torso","11","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study uses only one motion sensor in collecting data. Thus, only fall events caused by festinating gait factors, which are moments when the patient suddenly moves faster with smaller steps, can be performed and tested. In this preliminary study, fall event scenarios of simulated test cases are performed by five healthy young subjects aged 20 to 28 years old. The acceleration mode in the motion sensor provides information that can detect how fast the subjects move. Data collected by the sensor will be analyzed by simple analysis methods and machine learning techniques classification. The proposed study achieved an accuracy of 70.3% for the 10-class model, while for binary classification, the accuracy was 99%.

Both high-density surface Electromyography (HD-sEMG) and kinematics data were collected concurrently before and after DBS surgery. The MU behaviors were obtained via HD-sEMG decomposition algorithm to reveal the effect of DBS on PD tremor. A data set of one tremor dominant PD patient acquired in pre-operation and post-operation (DBS-on) phases was analyzed. Preliminary results showed significant changes in MU firing rate and MU synchronization. The analysis approach introduced in this paper provides a novel perspective for studying the neural mechanism of DBS as revealed by MU activities. Clinical Relevance- This study presented an approach to investigate the effect of DBS therapy on improving tremor disorder of PD patients.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871976","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871976","","Parkinson's disease;Firing;Satellite broadcasting;Deep brain stimulation;Surgery;Kinematics;Electromyography","Algorithms;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electromyography;Humans;Parkinson Disease;Tremor","1","","11","IEEE","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, critical issues remain. The hierarchical organization of tests, the degree of involvement of different human subsystems, and the relationship between measures are often unclear. General Systems Performance Theory provides the basis for a novel analytic method, termed Nonlinear Causal Resource Analysis, to determine task demands (i.e., analyze tasks) and predict performance in complex tasks using only measures of lower level subsystem performance capacities. Recently, we realized new insights and discovery of a new application of these concepts to address the issues noted. A quasi-objective methodology is presented to identify hierarchical relationships among performance measures. The method is applied to seven different performance measures in a study of Parkinson's Disease subjects (n=197) exhibiting a wide range of disease severity. Resource economic interpretations of experimental data using performance theory concepts were used to define relationships between performance measures and to organize them hierarchically. This method is anticipated to have broad utility for identifying relationships between performance measures.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332761","","Parkinson's disease;Humans;Testing;Performance analysis;System performance;Economic forecasting;Medical tests;USA Councils;Biomedical monitoring;Hospitals","Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;Parkinson Disease;Task Performance and Analysis","","","17","IEEE","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Diagnosis primarily relies on identifying symptoms like shaking, stiffness, slow movements, and trouble walking. PD can also impact speech, leading to changes in breathing, vocal quality, and volume. Research suggests that alterations in speech could be an early indication of PD, motivating the use of a specialized Parkinson's dataset for speech analysis in this specific research. The research investigates the use of diverse machine learning models, such as Random Forest classification, K Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine, combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess and diagnose PD based on speech characteristics. These models demonstrate promising accuracy levels ranging from 80% to 91.5% when tested on the PD dataset.

Presently, one of the significant research fields is biomedical signal processing. Henceforth, considering vocal impairment as early signs for PD patients, diagnosis systems using vocal analysis is the need of the hour. Early detection of Parkinson's disease may aid in better diagnosis and treatment of the disease, as well as better equipping caregivers to care for the patient. Further, this may also help the hospital management centers better use their resources. This paper aims to discuss and analyze the various machine learning methods for predicting the early onset of PD. The UCI Machine Learning repository has the dataset we used in our research.

The remote monitoring of PD symptoms is practicable by analyzing the person's speech. This study demonstrates that deep learning of speech spectrum images of Running speech from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls (HC) results in a convolution neural network model with high accuracy for classifying PD. Earlier work for PD detection was totally based on the computation of speech features. Complicated speech feature computations take time and require a large amount of memory access. Using a spectrum image representation of speech in a deep convolution neural network gives very high accuracy without the need for feature computation, and selection in this work. This is possible because the convolution layer learns the features from the spectrum automatically and in this work, it is proposed to work with PD speech database for Running speech. In this case, the short time Fourier transform (STFT) is a good choice for representing speech as images. The training accuracy achieved in the experiment is 99.48% and validation accuracy are 79.10%. This method performs best and is a well-founded method for classifying PD from running speech signals.","","978-1-6654-9360-4","10.1109/ICECCT56650.2023.10179774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179774","Parkinson Disease (PD);Convolution Neural Network (CNN);Speech;Healthy Control (HC);Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT);Running Speech","Training;Learning systems;Fourier transforms;Convolution;Parkinson's disease;Neural networks;Memory management","","3","","18","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most methods can only find Parkinson's in its later stages, when about 60% of the dopamine in the basal ganglia has been lost. This tiny portion of dopamine controls how the body moves. With over 1, 45, 000 individuals have been found to have this disease in the U.K. alone, or almost a million of people have this disease in India. This disease is spreading quickly around the world.

Although traditional methods are able to provide some degree of feature interpretability, there are limitations in handling high-dimensional feature space and redundant features, resulting in decreased classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model based on artificial channel optimization, through channel selection of EEG signals recorded by 64-lead devices, screening out the optimal channel combination highly related to PD, and then achieving efficient classification. Specifically, the study uses publicly available Parkinson's disease EEG datasets, employs power spectral density (PSD) features, and combines manual channel selection with the strong classification capabilities of SVM to achieve effective classification of PD EEG signals.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-Source Transfer Learning Method Based on BP Fine-Tuning (MTL-BPFT) for continuous speech recognition in PD. Specifically, the method pre-trains a BP neural network model using multi-source fixed-text speech data, freezes lower-layer parameters to preserve domain-invariant feature extraction capabilities, and introduces dynamic pruning mechanisms alongside elastic regularization constraints to fine-tune trainable layer parameters with limited labeled target-domain data, thereby enhancing recognition accuracy in data-scarce scenarios. Experimental results on two tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves accuracies of 95.22% and 80.31%, respectively, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods and baseline approaches.

Nevertheless, there are disparities in inter-variability because these medical evaluations heavily rely on skilled physicians. Thus, this work proposes a sophisticated deep learning (DL) method for precise brain MRI-based PD analysis. To improve the data eminence, Extended Unsharp Mask Filtering (Ex_UMF) is first used to the brain images. The suggested Multi-dilated Densely linked ResNet model (MD_DenseRNet) is then fed the preprocessed pictures to determine if the image is PD or normal. The Python platform processes and examines the generated method, and the simulation progresses using a publicly available PPMI database. A number of evaluation metrics, including computing time (CT), sensitivity, specificity, and precision, are looked at and linked to conventional research. The created MD_DenseRNet model achieved 98.87% accuracy, 97% precision, 98.1% recall, 96.9% specificity, and 0.15 ms CT in the experimental part.","","979-8-3503-6408-8","10.1109/ICIC3S61846.2024.10603122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10603122","Parkinson's disease;detection process;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;neurodegenerative problems;Brain images;Extended Unsharp Masked Filtering;Multi-dilated Densely connected ResNet model","Accuracy;Sensitivity;Parkinson's disease;Computed tomography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Medical services","","","","15","IEEE","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several datasets contain incorrect values or discrepancies as a result of diagnostic procedure inconsistencies. Datasets frequently have fewer PD patients than healthy individuals, resulting in biased models. SVM is a common method for PD prediction due to its ability to handle tiny, high-dimensional data sets and its robust classification skills. SVM performs effectively even with small medical datasets, unlike deep learning models, which require enormous volumes of data. SVM minimizes overfitting, particularly when working with tiny datasets, making it more dependable for use in real-world medical settings. The study employed SVM algorithms to predict Parkinson's disease. Additionally, disease data is classified and compared using SVM with different kernel parameters. The study compares the performance of four alternative SVM models Linear SVM (LSVM), Quadratic SVM (QSVM), Cubic Gaussian SVM (CGSVM), and Medium Gaussian SVM (MGSVM) using five assessment metrics: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-Score.

Analyses of these unique data offer an important opportunity to better understand the pathophysiology of PD. Despite the point process nature of PD neural spiking activity, point process methods are rarely used to analyze these recordings. We develop a point process representation of PD neural spiking activity using a generalized linear model to describe long- and short-term temporal dependencies in the spiking activity of 28 STN neurons from seven PD patients and 35 neurons from one healthy primate (surrogate control) recorded, while the subjects executed a directed-hand movement task. We used the point process model to characterize each neuron's bursting, oscillatory, and directional tuning properties during key periods in the task trial. Relative to the control neurons, the PD neurons showed increased bursting, increased 10–30 Hz oscillations, and increased fluctuations in directional tuning. These features, which traditional methods failed to capture accurately, were efficiently summarized in a single model in the point process analysis of each neuron. The point process framework suggests a useful approach for developing quantitative neural correlates that may be related directly to the movement and behavioral disorders characteristic of PD.

The depletion of the dopaminergic signal causes the onset of motor symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. Usually, neurologists regularly monitor motor symptoms and motor fluctuations using the MDS-UPDRS part III clinical scale. Nevertheless, to have a more objective and quantitative evaluation, it is possible to assess the cardinal motor symptoms of PD using wearable sensors and portable robotic devices. Unfortunately while there are several research papers on the use of these devices on PD patients, their use is not so common in clinical practice. In this work we recorded specific MDS-UPDRS motor tasks using magneto-inertial devices, worn by seven PD subjects and seven age-matched controls, in order to deeply analyze the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of goal-directed movements of upper limb, in addition to extract quantitative indices (peak velocity, smoothness, etc) useful for the assessment of motor symptoms. Using only gyroscope signals we looked at those parameters useful to assess bradykinesia. We observed parameters changes from OFF to ON phase congruent with the MDS-UPDRS changes, especially in the frequency domain. Our results suggest the prono-supination task is the more consistent to describe the bradykinesia symptom with the gyroscopes. Probably because of the amplitude of the movement performed. Moreover the peak power looks appropriate for bradykinesia symptom evaluation.

Performances of supervised learning algorithms (i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF)) were compared on two-group and three-group classification and considering upper and lower limbs separately or together as a full system. Excellent results were obtained for healthy vs. patients classification (accuracy 1.00 for RF, and 0.97 for SVM), and good results were achieved by including IH subjects (0.92 F-measure with RF) within a three-group classification. Overall, the best performances were obtained using the full system with an RF classifier. The system is, thus, suitable to support an objective PD diagnosis. Furthermore, combining motion analysis with a validated olfactory screening test, people at risk for PD can be appropriately analyzed, and subtle changes in motor performance that characterize the prodromal phase and the early PD onset can be identified.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8856804","","Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Task analysis;Support vector machines;Olfactory;Protocols;Wearable sensors","Algorithms;Humans;Olfaction Disorders;Parkinson Disease;Support Vector Machine;Wearable Electronic Devices","5","","22","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used as an effective therapy for reducing the excessive power and synchrony observed in brain circuits, thereby ameliorating the PD symptoms. In the present study, we used a biologically plausible computational model of cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus network, which represents both healthy and PD conditions, to systematically investigate the effects of DBS frequency on the model outputs. DBS was applied to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) at different stimulation frequencies (40Hz to 300Hz). Spike train variability and spectral power in the 7-35Hz band were measured from the several nuclei represented in the model. In addition, the magnitude squared coherence between the nuclei was assessed. An increased DBS frequency tended to produce interspike intervals (ISIs) with higher variability as compared to PD condition. Also, DBS significantly reduced the alpha-beta power for almost all brain nuclei. The median of the magnitude-squared coherence matrix (which is a metric of global network synchronization) decreased significantly with the increase of DBS frequency.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176570","","Satellite broadcasting;Brain modeling;Neurons;Computational modeling;Coherence;Partial discharges;Synchronization","Basal Ganglia;Deep Brain Stimulation;Humans;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Parkinson Disease;Thalamus","4","","19","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, modern healthcare lacks the apparatus to detect the early signs of the disease, with only selected experts being able to spot the onset. Therefore, the early detection of PD is particularly important. Convolutional neural networks, a deep learning technique that can automatically extract image features, have been widely used in the diagnosis of medical images. Due to the complexity of the organization in the brain, we proposed a multiscale hybrid attention network (MSHANet) for the automatic detection of healthy and PD patients. MSHANet consisted of designed multiscale convolutional blocks and introduced hybrid attention blocks, so it can capture complex features in brain images. Two datasets were created using the images in the publicly available Parkinson’s progression markers initiative (PPMI) dataset, where the SV_3Dataset consisted of axial slices located in the substantia nigra region, and the MV_3Dataset adds mid-sagittal slices and striatal slices based on SV_3Dataset. For these two datasets, we proposed two different classification strategies, namely, parallel network classification (PNC) and multislice fusion classification (MSFC), to improve the classification performance of PD. After cross-validation experiments, the best results for the model using the PNC strategy achieved are 90.59% of accuracy, 90.59% of precision, 90.61% of recall, 90.6% of F1 score, and 0.956 of area under the curve (AUC). By analyzing the above results, the striatal slice in MV_3Dataset provides higher accuracy than the other two slices. Both PNC and MSFC improved the classification effect of MSHANet on PD and healthy control (HC), and the effect of PNC was better. The PNC strategy is used to test the performance of MSHANet on the test set. The best result is that the accuracy rate is 94.11%, the accuracy rate is 94.18%, the recall rate is 94.16, the F1 value is 94.17%, and the AUC is 0.9585. Our proposed method can help clinicians in accurately diagnosing the PD.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2023.3315407","Key Projects of Zhejiang Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism Jointly Built by Provinces and Ministries(grant numbers:2022518921); High-Quality Course for Graduate Education of Shandong Province (Digital Image Processing)(grant numbers:SDYKC19178); Undergraduate Teaching Reform Research Key Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:Z2021208); Zhejiang Medicine and Health Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:2019KY260); Zhejiang Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:LQ19H090006); Zhejiang Medicine and Health Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2018KY195); Key Research and Development Program of Shandong Province, China(grant numbers:2021CXGC010506,2021SFGC0104); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China(grant numbers:ZR2020LZH008,ZR2021MF118,ZR2022LZH003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62101311); Open Project of Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security(grant numbers:GCIS201903); Research Start-Up Funds for High-Level Recruited Talents of University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences(grant numbers:TLH2022030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254592","Classification;hybrid attention;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);multiscale;multiview image;Parkinson's disease (PD)","Magnetic resonance imaging;Feature extraction;Diseases;Parkinson's disease;Medical diagnostic imaging;Convolutional neural networks;Deep learning","","11","","41","IEEE","18 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, SWEDD is a heterogeneous group of Healthy Control (HC) and early PD subjects. Method: In this research work, we developed a Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR) method in the PD group. This process is an optimal regression model for identifying the key SPECT image-derived features, which influence clinical scores. We also investigate the interaction between these features in the three groups together (PD, SWEDD, and HC). Results: SMLR results showed that only the Specific Binding Ratio (SBR) of the Worst-Putamen and SBR of the Worst-Caudate are the factors that influence Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores, respectively. In addition, two tests of Two-Way-ANOVA showed significant interactions between UPDRS and SBR of the Worst-Putamen, and between STAI and SBR of the Worst-Caudate of the three groups.

Then, we select four parsimonious subsets of these dysphonia measures using four feature selection algorithms, and map these feature subsets to a binary classification response using two statistical classifiers: random forests and support vector machines. We use an existing database consisting of 263 samples from 43 subjects, and demonstrate that these new dysphonia measures can outperform state-of-the-art results, reaching almost 99% overall classification accuracy using only ten dysphonia features. We find that some of the recently proposed dysphonia measures complement existing algorithms in maximizing the ability of the classifiers to discriminate healthy controls from PD subjects.

However, objective extraction of appropriate features that can characterize PD symptoms faces many problems, due to the prevalence of aperiodicity in PD voices, rendering traditional perturbation analysis unreliable. The present study attempted to examine the validity of more advanced acoustic analysis techniques based on energy distribution measures and nonlinear dynamical measures. All of the features were extracted from sustained phonations of the vowel /a/ produced by 16 PD patients and 20 age-matched non- pathologic subjects. Results revealed that the energy distribution measures, such as glottal-to-noise excitation (GNE), and empirical mode decomposition excitation ratio (EMD-ER), as well as nonlinear dynamical measures including correlation dimension (D2), permutation entropy (PE), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) were effective in discerning between PD and normal voices.

The score of the word fluency test of all patients have undergone DBS surgery significantly worsened as compared with before surgery. Five patients speech ware worsened, but three patients were improved when the STN stimulation was turned OFF. On the other hand, five patients were reduced the word fluency's total score when the STN stimulation was turned OFF.

The amplitudes between N1 and P1, which are thought to originate from the cingulate cortex and the insula, were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with controls. Patients with PD showed no significant correlation between the severity of clinical parameters, such as Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale or Hoehn and Yahr score, and the amplitudes between N1 and P1. In addition, no differences were found in mean N1 or P1 latency between the two groups. These results may reflect the existence of abnormal central processing of pain inputs in PD, which appears to be independent of the clinical expression of motor dysfunction.","","978-1-4673-1618-7","10.1109/ICCME.2012.6275618","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275618","Parkinson disease;pain-related evoke potentials;intra-epidermal electrical stimulation;A delta fivers","Artificial neural networks;Epidermis;Dermis;Lasers","","","","16","IEEE","23 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of this work is therefore to verify whether PD hypomimia can be detected even from static face images. For this purpose we enrolled 50 PD patients and 50 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Parameterization based on face recognition methods in combination with conventional classifiers (random forests, XG-Boost, etc.) were used to automatically identify PD hypomimia.

However, dysphonia-changes in speech and articulation-is considered the most significant precursor as 90% of PD patients posses speech impairments. Multiple types of speech data have been used for PD detection. The multiple types of speech data includes different types of voice or speech samples for each subject, e.g., speech recordings of numbers, words, some short sentences and vowel phonations. Some of the previous studies pointed out that number samples show better performance while other concluded that vowel samples have complementary information about PD. Hence, this is still an open question that which type of speech samples contain complementary information about PD. Moreover, the drawback in these studies is that their methodology is solely based on one type of machine learning model. In this paper, we propose a more robust methodology based on multi-model framework which uses multiple types of machine learning models having diverse nature. For final evaluation of the multi-model framework, we propose to use two different evaluation criteria i.e., mean and majority voting. Based on the multi-model methodology, our study concludes that vowel samples posses complementary information for PD. Additionally, to further validate the findings of our study, we further used two other evaluation metrics namely Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) chart and area under the curve (AUC). The results of ROC charts and AUC further validated the fact that vowel samples possess complementary information regarding PD.","","978-1-7281-3825-1","10.1109/ICECCE47252.2019.8940696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8940696","Gaussian Naive Bayes;K nearest neighbours;machine learning;Parkinson's disease;support vector machine","Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Parkinson's disease;Jitter;Decision trees;Gaussian processes","","28","","21","IEEE","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ten patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD were recruited to take part in this study. Data was collected over 3 separate occasions using clinical evaluations and three-axis acceleration. In order to estimate the clinical scores associated with bradykinesia of the upper-and lower-limbs, a machine learning algorithm using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation paradigm was implemented. Using two sensors per limb did not improve estimation error within the upper-or lower-limbs. Results demonstrate that the use of multiple sensors on a single limb does not significantly improve the estimation of clinical scores related to bradykinesia.

The PD patients often fall and cause further damages to their physical conditions because of the abnormal gaits such as shuffling and festinating steps or freezing of gait. The objective behind creating a fall detection system is to provide an ambulatory gait analysis system for preventing the fall and thereby help PD patients, from further regression and physical injury due to fall. This system can also facilitate long term monitoring of motor abnormalities in PD patients during daily activities. Once the system detects abnormal gaits, auditory cues will be given to the PD patients and caregivers by their side and thus help patients prevent falls in their daily living. This paper specifies a Single Gyroscope with Standard Deviation Algorithm using data from single gyroscope attached to the shank of the body used for the detection and prevention of fall in PD patients.

Freezing of gait is associated with increased risk for falls, loss of independence, and impaired quality of life. Prediction of freezing of gait before it occurs can not only greatly improve the effect of intervention, but also avoid the occurrence of freezing to some extent. In this study, we propose an autoregressive predictive model to predict feature time series, followed by support vector machine classifier to discriminate freezing from gait sequence based on the predicted features. After extracting highly relevant features from accelerometer and gyroscope signals, we perform feature selection using correlation and maximal information coefficient to reduce the feature list to 13 candidates. The approach results in an average precision of81.61 %, recall of83.37%, accuracy of85.08%, with an expected prediction horizon of 1.63 s.

In the proposed method, gyroscope signals representing the angular rate of the feet are analyzed in the frequency domain using moving windows. A gait sequence was detected, if the frequency spectrum of a given window contained harmonic frequencies. The approach was tested on two data sets that differed in the ratio of clinical gait and cyclic movement tests. Sensitivity in both data sets was higher than 99% in a stride-to-stride comparison with ground truth. The specificity was measured with 76.1% (data set 1) and 94.5% (data set 2) for tests against sequences of other cyclic movements.

No changes were observed as for GPS, while a trend towards improvement was found in terms of GVSs of pelvis and hip on the frontal plane.

Many PD patients have Freezing of Gait (FOG). During FOG, they have difficulty to start to take a step in several seconds to over ten seconds. FOG leads to fall, and lower Quality of life due to get injured and psychological influence by anxious and fear of falling. For symptomatic relief of FOG in daily life, it is necessary to predict automatically FOG and physical intervention by wearable system without environment arrangement and human assistance. The purpose of this study is to develop a wearable gait assist system that predicts FOG episode and performs physical assistance, and to confirm the feasibility of the system through an experiment. Subjects of the system have enough muscle to walk alone in this study. For this reason, the system is single leg mechanism of exoskeleton type and a power unit is installed in a knee joint. Prediction method for FOG episode is to detect reduction of gait cycle (GC) based on peak-to-peak of toe floor reaction force. For the experiment with an able-bodied participant, the participant performed normal gait and walking with short steps. As a result, the developed system detected all of GC reduction and performed the assistance, and participant's knee joint was flexed. Therefore, we confirmed the feasibility of the developed system with the prediction method through the experiment.","","978-4-907764-50-0","10.1109/SICE.2016.7749257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7749257","Parkinson's disease;Freezing of Gait;Gait assist system;Prediction method;Gait cycle","Legged locomotion;Knee;Parkinson's disease;Torque;Gravity;Foot;Prediction methods","","2","","19","","21 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early detection of PD is important as it enables slowing or stopping its progression. Analyzing Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in blood, which may be involved in biochemical pathways specific to the disease, may reveal biomarkers that could potentially assist in early detection of PD stage and progression. VOCs can be detected by using the Solid-Phase Micro Extraction (SPME) technique, together with Gas-Chromatograph Mass Spectra (GC-MS). The output of the GC-MS is a signal with multiple peaks, where the locations of the peaks and their areas represents the various VOCs and their corresponding concentrations. In this study we have developed an algorithm for automatic analysis and processing of GC-MS signals based on VOCs in blood samples. The algorithm detects all peaks (local maxima) in this signal, with the corresponding amplitude and retention time, and computes the areas of the peaks. The algorithm aligns and groups all peaks from different samples of a similar retention time, and normalizes the areas according to internal standard area. Based on the amplitude and area, only peaks whose peak-to-noise ratio is high enough and which are substantially different from blank peaks are considered for further analysis. Two groups of rats were considered for the experimental evaluation of the algorithm: a control group of sham rats (n=9), and a second group of pre-Parkinsonian rats (n=10). A supervised learning algorithm was employed on a partial set of features to evaluate the possibility of using the areas of the peaks in order to predict whether a sample was from an intact or an impaired rat. A 6-d feature vector was constructed using the areas of peaks with large difference between groups. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation, a correct identification rate of 84.2% was achieved. Although these results are preliminary, they may indicate the potential of using the GCMS signal obtained from blood VOCs for discriminating between intact and PD induced samples.","","978-1-4799-5988-4","10.1109/EEEI.2014.7005772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005772","GC-MS signal processing;VOCs analysis;Parkinson's disease;Discriminant analysis;Supervised learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Rats;Signal processing algorithms;Blood;Standards;Parkinson's disease;Prediction algorithms","","1","","5","IEEE","12 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, PD detection based on voice signal was conducted using public dataset. Since the dataset consist of many features, the proposed method combines feature selection mechanism and classification based on Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) algorithm. Feature selection was conducted by using feature weighting from GBT.

Symptoms progress gradually and clinical diagnosis is normally possible only after symptoms have significantly progressed. Machine Learning(ML) models, which treats the diagnosis process as a binary classification problem, have been widely employed to diagnose PD. While applying ML algorithms to diagnose disease with low prevalence rate such as PD, one of the challenges that affects the accuracy of prediction is that most datasets will be imbalanced due to the practical difficulties in getting data from the patients. As a result, both classes will typically have unequal numbers of data points. In order to increase the performance of ML models dealing with an imbalanced dataset to detect PD, this research suggests incorporating the class imbalance learning technique. With normal training and class imbalance learning, five machine learning models-decision tree, K-nearest neighbour, Naive Bayes, support vector machine, and random forest-have each been individually assessed. While applying class imbalance learning, a considerable improvement in performance has been seen in each model.

Voice impairment is common symptom of PD and thus, has been selected for distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls. The GAN model allows to create synthetic data set with average generator loss of 1.661 and average discriminator loss of 0.077 which is paramount to overcome the challenge of limited and imbalanced dataset. The synthetic dataset also allows for better generalization of the model. The MLP model is designed using ReLU activation Function and Sigmoid Function for successful classification of PD patients. Batch Normalization and Dropout layers are used to overcome the challenge of overfitting and make the model more stable. The training of GAN model is done using Sakar Dataset while MLP model uses combination of synthetic data along with original data for training, testing and validation.

This study introduces a new method for the detection of PD from speech-based audio signals by leveraging Adaptive Variational Mode Decomposition (AVMD) and Random Forest (RF) classifier. The method includes advanced entropy-based features, specifically Renyi, spectral, and permutation entropy, to improve the analysis of audio signals for diagnostic purposes. The methodology involves preprocessing vocal audio data from PD patients and healthy controls, followed by feature extraction using AVMD to handle the non-stationary nature of speech. The entropy-based features are then utilized to capture the complex dynamics within these audio signals. Classification is performed using an RF classifier, which is rigorously evaluated through k-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness and reliability of the diagnostic model. The study's results are promising, with the RF classifier achieving a peak Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 78.30% for vowel E when considered independently, and an UAR of 71.88% for the combination of all five vowels. These findings indicate significant potential for this method in clinical settings.","2159-3450","979-8-3503-5082-1","10.1109/TENCON61640.2024.10902907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10902907","Parkinson's Disease;Adaptive Variational Mode Decomposition","Adaptation models;Speech analysis;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Sensitivity and specificity;Feature extraction;Entropy;Robustness;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis","","","","15","IEEE","5 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It causes anatomic modifications within the brain. There is no specific test for PD. It is still detected by identification of movement and non-movement impairments. However, in most cases, PD can only be detected at the onset of its motor symptoms which occurs at a later stage. PD when progressed ruins the patient's quality of life and makes it impossible to even perform day-to-day activities. PD causes irreversible damage to the patient's body. Therefore, early and effective PD detection is important to protect the individual from its adverse effects. This paper analyses PD detection modalities utilized by researchers like upper limb issues, gait & balance assessment, deficiency of dopamine, analysis of structural changes and pronunciation problems. Various tests related to these modalities have been identified and their corresponding issues have also been specified in this paper.

Quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis is a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for detecting brain abnormalities associated with PD. This study focusses on using regional spectral analysis of qEEG signals to identify different markers for PD. We investigated power spectral densities and connection patterns in five important brain regions: frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital region using publicly available data from 31 people, including PD patients and healthy controls. The regional irregularities are highlighted using spectral Theta/Alpha Ratio (TAR) obtained by calculating the mean relative power of alpha along with theta band. From the experimental analysis, it can be seen that TAR index is significantly higher (p<0.05) in central (p=0.0259), parietal (p=0.0002), temporal (p =0.0333) and occipital (p=0.00012) lobe of brain in PD patients with on medication state as compared to healthy individuals. Healthy and PD patients off medication showed few differences in parietal and occipital region, whereas a significant difference is reported in central, parietal and occipital region in PD patients in on and off medication states. The results demonstrate that theta/alpha ratio can be used in line with the other neuropsychological assessments to indicate and can act as a potential EEG marker to differentiate between healthy and PD patients.","","979-8-3315-2169-1","10.1109/IATMSI64286.2025.10985366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10985366","Parkinson’s Disease;Quantitative-EEG;Theta/alpha Ratio;marker;statistical significance","Technological innovation;Power measurement;Parkinson's disease;Visual impairment;Motors;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Medical diagnostic imaging;Spectral analysis;Monitoring","","","","22","IEEE","9 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To investigate the neural mechanisms related to FOG in PD, we evaluated 39 subjects (13 PD patients with FOG, 13 PD patients without FOG, and 13 healthy subjects) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals while they performed the pedaling task. We conducted functional connectivity analysis using Magnitude Squared Coherence (MSC) and calculated the metrics to investigate the characteristics of the brain network among the three groups. The results indicated that PD patients were associated with reduced functional integration and segregation of brain network, subserving both motor and cognitive abilities.

However, as the disease progresses, most patients also experience freezing of gait (FOG), a sudden, debilitating episode characterized by an inability to walk, which increases the risk of falls and injuries. Currently, no effective treatments exist for FOG, so detecting the onset of a freezing episode with sufficient lead time could enable preventative measures to avoid falls and injuries. This study proposes a method to detect the onset of FOG in PD patients by analyzing brainwave patterns from ambulatory electroen-cephalogram (EEG) signals. Our approach utilizes spectral analysis to capture frequency-specific patterns associated with both onset of FOG episodes and non-FOG. These features serve as input to a machine learning algorithm to discern subtle changes indicative of impending FOG. A dataset of EEG recordings from PD patients experiencing FOG episodes is utilized to train and validate the proposed approach. Our method achieves an AUC of 0.825, demonstrating the potential to detect the onset of FOG episodes which could pave the way for timely interventions to alleviate or prevent FOG episodes. The proposed method holds promise for enhancing the overall management and care of individuals with PD, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and a better quality of life.","2573-3028","979-8-3503-8340-9","10.1109/IECBES61011.2024.10991056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10991056","Electroencephalography;freezing of gait;Parkinson's disease;power spectral density;spectral correlation","Machine learning algorithms;Correlation;Parkinson's disease;Current measurement;Electroencephalography;Time measurement;Recording;Injuries;Spectral analysis;Biomedical engineering","","","","18","IEEE","19 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We performed a prospective crossover study of 25 PD patients attending discussion or choral-singing groups for 12 weeks each (Parkinsonics NCT02753621). Every six weeks, each participant produced several recordings of the sustained vowels /a:/ and /e:/ at ‘normal’ and ‘maximum’ loudness.

Voice features were extracted from these recordings using the Automatic Voice Condition Analysis (AVCA) library and were compared using non-parametric statistical tests. Results suggest that neither therapy caused any significant improvements in the analyzed phonatory aspects of the patients' voices.

By improving the PSO algorithm, the algorithm dynamically assigns inertia weights and learning factors, which are trained with different performances of particle, and optimizes the penalty factor and kernel function of the support vector machine to obtain the global optimal solution to improve the learning ability and performance of the support vector machine model. Finally, the algorithm proposed in this paper is applied to the data of clinical manifestations of PD, and the experiments show that the algorithm is better than the classical support vector machine algorithm based on particle swarm optimization(PSO-SVM) and the support vector machine algorithm based on genetic optimization algorithm(GA-SVM).

Recent advances in mobile IoT sensors enable the monitoring of patient activity in real time to reduce the risk of FoG episodes. The abundance of sensor data suggests a deep learning approach to predicting FoG before they occur. In this work, we propose a new algorithmic framework for FoG detection that trains on both sensor data and associated video data. Using the richness of visual data during training, we are able to derive more accurate assessments when making predictions based solely on sensor data during deployment. This method is motivated by the two-tower models that have been utilized in recommender systems and in multimodal learning.

We employed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS, current intensity: 80 μA, and 40 μA; anodal electrode area: 3.14 mm2; stimulation time: 30 minutes) over the M1 area to relieve the ipsilateral bias in the rat model. A corridor test was set to count the ipsilateral bias of the rats. In this experiment, 30 Sprague-Dawley rats (80 μA: n = 8, 40 μA: n = 8, sham: n = 7, healthy control: n = 7) were chosen for the corridor test and the tDCS session. The lesioned rats exhibited increased ipsilateral bias 4 weeks after the lesion surgery (P < 0.01), and the anodal tDCS with the active electrode on the lesioned side relieved the ipsilateral bias significantly (P < 0.01) immediately after the surgery and the improvement lasted for nearly 1 day. The rats in the group of 80 μA exhibited more significant changes than the 40 μA group after one day. After all the experiments, the histological process showed no neurotrauma led by the tDCS. In conclusion, the modulatory function of the cortical excitability of the tDCS may awaken the compensatory mechanisms and the response mechanisms which modulate the loss of the brain function. Further studies should be done to provide more evidence about the assumption.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6090175","","Rats;Lesions;Electrodes;Brain modeling;Humans;Diseases","Animals;Behavior, Animal;Electrodes;Functional Laterality;Male;Medial Forebrain Bundle;Medial Forebrain Bundle;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation;Treatment Outcome","14","","25","IEEE","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It affects the nervous system, causing motor and non-motor symptomatology. However, its clinical diagnosis remains dependent on the expertise of clinicians, as perceptual clinical scales are often used. Gait stability is one of the most relevant motor signs in PD. Nonetheless, it is usually not reported or quantified, possibly due to its unclear meaning and the high variability of metrics used in the literature. This work aims to identify a reliable and objective indicator that clinicians can use to assess patients in realistic contexts. We focused on the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE), being the most common metric used in previous research works to quantify gait stability. The short and long-term LLEs were calculated in a group of 34 healthy and 42 participants diagnosed with PD. The long-term LLE extracted from the chest, right arm and right foot sensors showed statistical differences between subjects with PD and healthy control (HC) subjects, showing that the HC subjects are more stable than PD patients, whereas the short-term LLE showed the opposite results. Further investigation is required to clarify the reliability of this metric to detect and rate gait stability in people affected with PD.Clinical Relevance— This study is the first step towards the identification of an objective methodology to assess gait stability in clinical settings. Achieving this goal will contribute to improve the understanding and support the diagnosis of gait disorders that cause gait stability problems.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10341028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341028","","Measurement;Legged locomotion;Parkinson's disease;Perturbation methods;Nervous system;Stability analysis;Sensors","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Gait;Foot;Arm","1","","21","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we focus on automating the process of diagnosis from continuous native speech by removing the necessity of a trained personal from the diagnosis process. This is done by using an adaptation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for one-dimensional signal processing (i.e. raw speech signal) on a relatively small training set.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in gait complexity and the frequency content of foot trajectories during walking between patients with PD and healthy individuals by using wavelet analyses. Fifteen persons with idiopathic PD and eleven healthy age- and height- matched healthy adults (HAs) were recruited. The foot trajectories of each subject during walking were detected by using a three-camera Optotrak Certus motion capture system. The scale wavelet energy raitos and wavelet entropy were computed after seven-scale wavelet decomposition, and the results of the two groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The results showed that, the PD subjects walked with a higher degree of complexity for the foot motion in anteroposterior direction and a lower degree of complexity for the foot motion in vertical direction. Both groups had comparable gait frequency, but the differences in the energy distributed over some frequency bands were significant between the PD and control groups.

For this purpose we used a computational model of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system (BGTCS) with parameters calculated for mean field. This model is able to reproduce both the normal and parkinsonian activities of basal ganglia, thalamus and cortex in a unified structure.

This research introduces a comprehensive benchmarking of nine unified models, and a unique contribution of this research is the adaptation of the Tabular Transformer model for structured medical data, achieving an unprecedented accuracy of 99.49%, setting a new benchmark for Parkinson's disease classification. The proposed approach provides an advanced, adaptable framework that supports clinicians in making early, accurate diagnoses, ultimately improving patient care.

The study evaluates nine models: SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, KNN, CNN, and Tabular Transformer, achieving improved accuracy across all models compared to previous studies, marking a notable advancement in Parkinson's disease classification performance. The Transformer's attention mechanism captures intricate data patterns, providing clear advantages over traditional approaches and improving diagnostic precision for early-stage Parkinson's detection. Data preprocessing included the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for class balancing and feature standardization, with each model, from SVM and Decision Trees to CNN and XGBoost, optimized through Optuna for optimal performance.

PD rendered dopamine-producing neurons dead which ultimately leads to a reduction in a variety of motor activities. Patients can have their quality of life improved by receiving an accurate diagnosis and preventative therapy. The primary criteria for diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) are medical indicators, particularly motor symptoms. However, traditional diagnostic procedures for PD can be subjective and prone to misdiagnosis due to the difficulty in categorizing small movements accurately. By improving medical professionals' ability to classify Parkinson's disease (PD), this study hopes to expedite the treatment process for those who suffer from it. To select the superior machine learning method, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR). To categorize data, this study employs three well-known methods: the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and the Decision Tree. Research used datasets that contained both patients with and without Parkinson's disease for both the training and testing phases of the study. This research suggests significant implications for subtyping Parkinson's disease. A similar level of accuracy (83.05%) is reached by the ICA-SVM model as well as the ICA-KNN model. The ICA-Decision Tree model's classification accuracy of 81.36 percent is also quite good. These results provide new avenues for exploring how machine learning might be used to better categorize people with Parkinson's. Bringing attention to these cutting-edge models is important to us because of their potential to boost diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in Parkinson's disease.","","979-8-3503-5815-5","10.1109/SEB4SDG60871.2024.10629707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10629707","Parkinson's disease classification;Machine learning models;MRMR feature selection;ICA dimensionality reduction","Support vector machines;Dimensionality reduction;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Medical treatment;Nearest neighbor methods;Predictive models","","1","","23","IEEE","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study utilized an ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) technique to investigate the brain dynamic changes underlying GIF and aims to detect the occurrence of GIF in four PD patients. We sought to determine whether episodes of GIF might be associated with a characteristic brain signal that could be detected by surface EEG. This preliminary investigation analyzed the EEG signals through power spectra density (PSD) and centroid frequency (CF) to show that the GIF episodes were associated with significant increases in the high beta band (21–38Hz) across the central, frontal, occipital and parietal EEG sites. By implementing PSD and CF as input features with two-layer Back Propagation neural networks as a classifier, the proposed system was able to detect GIF events with a classification performance of 84.27% sensitivity and 84.80% accuracy.

In cases when no effective therapies exist, machine learning mPDe provides a means of making an early diagnosis and thereby improving patient outcomes. A loss of brain function, like in the case of Dementia, impairs the ability of the rest of the body to function normally. In medicine, the application of machine learning models is known as “quantum intelligence,” and it is used to determine which drug combinations work best. In terms of technology and automation, quantum computing or intelligence is among the highest. We're attempting to apply quantum intelligence to a dataset about Parkinson's disease. Models of machine learning and deep learning, such as random forests, decision trees, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and so on, are applied to a variety of generic datasets. OASIS is a specialized neuroimaging dataset with a variety of MRI patient dimensions. This can be incorporated into future studies. We are employing 3D brain pictures to diagnose the tumour using machine learning models, and MRI has multiple facets to be taken into account before arriving at a diagnosis.

The aim of the present study was to design a reliable automatic approach for the precise estimation of articulatory deficits in PD. Twenty-four individuals diagnosed with de novo PD and twenty-two age-matched healthy controls were recruited. Each participant performed diadochokinetic tasks based upon the fast repetition of /pa/-/ta/-/ka/ syllables. All phonemes were manually labeled and an algorithm for their automatic detection was designed. Subsequently, 13 features describing six different articulatory aspects of speech including vowel quality, coordination of laryngeal and supralaryngeal activity, precision of consonant articulation, tongue movement, occlusion weakening, and speech timing were analyzed. In addition, a classification experiment using a support vector machine based on articulatory features was proposed to differentiate between PD patients and healthy controls. The proposed detection algorithm reached approximately 80% accuracy for a 5 ms threshold of absolute difference between manually labeled references and automatically detected positions. When compared to controls, PD patients showed impaired articulatory performance in all investigated speech dimensions ( $p < 0.05$). Moreover, using the six features representing different aspects of articulation, the best overall classification result attained a success rate of 88% in separating PD from controls. Imprecise consonant articulation was found to be the most powerful indicator of PD-related dysarthria.

Many research works in PD management discuss the challenges that healthcare professionals face in the early detection and management of this disease. Sensor devices have been promising to overcome these challenges to a certain degree because of the low cost and accuracy in measurement, yielding precise conclusive results to detect, monitor, and manage PD. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides an in-depth analysis of the PD symptoms, Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS), the current diagnosis and management techniques used and their efficacy. The paper also highlights the work of various researchers in wearable sensors and their proposals to improve the quality of life of a PD patient by diagnosing, monitoring, and managing PD symptoms remotely via wearable sensors. Another area of focus is commercially available wearables for PD management and a few promising works in progress. This paper will be beneficial for future researchers to identify existing gaps and provide the clinicians better insight into the disease progression, and avoid complications. This paper analyzes around 50+ articles from 2016 to 2021 and concludes that there is still much room for improvement in wearables for PD management during the research process. While much work has been attributed to PD Motor Symptom management, there is little focus on the management of PD NMS via wearable sensors. Furthermore, this paper also presents future work for PD management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3162844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743908","Parkinson’s;wearable sensors;tremors;gait disturbances;sleep dysfunction;remote monitoring;freezing of gait (FoG);depression;cognition;machine learning;early detection","Diseases;Wearable sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Medical diagnostic imaging;Depression;Machine learning;Cognition;Parkinson's disease;Gain measurement;Wearable devices","","85","","111","CCBY","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, different people experience different symptoms and different levels of severity of PD. This paper proposes a multimodal approach combining voice and image test to enhance the reliability of detecting PD patients. To substantiate this idea, we have evaluated both voice and spiral test data using various machine learning models. The results based on the two types of dataset demonstrate an excellent level of accuracy for PD identification. Pairwise correlation and k-means clustering techniques are used to extract features from the vocal dataset. In this classification problem, the highest accuracy of 95.89% is obtained using an ensemble of 3 classification models. The Pearson's correlation is used to extract features from the image dataset. The best accuracy of 99.6% is achieved using the k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). An accuracy of 98.8% and 94.9% are achieved using the Logistic Regression classifier and the Adaptive Boosting classifier on the Static Spiral Test (SST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP), respectively. A second ensemble making use of results from DST, SST, and STCP will provide the overall result of the spiral test. We also implement the multi-modal approach into a touch-enabled smartphone-based application to carry out preliminary PD tests conveniently, without the need of supervision of additional medical personnel or any specialized equipment. The final ensemble for the application makes use of the results of the respective ensemble from the vocal and spiral tests.","2325-0925","978-1-7281-0525-3","10.1109/ICSSE.2019.8823309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8823309","—Parkinson disease detection;pairwise correlation;k-mean;ensemble;vocal test;sprial test","Spirals;Feature extraction;STEM;Parkinson's disease;Jitter;Correlation","","15","","20","IEEE","5 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the clinical assessment tasks to diagnose and stage PD from hand impairment, the Finger Tapping (FT) task is a well-established tool. This preliminary study exploits a single RGB-Depth camera (Azure Kinect) and Google MediaPipe Hands to track and assess the Finger Tapping task. The system includes several stages. First, hand movements are tracked from FT video recordings and used to extract a series of clinically-relevant features. Then, the most significant features are selected and used to train and test several Machine Learning (ML) models, to distinguish subjects with PD from healthy controls. To test the proposed system, 35 PD subjects and 60 healthy volunteers were recruited. The best-performing ML model achieved a 94.4% Accuracy and 98.4% Fl score in a Leave-One-Subject-Out validation. Moreover, different clusters with respect to spatial and temporal variability in the FT trials among PD subjects were identified.

Therefore, these two symptoms can be used in detecting PD in the early stages. The utilization of computer-aided approaches in PD diagnosis has improved worldwide over the last few years. Among these techniques, Machine Learning (ML) models have proven a promising success in PD diagnosis.

Amongst several biological and environmental factors, studies have shown a link between the incidence of PD to the exposure of chemicals found in herbicides such as Paraquat. In the present research, Caenorhabditis elegans has been chosen as the model system to study the effect of Paraquat. The organism has a simple brain anatomy and a small neuronal count. Plant-based medications from legumes containing Levodopa, a precursor of dopamine have been used for many years as the treatment for PD. This aids in restoring the levels of dopamine in the brain. The PD in C. elegans was induced by exposing the organism to various concentrations of Paraquat in the laboratory. In-silico experiments such as docking, ADMET, physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were conducted for Paraquat and Levodopa using Swiss ADME and pkCSM (Predicting Small-Molecule Pharmacokinetic and Toxicity Properties Using Graph-Based Signatures). The molecular docking for receptors human Leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) and its analog in C. elegans, Leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase-I(LRK1) against the ligands Paraquat and Levodopa is reported. The ligand was docked into the binding site of the receptor and their interaction energies were calculated using binding energy. Further, the complexes were visualized using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer. The LD50 of Paraquat on C. elegans was tested and the movement analysis was done using the image processing tool, Image.J, It was found that the LD50 for an interval of 3 hours was 0.1M. The movement analysis using ImageJ revealed the length and the distance traveled per second by the worm. It was observed that, with the increase in the concentration of Paraquat, the movement was affected. The distance traveled by the worm in 0.1M Paraquat at 0 hours was 192.80 μm and at 3 hours was 88.37 μm, The study provides insights into the toxic effects of Paraquat on C. elegans, especially concerning its behavior and movement. Also, the results obtained from In-silico studies demonstrate that Levodopa could be used as potential therapeutics in the treatment of PD. These findings contribute to an understanding of the potential link between herbicide exposure and the development of PD.","2471-7819","979-8-3503-9311-8","10.1109/BIBE60311.2023.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10431831","Parkinson's disease;Paraquat;C. elegans;LD50;Molecular Docking;Discovery studio;Image analysis;Levodopa","Drugs;Visualization;Toxicology;Parkinson's disease;Organisms;Behavioral sciences;Pharmacokinetics","","2","","26","IEEE","19 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spiral analysis is a method of analyzing the drawing of Archimedean spiral to quantify motor activity and evaluate the possible movement disorder symptom such as tremor, an involuntary trembling or shaking movements in one or more parts of the body. One of the most common degenerative disorders of the central nervous system that causes the tremor is Parkinson's disease (PD). It is usually a slowly progressing disease which affects the patient with the following symptoms: tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and postural instability. Clinical observation is needed to diagnose the tremor, which requires a trained specialist. Thus, an additional method is desirable to help in the diagnosis process and possibly improve the early detection as well as the measurement of disease severity. Many studies have reported that the spiral analysis may be useful in the diagnosis of motor dysfunction in PD and other movement disorder patients. Moreover, the spiral drawing test can easily be performed using a mobile tablet from anywhere not limited to a hospital.

The BWSTI provides a safe and controlled walking platform which allows investigators to assess gait impairments under various conditions that simulate real life. In order to be able to evoke FOG, our BWSTI employed a novel speed adaptation controller, which allows patients to drive the treadmill speed. Our interface responsively follows the subject's intention of changing walking speed by the combined use of feedback and feedforward controllers. To provide realistic visual stimuli, a three dimensional VR system is interfaced with the speed adaptation controller and synchronously displays realistic visual cues. The VR-based BWSTI was tested with three patients with PD who are known to have FOG. Visual stimuli that might cause FOG were shown to them while the speed adaptation controller adjusted treadmill speed to follow the subjects' intention.

Research into the topic of ""voice features for Parkinson's (PD) detection"" looks into viability of using voice recordings for Parkinson's disease screening or treatment. PD patients may have certain patterns in their vocal characteristics, such as variations in pitch, loudness, and speech rhythm. Examining these aspects of speech could reveal important information on the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease. Voice analysis's potential as a Parkinson's disease diagnosis tool has been examined in a number of studies. These investigations frequently use machine. Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely applied in these studies to evaluate voice recordings and extract pertinent information. This work investigates the use of voice features in machine learning (ML) algorithms for PD identification.

PD reduces the control of vocal tract muscles such as the tongue and lips and, therefore the length of the active vocal tract is altered. However, the change in the vocal tract length due to the disease has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the difference in the apparent vocal tract length (AVTL) between people with PD and age-matched control healthy people. The phoneme, /a/ from the UCI Parkinson’s Disease Classification Dataset and the Italian Parkinson’s Voice and Speech Dataset were used and AVTL was calculated based on the first four formants of the sustained phoneme (F1-F4). The results show a correlation between Parkinson’s disease and an increase in vocal tract length. The most sensitive feature was the AVTL calculated using the first formants of sustained phonemes (F1). The other significant finding reported in this article is that the difference is significant and only appeared in the male participants. However, the size of the database is not sufficiently large to identify the possible confounding factors such as the severity and duration of the disease, medication, age, and comorbidity factors.Clinical relevance—The outcomes of this research have the potential to improve the identification of early Parkinsonian dysarthria and monitor PD progression.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340263","","Tongue;Correlation;Databases;Lips;Muscles;Larynx;Biomedical monitoring","Humans;Male;Parkinson Disease;Voice;Dysarthria;Speech","3","","31","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Timely intervention and individualized treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) depend on an early and correct diagnosis. In recent times, there has been the emergence of potential methods for enhancing PD diagnosis, including Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Quantum Machine Learning (QML). This work provides a detailed analysis of the state of machine learning, deep learning and quantum machine learning based Parkinson's disease diagnosis. It focuses on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), handwriting, voice, and wave spiral datasets. Previous research has some restrictions and difficulties, but these can be addressed by using quantum machine learning on the Parkinson's dataset, which can be based on both non-motor and motor symptoms. According to this study, detecting Parkinson's disease with quantum machine learning will require specialized knowledge and additional resources, which will be highly expensive. In future, we can use machine learning techniques, like ensemble approaches, as the conclusion suggests and with the use of performance indicators such as F-Beta score, recall, accuracy, and precision, etc., we can improve the model's correctness. By providing guidance for the creation of ML and DL-based methods for PD identification, this study acts as a road map for future research. As we gain a better understanding of PD diagnosis and eventually improve patient outcomes, it is anticipated to be beneficial to both the scientific community and medical professionals.","","979-8-3315-1859-2","10.1109/DELCON64804.2024.10867153","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10867153","Parkinson's disease;dopamine;machine learning;deep learning","Deep learning;Spirals;Parkinson's disease;Magnetic resonance imaging;Soft sensors;Roads;Machine learning;Motors;Prognostics and health management;Medical diagnostic imaging","","1","","42","IEEE","11 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these studies have not considered patient perceptual ability based on the tested time scale, even though the BG's postulated influence on temporal processing is limited to certain time scales. Furthermore, it is not clear what effect Levodopa medication has on temporal perception for PD patients. This study examines the perception of vision-based temporal perception in different time scales for PD patients, and the effect of Levodopa medication via a two-forced alternative choice task using a computer-generated graphical tool. For this, perceptual ability (quantified using the subject's difference threshold obtained through cumulative Gaussian functions) of 21 patients with PD was evaluated OFF and ON Levodopa medication, compared to 17 age-matched healthy participants. Individuals with PD displayed no impairments in perceiving time in the range of milliseconds, however in the range of seconds temporal perception was significantly impaired. This provides evidence for current timing models involving cerebellar control for millisecond timing, and BG influenced timing in the range of seconds to minutes.

It affects the dopamine transporter (DAT) system, and results in a reduction of DAT specific binding and volume of active dopamine transporters, in the striata. Early detection of PD, before the onset of clinical symptoms, has great potential in improving patient management. Dual-isotope SPECT allows the assessment of different brain functions under identical physiological conditions. Simultaneous dual-isotope studies have a further advantage over sequential studies as they provide perfect image registration and reduce imaging time for the same total collected counts. These advantages are limited however by cross-talk and downscatter between the two isotopes, especially in the case of 123I and 99mTc where the emission energies are very close (i.e., 159 and 140 keV). We compare DAT brain PET with sequential and simultaneous pre- and post-synaptic dual-isotope SPECT for the task of estimating striatal activity concentration and striatal size for a normal brain and for three early stages of PD. We used the Cramer-Rao lower bound, representing the theoretical best performance achievable, as our performance metric to objectively compare these modalities, and determine their performance in identifying early disease stages. Our findings show that PET and simultaneous and sequential SPECT can successfully identify the early stages of PD when estimating both pre-synaptic activity concentration and size. Post-synaptic SPECT imaging was not able to separate disease stages. PET and simultaneous SPECT perform well when estimating only activity concentration or size, but sequential SPECT has significantly degraded performance due to lower statistics.","1082-3654","978-1-4244-0922-8","10.1109/NSSMIC.2007.4436906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4436906","","Positron emission tomography;Legged locomotion;Isotopes;Measurement;Nuclear and plasma sciences;Parkinson's disease;Image registration;Degradation;Statistics;Spatial resolution","","1","","17","IEEE","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Speech production is a complex neuromuscular task that get affected due to ND diseases. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of speech analysis in the classification of ND diseases focusing on PD. In the literature, existing methodologies in speech analysis using signal processing aim at extraction and usage of features to capture perturbations due to PD. A novel methodology is proposed in this paper that extracts features at a pitch synchronous level from the speech. Instead of the average, variance in these features at a syllabic level is used for classification. An unsupervised k-means clustering algorithm is used to perform classification. Feature selection based on statistical testing is performed to address dimensionality problem.

This paper presents a novel approach for diagnosing PD using speech sounds, utilizing a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The utilization of CWT was employed to obtain the time-frequency representation (TFR) for each voice recording. From the TFR, entropy and energy are calculated for every frequency component and used as features for the classification of PD-affected speech and healthy individuals' speech. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified using the vowels of the GITA database. The support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) are used as a classifier for the classification.

It is associated with pathological, oscillatory neural activity in the basal ganglia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is often successfully used to treat medically refractive Parkinson's disease. However, the selection of stimulation parameters is based on qualitative assessment of the patient, which can result in a lengthy tuning period and a suboptimal choice of parameters. This study explores fourth-order, control theory-based models of oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia. Describing function analysis is applied to examine possible mechanisms for the generation of oscillations in interacting nuclei and to investigate the suppression of oscillations with high-frequency stimulation. The theoretical results for the suppression of the oscillatory activity obtained using both the fourth-order model, and a previously described second-order model, are optimized to fit clinically recorded local field potential data obtained from Parkinsonian patients with implanted DBS. Close agreement between the power of oscillations recorded for a range of stimulation amplitudes is observed ($R^{2}=0.69-0.99$ ). The results suggest that the behavior of the system and the suppression of pathological neural oscillations with DBS is well described by the macroscopic models presented. The results also demonstrate that in this instance, a second-order model is sufficient to model the clinical data, without the need for added complexity. Describing the system behavior with computationally efficient models could aid in the identification of optimal stimulation parameters for patients in a clinical environment.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2475166","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:10/RFP/ECE2720); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7230262","Basal ganglia;mean field model;Parkinson’s disease;pathological oscillations;control theory;Basal ganglia;control theory;mean field model;Parkinson's disease;pathological oscillations","Oscillators;Satellite broadcasting;Parkinson's disease;Mathematical model;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Data models","Basal Ganglia;Deep Brain Stimulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Parkinson Disease","26","","58","IEEE","31 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents algorithms to process IMU data, to detect and segment unstructured ADL in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) in simulated free-living environment. The proposed method enabled the detection of 1610 events of ADL performed by nine community dwelling older adults with PD under simulated free-living environment with 90% accuracy (sensitivity = 90.8%, specificity = 97.8%) while segmenting these activities within 350 ms of the “gold-standard” manual segmentation. These results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method to eventually be used to automatically detect and segment ADL in free-living environment in people with PD.

The early diagnosis of PD is very important for potential patients to receive prompt treatment and avoid the aggravation of the disease. Recent studies have found that PD patients always suffer from emotional expression disorder, thus forming the characteristics of “masked faces”. Based on this, we thus propose an auto PD diagnosis method based on mixed emotional facial expressions in the paper. Specifically, the proposed method is cast into four steps: Firstly, we synthesize virtual face images containing six basic expressions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) via generative adversarial learning, in order to approximate the premorbid expressions of PD patients; Secondly, we design an effective screening scheme to assess the quality of the above synthesized facial expression images and then shortlist the high-quality ones; Thirdly, we train a deep feature extractor accompanied with a facial expression classifier based on the mixture of the original facial expression images of the PD patients, the high-quality synthesized facial expression images of PD patients, and the normal facial expression images from other public face datasets; Finally, with the well-trained deep feature extractor, we thus adopt it to extract the latent expression features for six facial expression images of a potential PD patient to conduct PD/non-PD prediction. To show real-world impacts, we also collected a new facial expression dataset of PD patients in collaboration with a hospital. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for PD diagnosis and facial expression recognition.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3239780","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271239,61971352); Blue Sky Research Fund of HKBU(grant numbers:BSRF/21-22/16); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515110692); Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo(grant numbers:2021J048,2021J049); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025686","Parkinson's disease diagnosis;generative adversarial learning;deep learning;image quality assessment;facial expression recognition","Feature extraction;Image quality;Generative adversarial networks;Adversarial machine learning;Parkinson's disease;Deep learning;Emotion recognition","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Deep Learning;Facial Expression;Emotions;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Male;Female;Databases, Factual;Aged","26","","78","IEEE","25 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a fine motor function assessment framework for capturing transient DBS-induced changes. The main goals are to obtain a fast, repeatable, objective, robust, and DBS-sensitive motor-score, in addition to a high-dimensional characterization of motor components by means of an interpretable data-driven model. To achieve this, we combine a hand motor-task, termed the copy-draw test, with a linear model for analyzing features extracted from the proposed task. The approach was tested with four patients totaling eight sessions analyzed. Our approach delivers a motor-score that is sensitive to DBS-induced changes in motor function. It can be applied repeatedly within seconds. The interpretability of the underlying machine learning model provides a direct overview of the feature relevance. This analysis allows to detect and characterize single movement components that are sensitive to DBS.

Optimal functioning of SMI is essential for perceiving the environment, modulating the motor outputs, and learning or modifying motor skills to suit the demands of the environment. Growing evidence suggests that patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may suffer from an impairment in SMI that contributes to perceptual deficits, leading to motor abnormalities. However, the exact nature of the SMI impairment is still unclear. This study uses a robot-assisted assessment tool to quantitatively characterize SMI impairments in PD patients and how they affect voluntary movements. A set of assessment tasks was developed using a robotic manipulandum equipped with a virtual-reality system. The sensory conditions of the virtual environment were varied to facilitate the assessment of SMI. A hundred PD patients (before and after medication) and forty-three control subjects completed the tasks under varying sensory conditions. The kinematic measures obtained from the robotic device were used to evaluate SMI. The findings reveal that across all sensory conditions, PD patients had 36% higher endpoint error, 38% higher direction error in reaching tasks, and 43% higher number of violations in tracing tasks than control subjects due to impairment in integrating sensory inputs. However, they still retained motor learning ability and the ability to modulate motor outputs. The medication worsened the SMI deficits as PD patients, after medication, performed worse than before medication when encountering dynamic sensory environments and exhibited impaired motor learning ability.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3299884","Mitacs Accelerate Program(grant numbers:R2881A07); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN-1345); Tier-1 Canada Research Chairs Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196468","Sensorimotor integration;Parkinson’s disease;KINARM endpoint robot","Robot sensing systems;Task analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Feature extraction;Visualization;Parkinson's disease;Testing","Parkinson Disease;Humans;Male;Female;Middle Aged;Robotics;Machine Learning;Task Performance and Analysis","5","","36","CCBY","28 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the post-operative optimization (aimed at maximizing patient clinical benefits and minimizing adverse effects) of all possible DBS parameter settings using the standard-of-care clinical protocol requires numerous clinical visits, which substantially increases the time to optimization per patient (TPP), patient cost burden and limit the number of patients who can undergo DBS treatment. The TPP is further elongated in electrodes with stimulation directionality or in diseases with latency in clinical feedback. In this work, we proposed a deep learning and fMRI-based pipeline for DBS optimization that can potentially reduce the TPP from ~1 year to a few hours during a single clinical visit.Methods and procedures: We developed an unsupervised autoencoder (AE)-based model to extract meaningful features from 122 previously acquired blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) fMRI datasets from 39 a priori clinically optimized PD patients undergoing DBS therapy. The extracted features are then fed into multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based parameter classification and prediction models for rapid DBS parameter optimization.Results: The AE-extracted features of optimal and non-optimal DBS were disentangled. The AE-MLP classification model yielded accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and combined AUC of 0.96 ± 0.04, 0.95 ± 0.07, 0.92 ± 0.07, 0.93 ± 0.06, and 0.98 respectively.

About 50% of patients with advanced PD develop a debilitating symptom called freezing of gait (FOG), which has been linked to force control problems in the lower limbs, and some may only have a limited response to the gold standard pharmaceutical therapy, levodopa, resulting in partially levodopa-responsive FOG (PLR-FOG). There has been limited research on investigating upper-limb force control in people with PD with PLR-FOG, and without FOG. In this pilot study, force control was explored using an upper-and-lower-limb haptics-enabled robot in a reaching task while people with PD with and without PLR-FOG were on their levodopa medication. A healthy control group was used for reference, and each cohort completed the task at three different levels of assistance provided by the robot. Similar significant proportional force control deficits were found in the upper and lower limbs in patients with PLR-FOG versus those without FOG. Some aspects of force control were found to be retained, including an ability to increase or decrease force in response to changes in resistance while completing a reaching task. Overall, these results suggest there are force control deficits in both the upper and lower limbs in people with PLR-FOG.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3355429","Collaborative Health Research Projects (CHRP)(grant numbers:316170 (Patel)); Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; AGE-WELL Network of Centres of Excellence(grant numbers:AW CRP 2015-WP5.3 (Patel)); Canada Research Chairs Program (Patel); Parkinson Canada Graduate Student Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10403848","Force control;freezing of gait;haptics;Parkinson's disease;visuomotor control","Force;Task analysis;Robots;Force control;Force measurement;Timing;Particle measurements","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Levodopa;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Pilot Projects;Gait","2","","45","CCBY","18 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, a novel multi-output random forest algorithm is used as one hurdle of the double-hurdle model, further enhancing the model's performance. We conduct six experiments on a public PD gait database. Results demonstrate that the designed random forest algorithm in the double-hurdle model–hyperparameter independence framework achieves outstanding performances with the highest correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.972 and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.488.

Currently, there is no definite cure for PD, and available treatments mainly aim to alleviate its symptoms. Due to impaired neurotransmitter-based information transmission in PD, molecular communication-based approaches can be employed as potential solutions to address this issue. Molecular Communications (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method utilizing molecules to carry information. This mode of communication stands out for developing bio-compatible nanomachines for diagnosing and treating, particularly in addressing neurodegenerative diseases like PD, due to its compatibility with biological systems. This study presents a novel treatment method that introduces an Intelligent Dopamine Rate Modulator (IDRM), which is located in the synaptic gap between the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and striatum to compensate for insufficiency dopamine release in BG caused by PD. For storing dopamine in the IDRM, dopamine compound (DAC) is swallowed and crossed through the digestive system, blood circulatory system, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and brain extracellular matrix uptakes with IDRMs. Here, the DAC concentration is calculated in these regions, revealing that the required exogenous dopamine consistently reaches IDRM. Therefore, the perpetual dopamine insufficiency in BG associated with PD can be compensated. This method reduces drug side effects because dopamine is not released in other brain regions. Unlike other treatments, this approach targets the root cause of PD rather than just reducing symptoms.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2024.3456031","AXA Research Fund (AXA Chair for Internet of Everything at Koç University); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10679702","Molecular communication;Parkinson’s disease;drug delivery system;dopamine;neurotransmitter","Neurons;Medical treatment;Basal ganglia;Molecular communication;Neurotransmitters;Parkinson's disease;Drug delivery","Parkinson Disease;Dopamine;Animals;Humans","","","44","IEEE","12 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are six main symptoms: tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia (slow movements), hand asymmetry, posture instability and freezing of gait. Nowadays any type of diagnose for this disorder is done through observation by a health care professional specialized in this area. Therefore a simpler and more efficient method that General Practioners can use to have some grounded information to decide to forward a possible patient to a specialist is needed. With this in mind different systems were studied coming to the conclusion that a mobile application is among the best options. This work can be split in four important phases (see Figure 1): (1) study of the current market for this problem and for the solution to be developed, (2) development of a smartphone application capable of gathering data of the early symptoms of Parkinson's taking into consideration all the smartphone's specifications; (3) use the application to gather data from real patients and a control group and (4) test and select a classification algorithm. The first phase involved two research topics: problem and solution. The problem consisted in studying all the symptoms that could theoretically be detected by the different smartphone components. The solution consisted in studying the different methods used to solve such a problem using data mining techniques (different feature selection and classification algorithms that best take advantage of the nature of the data gathered). The second phase consisted in the development of the smartphone application with four components (spiral analysis, tap analysis, simple questions and gait analysis). The third phase was dedicated in building the control group gathering data from healthy people and a Parkinson patients group for a total of 35 subjects. Finally, the fourth phase was using the studied algorithms to filter the different features and compare the different algorithms selected. With the available data from the test subjects it was possible to achieve promising results from the gait analysis of the patients where the pelvic sway was a good feature to help differentiate Parkinson patients from healthy ones.","","978-1-4799-2921-4","10.1109/MeMeA.2014.6860027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6860027","Parkinson;diagnostic;mobile;data mining","Spirals;Parkinson's disease;Classification algorithms;Fingers;Games;Legged locomotion;Medical diagnostic imaging","","12","","22","IEEE","24 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This space of the brain develops a neurotransmitter known as dopamine, which is generated by nerve cells. Dopamine has the crucial role of a messenger between brain and certain parts of the nervous system that are having crucial role in body movements. As dopamine is distributed more widely, neurons in the parts have difficulties speaking, writing, walking, and performing other simple activities. Approximately 90% of persons with Parkinson's disease experience one or more of tremors, gait imbalance and speech problems. Around the age 70 is of onset, and the occurrence increases dramatically as one gets older. However, only a tiny percentage of patients with PD get the condition even before age of 50. PD affects more than ten million people globally. There is presently no treatment is available to cure the Parkinson's disease, but research is ongoing, and medications or surgery can help with motor symptoms in some cases. PD is one of the most disturbing diseases. As a result, early detection may assist to prevent or mitigate the symptoms.

It involves a gradual degeneration of the dopamine-producing neurons and is a main neuropathological characteristic of PD. The post-translational modifications of the proteins tend to crosstalk between one another which might play a significant role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Lysine residues on proteins undergo post-translational modifications (PTM) like acetylation and ubiquitination, and these post-translational modifications drive vital cellular functions like transcriptional regulation, autophagy, and in the clearing of the misfolded proteins aggregates by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and thus plays a vital role in the degradation of such toxic protein aggregates and also the metabolites toxins present in cells, where some deviation in UPS is generally reported to involve in the Parkinson's Disease (PD). Also, the addition of the acetyl group in lysine and removal of the acetyl group of several proteins, including some proteins like histones and non-histone, might be tightly linked with Parkinson's Disease etiology. But crosstalk between these two PTMs is poorly understood.

This study investigates the application of general human motion encoders trained on large-scale human motion datasets for analyzing gait patterns in PD patients. Although these models have learned a wealth of human biomechanical knowledge, their effectiveness in analyzing pathological movements, such as parkinsonian gait, has yet to be fully validated. We propose a comparative framework and evaluate six pre-trained state-of-the-art human motion encoder models on their ability to predict the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) gait scores from motion capture data. We compare these against a traditional gait feature-based predictive model in a recently released large public PD dataset, including PD patients on and off medication. The feature-based model currently shows higher weighted average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Motion encoder models with closely comparable results demonstrate promise for scalability and efficiency in clinical settings. This potential is underscored by the enhanced performance of the encoder model upon fine-tuning on PD training set. Four of the six human motion models examined provided prediction scores that were significantly different between on- and off-medication states. This finding reveals the sensitivity of motion encoder models to nuanced clinical changes, emphasizing their potential utility in clinical settings. It also underscores the necessity for continued customization of these models to better capture disease-specific features, thereby reducing the reliance on labor-intensive feature engineering. Lastly, we establish a benchmark for the analysis of skeleton-based motion encoder models in clinical settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a benchmark that enables state-of-the-art models to be tested and compete in a clinical context.

Dopaminergic treatment in PD can induce abnormal involuntary movements, including choreatic dyskinesia (brief, rapid, irregular movements). Adjustments in medication to reduce LID often sacrifice control of motor symptoms, and balancing this tradeoff poses a significant challenge for management of advanced PD. Fifteen PD subjects with known LID were recruited and instructed to perform two stationary motor tasks while wearing a compact wireless motion sensor unit positioned on each hand over the course of a levodopa dose cycle. Videos of subjects performing the motor tasks were later scored by expert clinicians to assess global dyskinesia using the modified Abnormal Involuntary Rating Scale (m-AIMS). Kinematic features were extracted from motion data in different frequency bands (1-3Hz and 3-8Hz) to quantify LID severity and to distinguish between LID and PD tremor. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine thresholds for individual features to detect the presence of LID. A sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 1.00 were achieved. A neural network was also trained to output dyskinesia severity on a 0 to 4 scale, similar to the m-AIMS. The model generalized well to new data (coefficient of determination= 0.85 and mean squared error= 0.3).

This study investigated cortical thickness in non-demented PD subjects and elucidated its relationship to cognitive impairment using high-resolution T1-weighted brain MRI and comprehensive cognitive function scores from 71 non-demented PD and 48 control subjects matched for age, gender, and education. Cortical thickness was compared between groups using a flexible hierarchical multivariate Bayesian model, which accounts for correlations between brain regions. Correlation analyses were performed among brain areas and cognitive domains as well, which showed significant group differences in the PD population. Compared to Controls, PD subjects demonstrated significant age-adjusted cortical thinning predominantly in inferior and superior parietal areas and extended to superior frontal, superior temporal, and precuneus areas (posterior probability >0.9). Cortical thinning was also found in the left precentral and lateral occipital, and right postcentral, middle frontal, and fusiform regions (posterior probability >0.9). PD patients showed significantly reduced cognitive performance in executive function, including set shifting (p = 0.005) and spontaneous flexibility (p = 0.02), which were associated with the above cortical thinning regions (p < 0.05).","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2015.2465951","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:NS060722,NS082151,NS082143); HMC GCRC(grant numbers:NIH M01RR10732); GCRC Construction(grant numbers:C06RR016499,NSF-DMS-1106962); PSU CTSI(grant numbers:TL1 TR000125,Bigdata RFA UL TR000127); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214255","Parkinson's disease;cognitive impairment;MRI;cortical thickness;hierarchical Bayesian model","Correlation;Bayes methods;PD control;Dementia;Medical diagnostic imaging;Computational biology;Bioinformatics","Aged;Atrophy;Bayes Theorem;Cerebral Cortex;Cognitive Dysfunction;Computational Biology;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease","42","","64","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Methods: We design a novel model based on residual network (ResNet) architecture, named PD-ResNet, to learn the gait differences between PD and HC and between PD with different severity levels. Specifically, a polynomial elevated dimensions technique is applied to increase the dimensions of the input gait features; then, the processed data is transformed into a 3-dimensional picture as the input of PD-ResNet. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), data augmentation, and early stopping technologies are adopted to improve the generalization ability. To further enhance the classification performance, a new loss function, named improved focal loss function, is developed to focus on the train of PD-ResNet on the hard samples and to discard the abnormal samples. Results: The experiments on the clinical gait dataset show that our proposed model achieves excellent performance with an accuracy of 95.51%, a precision of 94.44%, a recall of 96.59%, a specificity of 94.44%, and an F1-score of 95.50%. Moreover, the accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score for the classification of early PD and HC are 92.03%, 94.20%, 90.28%, 93.94%, and 92.20%, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score for the classification of PD with different severity levels are 92.03%, 94.29%, 90.41%, 93.85%, and 92.31%, respectively.

In this study, we investigated how the number and placement of electrodes affects classifying PD patients and healthy controls using machine learning based on EEG sample entropy. We used a custom budget-based search algorithm for selecting optimized sets of channels for classification, and iterated over variable channel budgets to investigate changes in classification performance. Our data consisted of 60-channel EEG collected at three different recording sites, each of which included observations collected both eyes open (total N = 178) and eyes closed (total N = 131). Our results with the data recorded eyes open demonstrated reasonable classification performance (ACC = .76; AUC = .76) with only 5 channels placed far away from each other, the selected regions including right-frontal, left-temporal and midline-occipital sites. Comparison to randomly selected subsets of channels indicated improved classifier performance only with relatively small channel-budgets. The results with the data recorded eyes closed demonstrated consistently worse classification performance (when compared to eyes open data), and classifier performance improved more steadily as a function of number of channels. In summary, our results suggest that a small subset of electrodes of an EEG recording can suffice for detecting PD with a classification performance on par with a full set of electrodes. Furthermore our results demonstrate that separately collected EEG data sets can be used for pooled machine learning based PD detection with reasonable classification performance.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3235040","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:340140,345805,313266,311273,340182,345804 (T.P.),308533 (H.R.)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10011540","Parkinson's disease;electroencephalo-graphy;sample entropy;group-wise feature selection;classification","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Recording;Electrodes;Diseases;Brain modeling;Depression","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Electroencephalography;Algorithms;Electrodes;Support Vector Machine","26","","39","CCBY","9 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A computerized toolkit based on quantitative analysis of handwriting samples would be valuable as it could supplement and support clinical assessments, help monitor micrographia, and link it to PD. Such a toolkit would be especially useful if it could detect subtle yet relevant changes in handwriting morphology, thus enhancing resolution of the detection procedure. This would be made possible by developing a set of metrics sensitive enough to detect and discern micrographia with specificity. Several metrics that are sensitive to the characteristics of micrographia were developed, with minimal sensitivity to confounding handwriting artifacts. These metrics capture character size-reduction, ink utilization, and pixel density within a writing sample from left to right. They are used here to “score” handwritten signatures of 12 different individuals corresponding to healthy and symptomatic PD conditions, and sample control signatures that had been artificially reduced in size for comparison purposes. Moreover, metric analyses of samples from ten of the 12 individuals for which clinical diagnosis time is known show considerable informative variations when applied to static signature samples obtained before and after diagnosis. In particular, a measure called pixel density variation showed statistically significant differences (p <; 0.05) between two comparison groups of remote signature recordings: earlier versus recent, based on independent and paired t-test analyses on a total of 40 signature samples. The quantitative framework developed here has the potential to be used in future controlled experiments to study micrographia and links to PD from various aspects, including monitoring and assessment of applied interventions and treatments. The inherent value in this methodology is further enhanced by its reliance solely on static signatures, not requiring dynamic sampling with specialized equipment.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2518858","U.S. National Science Foundation CBET(grant numbers:1133992); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384677","Diagnosis;handwriting analysis;micrographia;Parkinson's disease;quantitative analysis","Measurement;Writing;Diseases;Clinical diagnosis;Medical treatment;Informatics;Monitoring","Disease Progression;Handwriting;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Monitoring, Physiologic;Parkinson Disease","8","","62","IEEE","18 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the connection between brain structure deficits and physical symptoms in PD, assessing objective brain activity and body motion could provide valuable insights for PD assessment and understanding its underlying mechanisms. This study aimed to explore the connection between brain activity and body movement metrics in a group of individuals with PD and an age-matched healthy control (HC) group. The goal was to evaluate the feasibility of using brain and body motion measures for assessing PD. Participants from both groups underwent the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test under three conditions: simple TUG, cognitive dual-task TUG (CDTUG), and motor dual-task TUG (MDTUG). Key findings include: Both groups exhibited similar activation patterns in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the simple TUG, with motor performance differences observed in cadence. During CDTUG, both groups showed the highest PFC activation with more pronounced motor impairments, such as higher stride and step time. During MDTUG, the HC group exhibited significantly higher PFC activity compared to the PD group. While both groups had similar patterns of activation in PFC area while TUG and CDTUG, they showed distinct behaviour during MDTUG. These results suggest that motor and cognitive impairments in PD are more pronounced during complex activities. While MDTUG effectively differentiated between PD and HC groups, the findings indicate that both cognitive and motor dual-tasks are essential for comprehensive PD assessment.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3546278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10906660","Parkinson’s disease (PD);functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS);motion assessment;gait assessment;brain activity assessment","Motors;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Brain;Diseases;Particle measurements;Motion measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Spatial resolution;Electroencephalography;Neuroimaging","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Male;Female;Aged;Middle Aged;Psychomotor Performance;Brain;Prefrontal Cortex;Cognition;Movement;Task Performance and Analysis","","","38","CCBY","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From neurophysiological perspective, the most prominent feature of Parkinsonian pathophysiology is enhanced beta-band power (1340 Hz beta oscillations) in the local field potentials (LFPs) in motor cortex and in several basal ganglia nuclei. Currently, the most effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease is the electrical deep brain stimulation (eDBS) targeting at the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus, in which electrical current at about 125 Hz is continuously injected in to the target area. Even though eDBS significantly alleviates motor symptoms of the disease, it does not provide a complete cure. Therefore, there have been ongoing efforts to develop more effective brain stimulation paradigms, e.g. exploration of alternative areas for stimulation, or employment of advanced stimulation paradigms. A major obstacle against these efforts has been the ambiguities associated with electrical stimulation. Due to nonspecific nature of electrical stimulation and its incompatibility with simultaneous electrophysiology, it has been challenging to fine tune stimulation parameters and target specific neuronal groups or circuits with eDBS. In this work, we demonstrate optogenetics-based brain stimulation as a potential alternative to electrical brain stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Optogenetics, with its cellular specificity and compatibility with electrophysiology, offers unique opportunities to monitor the neural activity while modulating the activity of targeted neuronal populations. In our study, we address two important premises for assessment of an optogenetics-based therapeutic brain stimulation paradigm: (1) validation of therapeutic value of precisely targeted deep brain optogenetic modulation; (2) demonstration of potential benefits of spatiotemporally patterned optogenetic stimulation of the motor cortex by characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of pathological cortical beta-band activity. In 6-OHDA-induced hemi-Parkinsonian rat model, we used excitatory opsins (ChR2 and C1V1) or inhibitory opsins (iC1C2 and NpHR) to excite or inhibit the subthalamic nucleus. Neural activity across motor cortex was recorded with microelectrode arrays (MEAs, 400μm electrode pitch) implanted unilaterally (6×6 MEA) or bilaterally (two 5×5 MEAs) into the anterior forelimb area of motor cortices. Recording/stimulation sessions were performed during free behavior or during behavioral assays (e.g. amphetamine-induced rotation and mobility test) to quantify and compare therapeutic efficacies of optogenetic stimulation and eDBS. The spatiotemporal dynamics of LFPs were examined with spectral, correlation, and coherence analyses. Our data confirmed the motor deficits such as akinesia and rotational bias in h-P rats. eDBS of subthalamic nucleus improved these motor deficits to some extent, but not completely. In agreement with earlier findings (Gradinaru et al., Science, 2009), optogenetic excitation of subthalamic nucleus did not lead to behavioral improvements; by contrast we found that optogenetic inhibition of subthalamic did alleviate akinesia and rotational bias. Accompanying the motor deficits, elevated betaband power in LFPs was observed on the lesioned side of motor cortex. Interestingly, these beta oscillations appeared intermittently only at certain locations as distinct spatial activity patterns. A linear discriminant analysis showed that the beta band power at some recording sites was indistinguishable from control levels. However, further analysis indicated that these sites could be distinguished from control sites by their phase coherence. We found, within the lesioned motor cortex, excess phase coherence at the beta band between pairs of recording sites. The beta synchrony was not distributed uniformly; it was more pronounced between sites with higher beta power. Single-site optogenetic modulation of subthalamic nucleus led to behavioral improvements, but effects were limited as in eDBS. Our results show that optogenetics-based brain stimulation could be used as a therapeutic interference in Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, the variation of beta power and phase across motor cortex implied inhomogeneity in the extent of Parkinsonism, and hence, the potential therapeutic benefit of differential neuromodulation at different cortical sites. Therefore, given the anatomical and functional location of the motor cortex within motor circuitry and its large size, our results imply that spatiotemporally-specific optogenetic modulation of motor cortex might be a potential approach for therapeutic brain stimulation. Such modulation paradigm could allow more specific control of motor cortical activity, and thereby alleviate motor symptoms. Our next step is to investigate the therapeutic potential of spatiotemporally-specific optogenetic modulation of the motor cortex, for which we will use custom optoelectrode arrays with capabilities of multi-site light delivery and electrophysiology.","2189-8723","978-1-5090-6664-3","10.1109/ICIIBMS.2017.8279731","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8279731","optogenetics;hemiparkinsonian rat;deep brain stimulation;neuromodulation;motor cortex","Brain stimulation;Parkinson's disease;Modulation;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Electric potential;Neuromodulation;Electrical stimulation","","1","","","IEEE","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging is an alternative scale which is easier to administer and provides a succinct descriptor of overall PD severity. There is no universal agreement amongst neurologists on the specific PD symptoms they need to be assessing in order to prescribe treatments and optimize symptom management for their patients, and practically there are no clinical scales which are recorded in daily clinical practice. In this study, we systematically evaluate diverse symptoms (as expressed in 44 UPDRS items) and aim to provide a statistical association with UPDRS and H&Y using rank correlation and mutual information metrics. Moreover, we investigate the projection of a UPDRS item subset on a 2D plot to map onto H&Y. We report some statistically strong correlations of PD symptoms against UPDRS and H&Y (|R| ≥ 0.3), and provide an intuitively appealing visualization mapping onto H&Y.

This method has been successfully applied to the analysis of epileptic discharges in laboratory animals, as well as human electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals. One of the first applications of the method was the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. Throughout the development of the method, two fundamentally different approaches to the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor have been explored. The first approach is based on the analysis of local maxima on wavelet spectrograms of accelerometer signals and the envelopes of electromyographic signals. The second approach is based on the analysis of local maxima on cross-wavelet spectrograms of the envelopes of electromyographic signals from antagonist muscle pairs. Both methods have been patented. This paper compares two aforementioned methods for differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, based on two years of clinical experience in applying these methods at the Research Center of Neurology.

This study aimed to objectively quantify rigidity through the use of surface electromyography (sEMG) during interaction with a bee-themed serious game, so-called RehaBEElitation, which is controlled by a wearable device specifically designed for this purpose. Data were collected from five healthy participants and five individuals with PD, matched in age and sex, in both “on” and “off” medication states. The participants' muscle activity was collected while performing active movements and while interacting with the Phase 4 of the game. Several steps were applied to process the sEMG signals: Butterworth filters, Notch filter, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) normalisation, rectification, signal enveloping, and Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis. The highest value of PSD was computed and correlated with the MDS-UPDRS scores. Statistical analyses revealed that the PD “off” group exhibited the lowest power amplitude at PSD-measured frequencies, followed by the PD “on” group, and then, by the healthy group. Significant correlations were observed between MDS-UPDRS scores and sEMG data across most axes. These results indicate that individuals with Parkinson's disease experience greater impairments in muscle activity and coordination compared to healthy individuals, reflecting increased rigidity.","2158-4001","979-8-3315-2116-5","10.1109/ICCE63647.2025.10930174","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development(grant numbers:442150/2023-7,405365/2023-3,174190/2023-9); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel(grant numbers:CAPES/COFECUB-88881.370894/2019-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10930174","Parkinson's disease;rigidity;objective evaluation;electromyography","Performance evaluation;Parkinson's disease;Statistical analysis;Muscles;Electromyography;Rigidity;Serious games;Reliability;Wearable devices;Notch filters","","","","28","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The conventional methods, since they depend on clinical assessment and rely on subjective human opinion, carry a danger of delayed diagnosis. This article introduces a machine learning-based approach for early Parkinson's disease detection using digital drawing tasks. By analyzing fine motor skills through drawing exercises performed on a touchscreen device, the system extracts key features such as stroke length, pressure fluctuations, velocity, and motion fluidity. Machine learning classifiers–Random Forest and SC Boost–are trained on this feature set to differentiate between healthy individuals and PD patients. Preliminary results indicate high predictive accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of digital drawing analysis as a non-invasive, cost-effective screening tool for early PD detection. Preliminary results indicate that both classes are highly predictive, whereas SC Boost outperforms random forest. A promising technique for the early detection of PD, the SC Boost algorithm reached an accuracy of 87%. This study indicates that digital drawing analysis could be a feasible, low-cost, and non-invasive means of testing for Parkinson's disease. In the end, those at risk of PD may have a better quality of life if machine learning is used in clinical settings to help with earlier diagnosis and faster treatment. Further research would be required to determine whether these results hold with larger samples and to identify other drawing tasks needed to improve categorization accuracy.","","979-8-3315-2476-0","10.1109/ETCC65847.2025.11108591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11108591","Parkinson's Disease;CNN;Drawing;Boost classifiers;Stochastic Gradient Boosting;Random Forest","Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Stochastic processes;Touch sensitive screens;Feature extraction;Motors;Prediction algorithms;Robustness;Random forests;Testing","","","","30","IEEE","12 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Symptoms are managed rather than the illness's course being halted or slowed down. One promising avenue for developing new treatments for PD is through the identification of biomarkers that can track disease progression and predict treatment outcomes. In recent years, researchers have made significant strides in identifying potential biomarkers for PD, includes protein and abnormalities in peptides that are associated with the onset and worsening of the disease. However, the complexity of the clinical and neurobiological data on Parkinson’s disease has made it challenging to identify clear biomarkers or develop effective treatments.The AMPPD is a rich resource of clinical and molecular data collected from over 10,000 subjects with Parkinson’s disease on which models are trained to measure progression in patients with PD.

Sensory cues have been known to improve walking performance and reduce freezing of gait. Visual cues are reported to be particularly effective for this purpose. So far, sensory cues have generally been provided continuously, even when currently not needed. However, a recent approach suggests the provision of cues just in the case that freezing actually occurs. The arguments in favor of this “on-demand” cueing are reduced intrusiveness and reduced habituation to cues. Here, we analyzed the effect of visual cues on the number and duration of freezing episodes when activated either just “on-demand” or continuously and compare it to the baseline condition where no cue is provided. For this purpose, 7 Parkinson's patients regularly suffering from freezing of gait repeatedly walked a pre-defined course and their reaction to parallel laser lines projected in front of them on the floor was analyzed. The results show that, in comparison to the baseline condition, the mean duration of freezing was reduced by 51% in continuous cueing and by 69% in “on-demand” cueing. Concerning the number of freezing episodes, 43% fewer episodes were observed for continuous cueing and 9% less episodes for “on-demand” cueing.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6347005","","Visualization;Legged locomotion;Floors;Lasers;Parkinson's disease;Performance evaluation","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Cues;Female;Freezing Reaction, Cataleptic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Male;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Psychomotor Performance;Treatment Outcome;Visual Perception","18","","22","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During a TF, the feet of PD patients appear to become stuck whilst making a turn. This paper presents an electroencephalography (EEG) based classification method for detecting turning freezing episodes in six PD patients during Timed Up and Go Task experiments. Since EEG signals have a time-variant nature, time-frequency Stockwell Transform (S-Transform) techniques were used for feature extraction. The EEG sources were separated by means of independent component analysis using entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM). The distinctive frequency-based features of selected independent components of EEG were extracted and classified using Bayesian Neural Networks. The classification demonstrated a high sensitivity of 84.2%, a specificity of 88.0% and an accuracy of 86.2% for detecting TF.

Different motion tracking systems such as inertial measurement units (IMU) are widely used to detect gait parameters associated with the severity of Parkinson's disease. Although these systems are accurate enough to measure different gait parameters, they utilize a predefined model of human gait to measure these parameters. Model- based signal processing, that takes into account the kinematics of human body, enforces that sensors be placed in a certain configuration in terms of orientation and location which introduces a burden at the signal processing development phase. In addition, it affects the accuracy and robustness of the system when the user does not place the sensors at their pre-defined locations and with a pre-define orientation. In this paper, we introduce a set of model-free features to estimate gait parameters for the applications of diagnosing and quantifying the severity of Parkinson's disease. A model-free signal processing technique does not limit sensor placement, in addition, it does not require the knowledge on the kinematics of the users and the human subjects. We show that our proposed features, using a model-free signal processing technique, are highly correlated (R-value up to 0.96 for suitable locations) with gait parameters obtained from model-based sophisticated algorithms. Therefore, these simple model-free features may be suitable for ongoing assessment of Parkinson's disease and they can be an alternative for conventional gait parameters used for rapid application development.","","978-1-5090-2991-4","10.1109/ICCCN.2017.8038414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038414","","Feature extraction;Acceleration;Signal processing;Sensor systems;Correlation;Parkinson's disease","","1","","11","IEEE","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In handwriting assessment, Archimedes spiral drawing is one of the most proposed tasks, due to its peculiar shape and ease of execution. In the last decades, digitizing tablets had been widely employed for the evaluation of the spiral performance, providing a cheap and non-invasive way to gather quantitative information, to be combined with the classical clinical examination. Despite this advantage, such approach cannot easily be adopted in an unsupervised scenario and lacks the natural feel of the traditional pen-and-paper approach. This work aims at overcoming these limitations by employing a smart ink pen, designed to write on paper and instrumented with inertial and force sensors, to automatically collect data related to spiral drawing execution of PD patients (n=30) and age-matched healthy controls (n=30). From the raw data, several time and frequency domains features were extracted and compared between the groups. The statistical analysis revealed some significant differences, showing less smooth acceleration and force profiles for PD patients. However, given the heterogeneous symptoms presented by the PD cohort, a detailed analysis of exemplifying PD patients was conducted, showing the ability of Archimedes spiral drawing to capture and quantify PD characteristic features.Clinical Relevance— Among the first clinical manifestations of the pathology, handwriting impairment appears in PD patients. It is often underestimated and not investigated properly.

Seven PD patients performed a gait task up to 15 times while wearing sensors on their upper and lower limbs. Each task was performed at specific points during a test day, following a single dose of levodopa-carbidopa. At the time of the tasks the patients were video recorded and three movement disorder experts rated their motor function on three clinical scales: a treatment response scale (TRS) that ranged from -3 (very bradykinetic) to 0 (ON) to +3 (very dyskinetic), a dyskinesia score that ranged from 0 (no dyskinesia) to 4 (extreme dyskinesia), and a bradykinesia score that ranged from 0 (no bradykinesia) to 4 (extreme bradykinesia). Raw accelerometer and gyroscope data of the sensors were processed and analyzed with time series analysis methods to extract features. The utilized features quantified separate limb movements as well as movement symmetries between the limbs. The features were processed with principal component analysis and the components were used as predictors for separate support vector machine (SVM) models for each of the three scales. The performance of each model was evaluated in a leave-one-patient out setting where the observations of a single patient were used as the testing set and the observations of the other 6 patients as the training set. Root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficients for the predictions showed a good ability of the models to map the sensor data into the rating scales. There were strong correlations between the SVM models and the mean ratings of TRS (0.79; RMSE=0.70), bradykinesia score (0.79; RMSE=0.47), and bradykinesia score (0.78; RMSE=0.46).

The driving input contains receptive field properties that must be transmitted while the modulating input alters the specifics of transmission. Relay reliability of a relay cell is defined as the fraction of pulses in the driving input that generate action potentials at the neuron's output, and is in general a complicated function of the driving input, the modulating input and the cell's properties. In a recent study, we computed analytic bounds on the reliability of relay neurons for a class of Poisson driving inputs and sinusoidal modulating inputs. Here, we generalize our analysis and compute bounds on the relay reliability for any modulating input. Furthermore, we show that if the modulating input is generated by a colored Gaussian process, closed form expressions for bounds on relay reliability can be derived. We applied our analysis to investigate relay reliability of thalamic cells in health and in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is hypothesized that in health, neurons in the motor thalamus relay information only when needed and this capability is compromised in PD due to exaggerated beta-band oscillations in the modulating input from the basal ganglia (BG). To test this hypothesis, we used modulating and driving inputs simulated from a detailed computational model of the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical motor loop and computed our theoretical bounds in both PD and healthy conditions. Our bounds match well with our empirically computed reliability and show that the relay reliability is larger in the healthy condition across the population of thalamic neurons. Furthermore, we show that the increase in power in the beta-band of the modulating input (output of BG) is causally related with the decrease in relay reliability in the PD condition.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945134","","Relays;Neurons;Reliability theory;Computational modeling;Sociology;Statistics","Action Potentials;Animals;Basal Ganglia;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Motor Cortex;Neurons;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Thalamus","1","","14","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We revealed two subtypes of de novo PD patients by using longitudinal data from the PPMI dataset. Compared to the conventional clinical TD/PIGD phenotypes, our subtyping was highly stable in 5 years’ visits. The two subtypes of PD showed significant differences in motor symptoms, medication effects, CSF biomarkers, and longitudinal progression. Moreover, patients of subtype 2 showed widespread lower cortical-to-dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) connections and higher medication effects on motor symptoms which was regulated by 5-HT neurons in DRN. Our results suggest distinct neuropathological pathways underlying the two subtypes, such that, in contrast to the typical PD subtype, patients of subtype 2 may be affected by serotonergic modulation on dopaminergic neurons in striatum. Our study opens new avenue to precision medicine and personalized treatments in PD and may be applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-2447-1","10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340372","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10340372","","Pathology;Precision medicine;Neurons;Modulation;Biomarkers;Biology;Reliability","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Biomarkers;Phenotype;Dopaminergic Neurons","","","14","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since PD is irreversible and its treatment only slows down its rate of development, the early diagnosis by accurate prediction is of great significance to retard its deterioration. However, the existing computer-assisted diagnosis methods for PD have limitations in exploring the implicit and spatial information in the brain. In view of this limitation, a 3D network based on self-supervised learning strategy and attention mechanism is proposed for PD classification in this paper. The proposed method put the input of successive frames from the preprocessed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data into 3D ResNet18 with the classifier module for PD classification. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to explore the discriminative features. Meanwhile, a self-supervised learning pretext task and a regression task are designed to assist in training and improve the robustness of the proposed model.

This study aims to develop a deep residual network (ResNet) that incorporates a Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM) to enhance the accuracy(ACC) of early Parkinson's disease diagnosis and classification. We utilized the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) image dataset from the Progress Marker Initiative (PPMI) database, which comprises data from 322 healthy individuals and 287 PD patients. The DICOM images were initially preprocessed, converted to NIfTI format, and aligned to MNI standard space using the FLIRT tool and the DARTEL algorithm. The SPM toolbox in MATLAB facilitated the removal of non-brain tissue and the uniform resizing of images to meet the model's input specifications. Representative median slices were then selected for model input. Our model introduces a spatial attention layer to the traditional ResNet architecture that combines maximum and average pooling to produce a spatial weight map, enhancing key features while suppressing irrelevant information. Experimental results revealed that the ResNet with spatial attention significantly outperformed the baseline model in PD classification, achieving a 96.581% ACC — an 8.547% improvement—and raising the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value varied from 0.94 to 0.97. The model's overall recognition capability has increased with almost unchanged precision, recall, and F1 score.

Diagnosis of PD today largely clinical and relies on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS, also referred to as UPDRS), wherein clinicians observe gait patterns in patients and provide a subjective score ranging from 0-4 based on the ability of the patient to ambulate with out without aid. Diagnosis of PD is also complicated by 1) a lack of distinguishability from other gait and neurodegenerative disorders, including essential tremor (ET) and 2) increasing ambiguity of PD symptoms including gait deterioration and falls further from the onset of the condition. However, early PD diagnosis is imperative for patients to respond appropriately to intervention and relieve motor symptoms such as tremor and rigidity. This study aims to develop a gait-based diagnostic framework for PD using data collected at the University of Minnesota from healthy controls and PD patients over 3 years.

The final metrics, including accuracy, standard error, and p-values, displayed the value in applying gait variables, such as cadence, in diagnostic models of PD.

Detecting it early is very important because it helps doctors provide better treatment and support before symptoms become severe. However, early signs are often small and easy to miss. In this work, we introduce a method called PD-Net that helps in recognizing these early signs by observing how a person walks, talks, and moves over time. The system looks for patterns or changes in these activities that are commonly linked to Parkinson’s. It carefully watches for movements that stand out or repeat in a specific way and uses that information to suggest whether a person might be at risk. The method was tested using real examples and compared with other existing tools. PD-Net gave more accurate and reliable results, correctly identifying warning signs more often. It also helps explain which actions were important in making that decision, making it easier for doctors to understand and trust the system. This approach has the potential to be used in real healthcare settings and may support doctors in providing earlier and more accurate diagnoses.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely used in the diagnosis and monitoring of various neurological diseases. When correctly interpreted, the diagnostic accuracy is very high. When EEG diagnoses Parkinson’s disease (PD), it is challenging to find accurate biomarkers, which is why EEG diagnosis of PD has not yet become popular. By studying the EEG data, it was found that there are characteristics in the power spectral density (PSD) image calculated using the Pwelch method to analyze and calculate the EEG. According to the characteristics of the image, it can be divided into four categories with different colors: first, it is found that the trend of the red and blue image curves is basically the same, and the energy of blue on the Delta (0.1-4Hz) wave is higher than that of red; the trend of the pink and green image curves is basically the same, and the energy of pink on the Delta (0.1-4Hz) wave is higher than that of green. Secondly, the energy of the red PSD image is very low in the full frequency band, while the energy of the full frequency band in the green, blue and pink PSD images is much higher than that in the red PSD images. It can be inferred that the brain activity of PD patients in the frontal lobe is slower. Finally, it was observed that there were eight symmetrical pairs of EEG sampling points, of which four symmetrical pairs showed obvious fitting inconsistencies, which showed that the PSD of PD patients had asymmetric characteristics. In addition, it was observed that the brain areas with active brain activity, that is, high PSD energy, had very obvious asymmetric characteristics, while the brain areas with lower energy were basically symmetrical.","","979-8-3315-1658-1","10.1109/ICHIH63459.2024.11064781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11064781","parkinson’s disease;EEG;power spectral density","Neurological diseases;Brain;Accuracy;Frontal lobe;Fitting;Biomarkers;Market research;Electroencephalography;Time-domain analysis;Monitoring","","","","31","IEEE","9 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The loss of dopamine-producing neurons causes Parkinson's disease, a degenerative disorder. When the condition first manifests, patients have tremors, bradykinesia, poor posture, and balance among other mobility impairments that progressively get worse over time. Additionally, as the global ageing population grows exponentially, more people are developing Parkinson's disease, which places a significant financial strain on governments. Structural modifications in the brain of individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease, resulting from a deficiency in dopamine, can be visualized through the application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this particular investigation, an attempt was made to classify MR images of both Parkinson's disease patients and unaffected individuals by utilizing a sophisticated deep learning neural network. The utilization of a convolutional neural network proves to be instrumental in augmenting the diagnostic capabilities concerning Parkinson's disease. The MR images are meticulously scrutinized and subjected to rigorous evaluation in order to derive accurate metrics pertaining to their classification. The primary objective of this investigation aims to establish an approach for accurately discerning and classifying ailments through the utilization of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Deep learning exhibits remarkable proficiency in disease diagnosis and image interpretation. A burgeoning body of scholarly inquiry suggests that the identification and prognostication of Parkinson's disease may necessitate the application of deep learning methodologies. In terms of disease prediction, deep learning models wield immense potency. The best early detection accuracy deep learning algorithms are hence the subject of increased research. In this experiment, the illness stage will be determined by brain imaging. Also, to the study suggests an effective deep learning approach for early disease prediction utilizing MRI data.

Finally, the feature vectors were discriminated between subjects by using the principal components. The discrimination power of the presented approach was tested with EMG and acceleration data measured from 46 patients with PD (on-medication) and 59 healthy controls.

This task is especially challenging in the brain as the underlying dynamics are not well-understood. This paper aims to introduce a novel causality measure called frequency-domain convergent cross-mapping (FDCCM) that utilizes frequency-domain dynamics through nonlinear state-space reconstruction. Method: Using synthesized chaotic timeseries, we investigate general applicability of FDCCM at different causal strengths and noise levels. We also apply our method on two resting-state Parkinson's datasets with 31 and 54 subjects, respectively. To this end, we construct causal networks, extract network features, and perform machine learning analysis to distinguish Parkinson's disease patients (PD) from age and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Specifically, we use the FDCCM networks to compute the betweenness centrality of the network nodes, which act as features for the classification models. Result: The analysis on simulated data showed that FDCCM is resilient to additive Gaussian noise, making it suitable for real-world applications. Our proposed method also decodes scalp-EEG signals to classify the PD and HC groups with approximately 97% leave-one-subject-out cross-validation accuracy. We compared decoders from six cortical regions to find that features derived from the left temporal lobe lead to a higher classification accuracy of 84.5% compared to other regions. Moreover, when the classifier trained using FDCCM networks from one dataset was tested on an independent out-of-sample dataset, it attained an accuracy of 84%. This accuracy is significantly higher than correlational networks (45.2%) and CCM networks (54.84%). Significance: These findings suggest that our spectral-based causality measure can improve classification performance and reveal useful network biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2023.3250355","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1954749); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10056286","Brain networks;convergent cross-mapping;frequency-domain convergent cross-mapping;classification;effective connectivity;electroencephalography;functional connectivity;machine learning;Parkinson's disease","Electroencephalography;Logistics;Frequency-domain analysis;Brain modeling;Recording;Mathematical models;Sociology","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Brain;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography","21","","65","IEEE","28 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eight PD patients were recruited and performed straight-walking and turning tasks under constrained and unconstrained scenarios 4 hours before and after the medication at hourly intervals. The results demonstrated that the GNI could efficiently reflect the motor fluctuation after the medication (p<0.05) and PD patients perform their actual gait ability during the unconstrained straight walking scenarios.

Two types of UPDRS tests that can be supported by VTP are presented in the paper. In the Finger Taps test the patient taps thumb with the index finger in rapid succession. The Rapid Alternating Movement of Hands test consists in pronation-supination movements of hands.

Using this framework, city residents will have their health constantly monitored and get feedback on their PD situation. Early PD symptoms can, therefore, be detected and the proper medication provided. In this framework, we use speech signals from clients captured from various sensors and transmitted to the cloud for processing.

We propose to tackle the problem as a semi-supervised anomaly detection task, where we model the physiological patterns of healthy subjects instead.

Various methods have been introduced in order to detect PD in its early stages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an effective and efficient method since it is an inexpensive and non-invasive tool which produces high-resolution images. In this paper, early diagnosis of PD has been carried out using different CNN models. Image enhancement has been performed on the magnetic resonance (MR) images in the dataset. After extracting the region of interest (ROI), in this case the substantia nigra (SN) region, a custom CNN model and VGG-16 are implemented for automatically differentiating SN in image and no SN in the image. We then performed binary classification to accurately discriminate between PD and control subjects by implementing deep learning models ResNet-34, VGG-19, ResNet-50 and improved AlexNet.

Our goal is to study the complexity and predictability of gait of PD subjects in comparison to the gait of normal subjects. At the same time we used the features extracted for this purpose to classify PD subjects with DBS off or on from healthy control subjects. The angular velocity signals obtained from four uni-axial gyroscopes were used for feature extraction. These four gyroscopes were attached to the right and left shanks and thighs. Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Hurst Exponent (HE) and Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD) are the three nonlinear features used for classification. 9 PD subjects and 10 healthy controls were participated in the experiments. The results showed that ApEn and HFD have greater values for PD subjects (with DBS off) indicating more complexity and irregularity in their walking dynamics. Also HE had smaller values for PD subjects (with DBS off) indicating less predictability in their gait time series. The k-nearest neighbor classifier with leave-one-out cross validation method were used for classification and we succeeded to discriminate PD subjects (with DBS off) from the normal ones with the high accuracy of 100%. The accuracy for discrimination of PD subjects with DBS on from the normal ones was 89.47%. Then we analyzed the signals of each single gyroscope, one by one, to find the most informative signal. We achieved the high classification accuracy of 100% (for PD subjects with DBS off) using only the signals of the right shank or the right thigh.

Most biomechanical data characterizing human movement is shown as time series or temporal waveforms representing different joint measures. Principal component analysis (PCA) can be used as a tool to identify differences in gait between healthy persons and those diagnosed with PD. The purpose of this study is to compare hip and knee kinematics during walking in PD group and control (CO) group using PCA, and to identify the specific PCA variables that can be used for differentiating Parkinsonian gait from normal gait. The subjects were divided into two groups: PD group n = 15, control group n = 12. Each subject performed a gait task and kinematics of limbs was measured using nine degrees of freedom inertial measurement unit (IMU). PCA was performed on the angular velocity of right and left side hip and knee joints in the sagittal plane of the gait cycle. Different numbers of principal components (PC) are needed to describe important information from hip (PC - 3) and knee (PC - 4) joints in sagittal plane. Statistically significant differences were found between PD and CO groups: right hip PC3 (p=0.0026); left hip PC3 (p=0.0262); right knee PC3 (p=0.0286). The PCA applied in this paper identified differences in gait features between PD and CO groups.

In the cognitive world, it stimulates thinking capabilities. It prompts a reaction to a particular situation and allows body parts to move. In addition, it also regulates other physiological functions such as digestion and respiration. The nervous system consists of billions of cells which interpret information from sensory elements and translate it into coordinated action performed by various parts of the body. With the increase in age, the steady decline of these cells results in a loss of dopamine compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an unforeseen expansion of the movement of bodily extremities that results in this decline. Finding a cure for this disease is still an enormous challenge, and its progression can be slowed by early detection. The proposed work has been implemented with seven machine learning and deep-learning techniques, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbour, neural network model, and support vector machines for preemptively predicting PD. The model was implemented utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. This included the normal cases as well as those with PD. The findings showed that the random forest model was superior to others, achieving an accuracy of 86.70%. In contrast, the naive Bayes model displayed the lowest accuracy of 71.50%. In addition, both the random forest and support vector machine models showed the highest accuracy levels of 85.90%. Various other performance metrics such as computational time, AUC (the Area Under the Curve), F1-score, ROC curve area, and recall rate were utilized to predict the effectiveness of each technique. Comparative analysis identified that the least performing models are the k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayes methods. In the future, this method can be refined further by using a large dataset and employing deep learning models for higher predictive outcomes.","","979-8-3503-0644-6","10.1109/ICCICA60014.2024.10585049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10585049","Parkinson’s disease;k-nearest neighbour;machine learning;deep learning;neural networks;random forest;decision tree","Support vector machines;Deep learning;Radio frequency;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Brain modeling","","1","","20","IEEE","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the overlap of these symptoms with other neurological conditions and the lack of conclusive diagnostic tests, PD diagnosis is often prolonged (up to years) and may be inaccurate. This research explores the use of Random Forest, a machine learning (ML) algorithm, to enhance the speed and accuracy of PD diagnosis. Our model has been trained on a medical dataset consisting of patient demographics and biomarker data, as they are considered some of the earliest indicators of the disease. The Random Forest model allows for powerful pattern recognition by integrating multiple decision trees, offering reliable diagnostic support for current clinical practices.

Microbubbles (MBs) have been exploited as a carrier for GDNF delivery with focused ultrasound (FUS) destruction. However, GDNF supplementation only relieves PD symptoms rather than cure it. Thus, design of an endogenous GDNF generative mechanism is an urgent concern for novel PD treatment. Here, we synthesized a cationic MBs (cMBs) with high GDNF plasmid (GDNFp) binding to achieve blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) with FUS, and currently enhance the GDNFp transfection for PD therapy. PD lesions were established by implanting 6-hydroxydopamine into left brain of rats. A 1-MHz FUS (0.7 MPa, duty factor = 5 %, PRF = 1 Hz, sonication time = 90 s) was sonicated at striatum and substantia nigra after GcMBs injection. Sites of gene expression were confirmed by firefly luciferase gene-loaded cMBs (LcMBs) with bioluminescence imaging, individually. The motor behavior and dopamine (DA) levels of the treated rats were traced to estimate treatment outcome. Result showed that the positively charge of cMBs (+39.48 ± 9.28 mV) made them significant for DNA binding. With FUS, GcMBs provided sufficient BBBD area for enhanced gene transfection in PD lesion. Bioluminescence data showed that the released Luc-gene expressed started from 24 h after treatment. The GDNF level of PD rats restored following the combing treatment (66.6 % of recovery). The treatment reduced rotations by 92.2 ± 5.7%, and improved of DA levels by 164.9 ± 1.23%. This study confirmed that GcMBs with FUS provides a novel strategy for local gene therapy in PD rats.","","978-1-4799-8182-3","10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7329528","cationic microbubble;focused ultrasound;Parkinson's disease;gene therapy;blood-brain barrier","Ultrasonic imaging;Artificial intelligence;IP networks;Immune system;Neurons;Chlorine;Polymers","","","","10","IEEE","16 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The condition may result in tremors, stiffness, or sluggishness of movement. Although there is no known treatment for this illness, the symptoms can be markedly reduced with medicines. To increase accuracy, this paper aims to forecast Parkinson's disease using machine learning methods like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These algorithms perform better when used as classifiers, leading to higher accuracy. Hence using these algorithms, the machine learning model can easily predict Parkinson's disease. The accuracy of extreme gradient boosting was 92% and that of the support vector machine was 87%. XGBoost has a built-in capability to handle missing values and it provides various features. It is also effective with large datasets. Support Vector Machines outperform other classification algorithms in terms of performance and speed. It determines the best hyperplane for accurately classifying data points between several classes. The major goal of this study is to more accurately and effectively forecast Parkinson's disease so that it can be treated at the right time to minimize subsequent dangers. More Parkinson's disease cures and higher survival times result from early diagnosis. After detecting the disease, it can be cured through physical treatments and sometimes through surgery or in some cases through medications. It is observed that people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease are of an average age of 60, men are most likely to have this disease and it advances with the age of a person. The progress of Parkinson's disease is usually slow.

Physical structures exhibit minimal damage at early diagnosis, complicating the prediction of Parkinson's illness in its initial stages based solely on physical observation. Recent studies on electroencephalogram (EEG) signs in the identification of Parkinson's illness have revealed significant aspects pertinent to early detection. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a multifaceted signal comprising several non-linear and non-stationary elements. Subsequently, an auto-encoder-based deep extraction of features method is employed to derive the spatial and temporal attributes from the four frequency partitions. Additionally, statistical and spectral attributes are obtained. The gathered attributes are utilized to analyze notable patterns associated with Parkinson's disease. Optimal weighted feature fusion is achieved through the precise adjustment of weights. The proposed DLB-LSTM (Densely Located Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory) employs weighted features so that we can identify PD.

The rotarod test and pole test were performed to evaluate the behavioral changes after ultrasound treatment. Then, the activity of microglia and astrocyte were measured to evaluate the inflammation level in the brain. Results: Ultrasound stimulation improved the latency to falls in the rotarod test (p = 0.033) and decreased the climbing time in the pole test (p = 0.016) compared with MPTP+sham group. Moreover, ultrasound stimulation reduced the chronic inflammation response as shown in microglia (p = 0.007) and astrocyte (p = 0.032) activation. In addition, HE, Nissl and Tunel staining showed that no brain tissue injury was induced by US. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated that ultrasound stimulation could suppress neuroinflammation in PD mice. Significance: Transcranial ultrasound neuromodulation offers a novel approach for Parkinson's disease intervention, potentially through its anti-neuroinflammation functions.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2021.3071807","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11904380,12004408); Key technologies for treatment of brain disorders(grant numbers:2018B030332001,2018B030331001); Shenzhen Basic Science Research(grant numbers:JCYJ20200109105622824,JCYJ20180302145852654,JCYJ20200109110006136); Key Laboratory for Magnetic Resonance and Multimodality Imaging of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B1212060051); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M682993); Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology Innovation Program for Excellent Young Researchers; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399290","Transcranial ultrasound;Deep brain stimulation;Parkinson's disease;Neuromodulation;Neuroinflammation","Ultrasonic imaging;Mice;Transducers;Diseases;Immune system;Brain;Biological system modeling","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine;Animals;Disease Models, Animal;Dopaminergic Neurons;Mice;Mice, Inbred C57BL;Parkinson Disease","43","","66","IEEE","8 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the development of wearable devices, mobile health detection has become a hot spot. Different from traditional computer-aided diagnosis, this paper is devoted to modeling Parkinson’s disease staging in the field of mobile health using smart watch. First, we analyze the factors that hinder the Parkinson’s disease staging model in the field of mobile health from the three aspects of environment, wearables and wearing. Second, in a free-living environment, the problem of uncertainty in activities of daily living has a fatal impact on machine learning models. On the one hand, the uncertainty of activities caused by patients’ independent completion of activity collection; on the other hand, the uncertainty of staging labels caused by the use of remote video diagnosis by clinicians. Finally, considering many of the above factors, we used smart watch to collect patients’ daily activity data, and built a machine learning model to stage the condition of Parkinson’s patients in free-living environment. Following that, experiments were conducted using our collected dataset of 70 Parkinson’s disease patients to quantify and remove uncertainty in daily activity data in free-living environment. The experimental results show that for Parkinson’s disease staging in free-living environment, the uncertainty of the data is the main factor leading to the instability and low performance of the model. Meanwhile, the anomaly detection and uncertain label detection can alleviate the impact of the uncertainty of the data on the model. In addition, it is verified that the staging framework for Parkinson’s patients in free-living environment constructed using smart watch is feasible.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-8622-6","10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822004","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10822004","mobile health;free-living environment;parkinson’s disease;daily activity;activities of daily living","Hands;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Data models;Computer aided diagnosis;Wearable devices;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Diseases","","","","26","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, not much research has been initiated in the areas of alzheimer disease or neurological information systems. The second significant neurological disease that causes people to face severe consequences is Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disease that affects millions of people around the world. Most of the cases are undetected because of a lack of detection techniques. This research adopts a data mining technique to study about the literature on the detection, early stage, and treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The study was conducted by browsing for the literature indexed by Scopus, and the literature includes terms about data-mining and condition of Parkinson’s disease. This research study will focus on how DMT and its applications have been evolving in the case of PD over the last 16 years. In this line, this research categorizes the literature survey and takes up the methods of data mining, their applications, and how they have developed over the years 2004 to 2020. The DMT review will be picked up through the Scopus online database, which yielded 273 papers in 159 scholarly journals about the uses of DMT through the use of word indices and articles abstracts. Another objective that this work seeks is to provide guidance to researchers on the use of data analysis associated with the study of Parkinson’s disease. Data mining recently has emerged as an effective tool in the area of research regarding Parkinson’s disease (PD) offering substantial potential to enhance our knowledge of this complex neurodegenerative disease.","","979-8-3503-6810-9","10.1109/ICICAT62666.2024.10923302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10923302","Data Mining;Parkinson’s Disease;Machine Learning;Diagnosis;Prognosis;Treatment;Neurodegenerative Disorder;Healthcare;Systematic Review","Neurological diseases;Surveys;Costs;Medical services;Data mining;Prognostics and health management;Speech processing;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Systematic literature review","","","","34","IEEE","20 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experimental results showed that analysis of in-air trajectories is capable of assessing subtle motor abnormalities that are connected with PD. Moreover, conjunction of in-air trajectories with conventional on-surface handwriting allows us to build predictive model with PD classification accuracy over 80%. In total, we compute over 600 handwriting features.

Before the appearance of symptoms, the biochemical and pathological changes start in the brain, which are not often easily appreciable in routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Several studies have performed statistical analysis on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps extracted from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data to identify the differences between PD and healthy control (HC) groups. Their results demonstrated a significant reduction in fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) in many brain regions of the PD group compared to the healthy control. Though some studies have shown Parkinson's segregation from healthy subjects based on a statistical analysis of FA and MD maps extracted from DTI data, the current diagnostic procedures are expertise-demanding and thus necessitate a classification of PD based on artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we aim to investigate different deep learning solutions (using a 3D ResNet-18 neural network) trained with different frameworks. To this end, six different training scenarios were investigated through feeding the network with different input data extracted from the DTI to determine the best performing framework for early PD detection. The six model training frameworks include (1) single-input for only DTI imag es, (2) single-input for only FA maps, (3) single-input for only MD maps, (4) double-input for FA and MD maps, (5) double-input for DTI images and FA maps (6), and double-input for DTI images and MD maps. The network trained by FA and MD maps exhibited poor diagnostic accuracy of 40% and 50%, respectively. However, the best accuracy (67%) and area under the receiver (AUC) (69%) were achieved by the model trained with only DTI as input. Results demonstrated that the models trained with FA and MD maps are not appropriate for early PD detection. Moreover, the results showed that even if these maps are used as an additional image next to the DTI data, they could not improve the results of the model compared to the model trained with only DTI map. The best accuracy and AUC were achieved by the model trained only with DTI map. Though the accuracy obtained from the different models is relatively low, the focus of this study was to determine the best-performing model/scenario for early PD detection.","2577-0829","978-1-6654-8872-3","10.1109/NSS/MIC44845.2022.10399248","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10399248","","Training;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Statistical analysis;Parkinson's disease;Data mining;Diffusion tensor imaging","","2","","19","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The possibility of investigating possible changes in the activity of the brain caused by the levodopa administration may provide a useful tool to evaluate the influence or the side-effects of the treatment from patient to patient. The analysis was carried out through a systematic analysis of the fractal component of the subthalamic local field potentials (STN-LFP) that may reveal, with respect to the classical power spectrum analysis, novel important information about the dynamic modulation caused by the drug intake. Indeed, so far, much of what is known about that is related to the presence of a spectral peak in the beta frequency band then attenuated after the levodopa administration. The nonlinear power-law exponent goes beyond this feature, exploring differences that reflect the fractal (scale-free) behavior of the PD brain dynamics. Here, in order to demonstrate that the presence or absence of the peak has no effect on the computation of the power-law exponent, we used simulated LFP recordings. After that, we performed the fractal analysis in shorts epochs of STN LFPs recordings ($\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{24}$ patients, 12 females and 12 males) before and after Levodopa administration. We found no differences in the nonlinear power-law exponent for simulated data, reinforcing the idea that the parameter was not influenced by the attenuation of the hallmark peak for PD patients. As regard real LFP time series, we found that pharmacological treatment for PD differently altered LFP power of non-oscillatory activity, as well as changed the level of fractal exponent in specific frequency bands. Particularly we observed an increase of the fractal exponent in condition of post-levodopa with significant differences related to the response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease.

In this paper, the complexity of fluctuations in human walking stride records is analyzed to assess gait in healthy young, healthy older adults, and patients affected with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this regard, a nonlinear analysis of gait reliability is performed by measuring long-range dependence, chaos, and information content in walking stride records. We seek to test if changes in these measures of gait nonlinear patterns occur with age and pathology. The inferential analyses were conducted by employing various statistical tests. The obtained results show a strong evidence of significant group differences in the measured gait nonlinear patterns. More importantly, values of all the three complexity measures increase with age and occurrence of pathology. In addition, age and PD significantly affect gait nonlinear dynamics. In particular, age shapes randomness, while PD alters regularity and stability. Complexity measures considered in this paper provide new insights to better understand the biomechanics of walk due to aging. In addition, they appear to be valuable tools that can highlight differences in gait nonlinear dynamics with respect to PD patients. In this regard, the measurement of gait nonlinear patterns may possibly afford pertinent clinical information on neuromotor conditions, characterization of some neurological disorders, and rehabilitation.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2018.2866316","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8468117","Aging;gait;Hurst exponent (HE);Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC);Lyapunov exponent;Parkinson’s disease (PD)","Time series analysis;Legged locomotion;Complexity theory;Senior citizens;Parkinson's disease;Pathology","","37","","38","IEEE","19 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The majority of PD patients is associated with handwriting abnormalities called PD dysgraphia, which is linked with rigidity and bradykinesia of muscles involved in the handwriting process. One of the effective approaches of quantitative PD dysgraphia analysis is based on online handwriting processing. In the frame of this study we aim to deeply evaluate and optimize advanced PD handwriting quantification based on fractional order derivatives (FD). For this purpose, we used 37 PD patients and 38 healthy controls from the PaHaW (PD handwriting database). The FD based features were employed in classification and regression analysis (using gradient boosted trees), and evaluated in terms of their discrimination power and abilities to assess severity of PD. The results suggest that the most discriminative and descriptive information provide FD based features extracted from a repetitive loop task or a sentence copy task (maximum sensitivity/specificity = 76 %, error in severity assessment = 14 %, error in PD duration estimation = 22 %). Next, we identified two optimal ranges for the order of fractional derivative, α = 0.05-0.45 and α = 0.65-0.80. Finally, we observed that inclusion of pressure, azimuth, and tilt together with kinematic features into mathematical modeling has no influence (positive or negative) on classification performance, however, there was a notable improvement in the estimation of PD duration.","2076-1465","978-9-0827-9703-9","10.23919/EUSIPCO.2019.8903088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8903088","online handwriting;Parkinson’s disease;dysgraphia;fractal calculus;fractional derivatives;classification;regression","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Kinematics;Parkinson's disease;Databases;Regression analysis;Europe","","10","","24","","18 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, conventional tests consist of a series of spiral drawings, with the notion that the most prevalent PD symptoms directly impact the visual appearance of handwritten geometric dynamics. Current disease diagnosis methods rely heavily on a large amount of preexisting clinical data to train their models. However, the lack of sufficient labeled data samples in many diseases, including PD, makes it challenging to build robust predictive models, especially deep-learning ones. With measuring devices becoming more common and the continuous increase in processing power, industrial cyber-physical characterization is emerging as a key enabling technology for a wide range of fields. This article proposes an industrial cyber-physical deep meta-learning framework for diagnosing and monitoring PD patients based on metric learning that aims to train a reliable PD classifier with limited data. In particular, we present a component-based cyber-physical system architecture to combine contrastive learning with a CNN encoder to obtain unbiased feature embeddings and then use a Siamese network to finalize PD classification.

Cluster 2 was characterized by an increase of double support phase, stance phase and stance duration and a decrease of velocity, cadence, step and mean cycle length.

Multiple research works have aimed to automate and expedite the diagnostic process utilizing numerous Machine learning methods, however, mostly including single or two biomarkers. Hence, there is a diagnostic potential of integrating different biomarkers relevant to PD to enhance the accuracy and robustness. These biomarkers encompass different data forms, such as 1D signals, 2D images, and 3D scans. However, a significant challenge arises from the limited availability of comprehensive datasets. Many datasets do not contain all relevant biomarkers for the same set of subjects, limiting the ability to study them together. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a fusion-based federated learning approach by training separate models on different types of speech biomarkers sourced from different databases. The central server, which acts like a diagnostic centre, unifies insights from different speech biomarkers across multiple sites evaluating the relevance of other diverse biomarkers from various sources. Through this fusion federated framework, we achieve an 85% classification accuracy in PD diagnosis by effectively integrating different speech data types from multiple sources.

Welch's method was used to compute the power spectrum density at each EEG sub-band. It was shown that the alpha rhythm in PD patients was characterized by a higher relative power, while the beta and gamma rhythms exhibited lower relative powers as compared to the HC group. We applied the phase lag index (PLI) to quantify the phase synchronization of pair-wise channels at different sub-bands and then reconstructed the cross-band functional networks. We found that there were significantly different synchronization degrees in theta, alpha and beta bands between two groups. The phase synchronization between different regions of the whole brain in theta-alpha, alpha-delta, and beta-theta cross-band also showed significant abnormalities as compared to the HC group.

It integrates an innovative real-time assessment of the severity of motor symptoms based on signal processing and Machine Learning models that mimic the clinical severity classification scales used in practice and allows for a more continuous and personalized therapy planning and management by doctors, through the use of a web dashboard user-friendly interface. This system, recently tested at 5 patients' homes, has shown promising results as a PD patient management digital platform, reaching a usability score of 83.9% (A grade) based on the System Usability Scale (SUS). Such a level shows a strong alignment between user needs, expectations and functionalities. This study highlights the potential of the used system as a Patient Management Tool showing a case study from an ongoing clinical study.

Recently, a novel algorithm has proposed Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) as a valuable tool to assess in time-frequency domain the mean regions of muscle activation during walking. Thus, the objective of the present work is to achieve a reliable assessment of Gastrocnemius Lateralis-muscle behavior during PD walking, by adopting CWT to interpret sEMG signals. Onset and offset timing of activity and the occurrence frequency, a recently introduced parameter useful for characterizing muscle-recruitment variability, were computed. Results reported a statistically significant (p<0.05) delay of Gastrocnemius Lateralis activity in PD in the early-stance phase, while an anticipatory strategy was revealed at the late-swing phase, yet not significant. The occurrence frequency parameter displayed an inhomogeneous distribution of the activation occurrence in PD patients during gait cycle; the authors might speculate that this underling information could suggest that people with PD prefer adopting a simpler motor control. Besides the information achieved in time domain, availability of frequency content of sEMG signal could be a further advantage, since it might be adopted to detect modifications in the electrophysiological behavior in people with PD. Thus, further studies could be focused on the attempt to quantify this parameter during walking in PD.","","978-1-6654-8299-8","10.1109/MeMeA54994.2022.9856506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856506","Biomedical signal processing;surface EMG;Parkinson's disease;walking;wavelet","Legged locomotion;Time-frequency analysis;Motor drives;Continuous wavelet transforms;Parkinson's disease;Muscles;Time-domain analysis","","","","37","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study explores the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) to classify PD stages using both full-brain and cropped DaTSCAN volumes. The model was trained using 10-fold cross-validation with augmentation involving translation and rotation augmentations and evaluated based on many evaluation metrics. The results indicate that both full-sized and cropped datasets achieved high classification performance. The full-sized dataset exhibited clearer stage-specific differences, however the cropped dataset showed greater overlap in features. Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) analysis further confirmed that neurodegenerative changes extend beyond the striatum, reinforcing the importance of whole-brain analysis. These findings suggest that restricting Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to predefined regions may limit the identification of key imaging biomarkers for PD progression.

Early diagnosis and treatment of PD are crucial for alleviating symptoms and slowing disease progression. However, accurately diagnosing PD is challenging due to the overlap of its symptoms with those of other disorders. This study proposes a multimodal framework that leverages voice signals and handwritten graphics for the diagnosis of PD. The approach involves preprocessing and segmentation of speech signals to spectrogram and the binarization of handwritten graphics (circle, spiral, and meander) for analysis, incorporating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and an attention-based neural network model were trained on both datasets. The integration of speech signals and HandDraw images facilitated a comprehensive multimodal analysis. The proposed DCNN with an attention network achieved a classification accuracy of 98.75% on the multimodal dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches.

A difficult challenge for making sure that people can live as independently as feasible is the correct identification of PD in the initial stages. Over the past few decades, artificial intelligence-based machine learning techniques for disease identification in medicine have become very popular. These techniques do not, however, offer a precise and rapid diagnosis. The total detection precision of methods connected to machine learning was insufficient. Italian medical control individuals and PD sufferers, mid-advanced patients treated to L-Dopa, separated into non-medication patients and early-diagnosed, were used to create a custom dataset using high-quality recordings of vocal assignments. The goal is to construct an accurate model that can accurately diagnose to identify PD early and begin treatment while it is still treatable, early diagnostic tools are required. However, current models contain drawbacks that can cause the disease to be misdiagnosed. The Unified PDRating Scale (UPDRS), a grading system for PD, could be continuously monitored with the use of the proposed framework, which could aid clinicians treat patients. According to the various ML pipelines, state-of-the-art is contrasted using various categorization methods&DL was also investigated utilizing a unique Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework. Outcomes demonstrate that KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes classifiers operate comparably to each other with KNN having a little advantage over SVM and DL in terms of categorization outcomes. The dominance of CFS as the top characteristic choice is much clearer. The chosen characteristics serve as pertinent vocal biomarkers that can distinguish between healthy people, early-stage PD patients who have not yet received treatment, and mid-advanced PD patients who have received L-Dopa. The proposed approach has a 0.10 RMSE error, which is less than that of current models and can identify PD. The recommended method can extract crucial vocal elements that can be used to identify PD early on.","","979-8-3503-4279-6","10.1109/ICAEECI58247.2023.10370827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10370827","Deep Learning;Machine Learning;Performance Measures;Parkinson Disease;Vocal biomarkers","Support vector machines;Parkinson's disease;Pipelines;Electric variables measurement;Biomarkers;Recording;Naive Bayes methods","","","","16","IEEE","3 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, gait parameters are collected from 200 PD patients and 100 healthy controls (HC) through the wearable sensors, which include 95 features. Considering the redundancy between the features, F -test and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) methods are utilized for feature selection.

Significant differences in gait parameters between ON and OFF states were observed, particularly in gyroscope spectral range, step duration asymmetry, RMS of acceleration, and harmonic ratios. Four machine learning models, were trained to classify the medication states.

The physicians usually quantify these motor disturbances by assigning a severity score according to validated but time-consuming clinical scales such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) - part III. These clinical ratings are however prone to subjectivity and inter-rater variability. The PD medical community is therefore looking for a faster and more objective rating method. As a first step towards this goal, a tri-axial accelerometer-based system is proposed as patients are engaged in a repetitive finger tapping task, which is classically used to assess bradykinesia in the UPDRS-III. After developing the hardware, an algorithm has been developed, that automatically epoched the signal on a trial-by-trial basis and quantified, among others, movement speed, amplitude, hesitations or halts as validated by visual inspection of video recordings during the task. The results obtained in a PD patient and an healthy volunteer are presented.

"ParkinSense: A Novel Approach to Remote Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis, Severity Profiling, and Telemonitoring via Ensemble Learning and Multimodal Data Fusion on Webcam-Derived Digital Biomarkers","P. Paruchuri","Heritage High School, Frisco, Texas",2022 7th International Conference on Intelligent Informatics and Biomedical Science (ICIIBMS),"12 Dec 2022","2022","7","","359","366","Despite being the fastest growing Neurodegenerative disease in the world, with over ten million cases worldwide, there is no definitive diagnosis method for Parkinson’s Disease currently. Current diagnosis technologies misdiagnose one in four patients, relying on tests and technologies that are subjective to the administrating clinicians. Furthermore, they are inaccessible to billions due to immobility, geographic barriers, or associated costs. With early and accurate diagnosis being vital to effective treatment, a tremendous issue emerges. ParkinSense addresses these issues, serving as an automated web application that contactlessly analyzes three cardinal symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease over a standard webcam and microphone: Hypomimia, Dysarthria, and Bradykinesia. With Ensemble Learning coupled with various classifiers, ParkinSense was able to achieve an accuracy rate of 99.72% when tested on synthetic patients. By examining and combining multiple modalities, ParkinSense boasts accuracy rates higher than many advanced unimodal technologies, as patients often do not substantially display all the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, leading to misdiagnosis when relying on one symptom for diagnosis. Furthermore, ParkinSense is able to accurately estimate disease severity for positively diagnosed patients, with a Mean Absolute Error of 9.7 on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. ParkinSense strongly suggests that an entirely contactless diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease through digital biomarkers can be effective, and web applications can be utilized for rapid, automated, and remote diagnosis and severity analysis, which can be crucial for those affected by barriers that prevent access to healthcare.","2189-8723","978-1-6654-8229-5","10.1109/ICIIBMS55689.2022.9971545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9971545","Diagnosis;Machine learning;Multimodal learning;Parkinson’s disease;Severity","Costs;Webcams;Biological system modeling;Biomarkers;Data models;Software;Ensemble learning","","2","","55","IEEE","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Results with three PD patients have been encouraging, with all three showing a marked reduction of their tremor during the intervention with entrainment at approximately 10 Hz. However, in control sessions where stimuli presented no entraining oscillations, a very similar pattern of reduction in tremor was observed.

Three tremor symptom dominant PD patients performed tasks of targeted forward reaching movements with background tremor. Kinematics and surface electromyography (EMG) of six muscles were recorded. Synergy vectors and time profiles were analyzed using EMG data during resting tremor and forward reaching. Results revealed that the representative vector of tremor remained unchanged during performance of voluntary movement. Other synergy vectors of tremor were modified to accommodate vectors of movement synergies. The merge of tremor module with movement module could be explained by a procedure of linear combination. The distribution of timing of movement initiation with respect to tremor cycle displayed a weak sign of clusters.

Our methodology leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are 90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%.

The disease seems to develop as brain neurons generating dopamine start to fail, hence impairing regulation of smooth muscle. Early detection of motor signs of Parkinson's disease enables a patient to get suitable treatment at the right time. This paper contrasts logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) in terms of their relative appropriateness as machine learning techniques for diagnosing Parkinson disease. Among the many clinical and demographic information about the study dataset participants, voice measures are among them. Composed of 31 individuals, 23 of whom have Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the speech feature data utilized to identify the illness include MDVP: Fo (Hz), MDVP: Fhi (Hz), himmer: DDA, and many more. Though K-Nearest neighbor algorithm beat Logistic Regression by reaching 86% accuracy, preliminary findings indicate that both Logistic Regression and K- Nearest Neighbor can differentiate between people with Parkinson disease and healthy individuals. The results imply that KNN and Logistic Regression are possible predictive techniques for Parkinson disease. The research indicates that early detection of Parkinson's disease may benefit greatly from machine learning techniques.","2996-4490","979-8-3315-3103-4","10.1109/INCET64471.2025.11140817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11140817","Health;machine learning;diagnosis;disability;medical;healthy lives;KNN","Logistic regression;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Neurons;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor methods;Muscles;Prediction algorithms;Particle measurements;Regulation","","","","15","IEEE","4 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Symptoms of Parkinson's disease start to appear once about 80 percent of neurons are damaged. One in 100 people over the age of 60 years develop it, and the average age is 60 years. The risk of Parkinson's disease rises steadily with age. An estimated 60,000 new cases of Parkinson's disease are diagnosed yearly in the United States, and there are 1.5 million Americans who currently have the disease. Biomarkers derived from human voice are based on cognitive and neuromuscular functions, which can be an indication of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease. Approximately one million people living in the United States are victims of this condition, which is a neurodegenerative progressive disorder; about sixty thousand new clinical diagnoses are annually reported. Traditionally, it is very hard to quantify Parkinson's disease, and doctors usually focus their attention on some symptoms while others are ignored, based mostly on subjective rating scales. Voice can be a way for the detection and diagnosis of the disease because of the reduction of motor control that characterizes the disease. With day-to-day improvement in technology, besides the presence of audio-collecting devices in everyday life, good models that can translate this audio data into a diagnostic tool for health professionals can give probably cheaper and more accurate diagnoses. In this paper we provide evidence that will serve to validate this idea using a voice dataset collected from people with and without Parkinson's disease. This paper seeks to investigate the efficiency of the supervised classification algorithm, namely deep neural networks, for the diagnosis of people afflicted with a disease. The highest achieved accuracy with machine learning models is 85%, superior to the average non-expert clinical diagnosis of 73.8% and the average of movement disorder specialists at 79.6% w/o follow-up and 83.9% after follow-up with ground truth pathological post-mortem examination.","","979-8-3503-5561-1","10.1109/ICAET63349.2025.10932276","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10932276","Parkinosn disease (AD);Machine Learning;biomarkers","Pathology;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Neurons;Imaging;Machine learning;Biomarkers;Sensitivity and specificity;Optimization;Diseases","","","","16","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Exercise compliance is also affected by a loss of memory and decline in motivation in prescribed home-based balance training. We have developed the smarter balance system (SBS) incorporating multimodal biofeedback (visual plus vibrotactile) intended for clinical and home-based balance rehabilitation and assessed its efficacy on physical therapists' recommended dynamic weight-shifting balance exercises (dynamic WSBE) in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). The SBS consists of a smartphone and custom belt housing a processing unit, miniaturized sensors, and vibrating actuators (tactors). Visual and vibrotactile biofeedback guidance during dynamic WSBE is generated by the SBS's custom app based on 90% of the user's limits of stability (LOS). Ten individuals with idiopathic PD having impaired postural stability participated in one unsupervised session comprising 24 trials of the dynamic WSBE in a laboratory setting. Participants' limits of stability (LOS) in the anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral (M/L) direction were measured at the pre- and post-session. To assess the efficacy of SBS to provide guidance during balance rehabilitation using dynamic WSBE, cross-correlation (XCOR), position error (PE), and percent of tactor activation (PTA) were measured. There was a significant increase in LOS between the pre- and post-training session in both A/P and M/L directions. The average XCOR across all participants were 0.87 (SD = 0.11) and 0.76 (SD = 0.11) for the A/P and M/L direction respectively. The average PE and PTA for the A/P direction was 1.17 deg (SD = 0.60) and 65.35% (SD = 15.1) respectively and 0.74 deg (SD = 0.28) and 31.3% (SD = 16.42) in the M/L direction respectively. There was no significant effect of trials for XCOR, PE, and PTA. Participants' LOS significantly increased after one session of the dynamic WSBE. Individuals with PD could accurately follow the target movements during the dynamic WSBE using the SBS. Future studies will assess the efficacy and acceptability of the SBS during long-term in-home rehabilitative training for balance-impaired individuals.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2018.2808139","Research Grant under the American Parkinson’s Disease Association; ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP(grant numbers:2017-0-01724); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8295144","Smartphone;visual biofeedback;vibrotactile biofeedback;continuous coding scheme;weight-shifting balance exercise;balance rehabilitation;Parkinson’s disease;elderly","Biological control systems;Visualization;Belts;Encoding;Diseases;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","Aged;Algorithms;Biofeedback, Psychology;Biomechanical Phenomena;Exercise Therapy;Female;Humans;Male;Parkinson Disease;Physical Therapy Modalities;Postural Balance;Smartphone;Touch;Vision, Ocular","18","","56","OAPA","19 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most recent researches simplified the finger tapping motion as a scissors-like motion, though the rotation axis of the thumb was different from that of the forefinger. In this paper, we proposed a three-dimensional (3-D) finger tapping measurement system to obtain 3-D pattern features in finger tapping test for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The proposed system collected the motion of the thumb and the forefinger by nine-degrees-freedom sensors and calculated 3-D motion of finger tapping by an orientation estimation method and a 3-D finger-tapping kinematic model. We further extracted 3-D pattern features, i.e. motor coordination and relative thumb motion, from 3-D Finger Tapping motion. Moreover, we used the proposed system to collect the finger-tapping motion of 43 PD patients and 30 healthy controls in horizontal tasks and vertical tasks. The results indicated that 3-D pattern features showed a better performance than one-dimensional features in the identification of mild PD patients.Clinical Relevance— These three-dimensional pattern features could be used to evaluate finger tapping motion in a novel way, which could be used to better identify mild Parkinson’s disease patients. Furthermore, the results showed that a combination of horizontal tasks and vertical tasks might be a better way to identify mild Parkinson’s disease patients.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9176652","","Thumb;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Magnetic sensors;Accelerometers","Biomechanical Phenomena;Fingers;Humans;Motion;Parkinson Disease;Thumb","7","","17","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tremor, stiffness, difficulty in movement and difficulty of walking are the most prominent symptoms in the initial stages. There is presently no treatment for PD. Doctors often describe a variety of motor symptoms to establish a diagnosis of PD. Traditional techniques of diagnosis, on the other hand, may be susceptible to inaccuracy since they rely on subjective assessment of movements that human eyes might find difficult to recognize. However, early non-motor indications of Parkinson's disease can be subtle and caused by a wide range of health conditions other than Parkinson's disease. As a result, early detection of Parkinson's disease is difficult because these symptoms are frequently ignored. In addition, there are no completely trustworthy diagnostic techniques available. To overcome the problem, - Machine Learning (ML) approaches to gait data is proposed in this study. The process of solution contains five sections: 1) Genuine gait data is collected from standard websites, 2) The collected data is processed to clean it, which contains smoothing and outliers removal techniques, 3) The processed data is further given to the feature extraction technique to get important attributes, 4) The extracted features are applied on the ML models namely Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT), 5) Finally, the model is validated using metrics to identify best ML model.","","978-1-6654-6084-2","10.1109/ICACRS55517.2022.10029281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10029281","Parkinson;Statistics;Smoothing;Outlier;Machine Learning Model;Accuracy","Measurement;Smoothing methods;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Data models","","3","","17","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is crucial since (i) Classifying the degree of Parkinson's disease is an important clinical necessity. (ii) The lack of such an automated system leaves current clinical methodology to use manual and subjective classification by a trained clinician. In earlier work, two of the authors of this paper have shown that, directly from the speech signal, reliable classification as to the presence of the disease can be produced using a machine learning approach. However, this approach was unable to reliably classify the severity degree of the disease. In other work, a deep (convolutional) neural network was tried on the same data set (albeit without feature extraction), which again did not succeed on the multi-label case. In this work, we applied a data science approach to solve this problem by analysing the topological structure of the label space and the internal topological structure of the data. Specifically we explored using (i) the linearity of the label-space to reduce the inherent noise in multi-class classifiers and (ii) to break the data into separate topological clusters (by using a version of unsupervised topological learning) and then applying separate classification parametrizations for each cluster. While our interest was mainly directed to the Parkinson's classification problem, the methods seem relatively generic and should be applicable to many data sets. (As an example, we also applied this directly to a well-known baseline data set - wine classification and obtained state of the art results). On the Parkinson classification task, these methods obtained, on a 7 degree classification scale, results which are comparable to the best accuracy on simple two class classification.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-1985-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8852088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8852088","Parkinson’s disease;Kohonen;SOM;Topological Clustering;Multi-Class Classification;Speech Signal Analysis","Parkinson's disease;Topology;Training;Time-frequency analysis;Neural networks;Machine learning","","3","","21","IEEE","30 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This neurodegenerative disease is generally caused by the deficiency of dopamine-developing nerve cells in the brain. The primary symptom of PD is a tremor, or shaking, in one or both hands. Other symptoms may include harshness of the limbs and trunk, slow movement (bradykinesia), poor balance and coordination, and a change in speech or writing (dysarthria or micrographia). As the senior citizen population is mounting, the patients of Parkinson's are also increasing. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no effective treatment for Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the task at hand is to enhance the timely identification of the illness. This research study has developed a novel 2D convolutional neural network to learn the intricate patterns in three different types of MR Images (MRI) to detect Parkinson's disease, which is thought to be brought on by minor, undetected strokes in the brain or the severity of white matter lesions, using a sizable dataset available on Kaggle. Through this model, a high accuracy of 94% has been achieved. Next, transfer learning is applied by using InceptionV3. The proposed model demonstrates an overall accuracy of 95.29% by leveraging a pre-trained model.

This research leverages deep learning methods and explainable AI to enhance diagnostic procedures, facilitating the early identification and treatment of Parkinson's disease. The objective of our project is to develop a web-based system to detect Parkinson's disease using deep learning and explainable AI for highly accurate and interpretable results. We utilized the VGG19 model to train on our hand-drawn spiral dataset. Additionally, we incorporated MRI data, employing a pre-trained VIT model to further improve the diagnostic accuracy. For the implementation of our proposed model, we used Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, and for our website, we used Streamlit. We achieved an overall accuracy of 97% and a 10% loss for the hand-drawn spiral dataset & 99% accuracy and 1% loss for the MRI dataset on our validation set after model training. To ensure the interpretability of our model's predictions, we integrated explainable AI techniques, specifically using LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations).

In recent years, the utilization of machine learning methods to enhance the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) has gained significant interest. The study proposes an innovative technique for PD detection by integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with handwriting and voice signatures. Initially, stroke features are extracted from handwriting samples, followed by retrieving acoustic features from speech recordings. These extracted features are then used to construct graphs representing each modality's temporal and spatial interactions. The GCN architecture is specifically tailored to process graph-structured data through convolutional and pooling operations. Additionally, to enhance model efficacy, the research investigates the inclusion of attention mechanisms. To enhance model performance, we also investigate integrating attention mechanisms to boost model performance. The experimental results highlight the non-invasive nature and early diagnosis potential of our approach by demonstrating its ability to reliably detect PD using handwriting along with voice data. This research has the potential to revolutionize the early PD diagnosis, leading to more effective management and treatment. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method in accurately detecting Parkinson's disease using handwriting and voice data, with a focus on its non-invasive nature and potential for early diagnosis. With an accuracy of 99.8%, our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, offering great promise for improving early detection and management of Parkinson's disease.","","979-8-3315-0410-6","10.1109/CINS63881.2024.10864454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10864454","Parkinson's disease;Graph Convolutional Networks;Handwriting analysis;Voice analysis;Early detection;Neurodegenerative disorders","Measurement;Attention mechanisms;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Graph convolutional networks;Feature extraction;Recording;Reliability;Data mining;Network systems","","","","20","IEEE","10 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is characterized by the depletion of mesenchephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatal dopamine. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease where DA neurons are especially vulnerable to excessive production of the H2O2 reactive oxygen species. Unfortunately, the first clinical symptoms of PD occur after at least 60-80% of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons have lost their function. Therefore, early detection of PD is critical in slowing down the progression of the disease and enabling the development of therapeutic compounds which could intervene at an earlier stage. Here, we employ in vivo molecular imaging of astrocytic retinal gliosis in a transgenic mice to longitudinally monitor the progression of MPTP-induced PD. We have quantitatively evaluated, via this imaging platform, the efficacy of a synthetic antioxidant, 1,3- bisbenzylimidazolium bromide (DBZIM), in protecting the DA neurons and scavenging the ROS. We show here that MPTPinduced PD results in an upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for gliosis, by 36% relative to saline whereas gliosis is normalized in MPTP-induced PD mice treated with DBZIM.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626122","","Retina;Mice;Imaging;In vivo;Neurons;Parkinson's disease;Fluorescence","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine;Animals;Disease Progression;Dopamine Agents;Genotype;Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein;Gliosis;Green Fluorescent Proteins;Imidazoles;Immunohistochemistry;Mice;Mice, Transgenic;Oxidative Stress;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Reactive Oxygen Species;Retina","2","","18","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stimulation parameters that maximized activation of a theoretically defined target region were determined via patient-specific computer models created in Cicerone. Postural stability was assessed under three conditions: Off DBS, Clinical DBS, and Model DBS. Clinical settings were the patients' DBS settings determined via traditional clinical practice and were considered optimized and stable for at least 6 months prior to study enrollment. Blinded and randomized evaluations were performed in five patients. Postural sway was significantly less during Model DBS compared to Clinical DBS. These results support the hypothesis that minimizing spread of current to non-motor territories of the STN can improve PD related instability with DBS.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1589-1","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6090151","","Satellite broadcasting;Stability analysis;Brain stimulation;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Programming;Biological system modeling","Aged;Computer Simulation;Deep Brain Stimulation;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Postural Balance;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","6","3","4","IEEE","1 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In total, 108 (98 patients in different stages of PD and 10 healthy elderly subjects) performed repeated spiral drawing tasks in their home environments using a touch screen device. A score was developed for representing the amount of temporal irregularity during spiral drawing tasks, using Approximate Entropy (ApEn) technique. In addition, two previously published spiral scoring methods were adapted and their scores were analyzed. The mean temporal irregularity score differed significantly between healthy elderly subjects and advanced PD patients (P<;0.005). The ApEn-based method had a better responsiveness and test-retest reliability when compared to the other two methods. In contrast to the other methods, the mean scores of the ApEn-based method improved significantly during a 3 year clinical study, indicating a possible impact of pathological basal ganglia oscillations in temporal control during spiral drawing tasks. In conclusion, the ApEn-based method could be used for differentiating between patients in different stages of PD and healthy subjects. The responsiveness and test-retest reliability were good for the ApEn-based method indicating that this method is useful for measuring upper limb temporal irregularity at a micro-level.","2168-2208","978-1-5090-2455-1","10.1109/BHI.2016.7455921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7455921","","Spirals;Senior citizens;Performance evaluation;Reliability;Timing;Standards;Radio frequency","","7","","12","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This could bring adverse effects to patients due to possible overstimulation. Thus closed-loop DBS of which stimulation parameters are automatically adjusted based on variations in the ongoing neurophysiological signals is desired. In this paper, we present a closed-loop DBS method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to regulate stimulation parameters based on a computational model.

Determining the dosage of levodopa requires regular meetings where motor function can be observed. Speech impairment is an early symptom in PD and has been proposed for early detection and monitoring of the disease. However, findings from previous research on the effect of levodopa on speech have not shown a consistent picture. Method: This study has investigated the effect of medication on PD patients for three sustained phonemes; /a/, /o/, and /m/, which were recorded from 24 PD patients during medication off and on stages, and from 22 healthy participants. The differences were statistically investigated, and the features were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The results show that medication has a significant effect on the change of time and amplitude perturbation (jitter and shimmer) and harmonics of /m/, which was the most sensitive individual phoneme to the levodopa response. /m/ and /o/ performed at a comparable level in discriminating PD-off from control recordings. However, SVM classifications based on the combined use of the three phonemes /a/, /o/, and /m/ showed the best classifications, both for medication effect and for separating PD from control voice. The SVM classification for PD-off versus PD-on achieved an AUC of 0.81. Conclusion: Studies of phonation by computerized voice analysis in PD should employ recordings of multiple phonemes.

This task is usually assessed with clinical scales suffering from partial subjectivity and limited detail in evaluating different task aspects. In this paper, we instrumented the assessment of stair ascent in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke (ST), and Parkinson’s disease (PD) to analyze the validity of the proposed quantitative indexes and characterize subjects’ performances. Participants climbed 10 steps wearing a magneto-inertial sensor [magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU)] at sternum level. Gait pattern features (step frequency, symmetry, regularity, and harmonic ratios), and upper trunk sway were computed from MIMU signals. Clinical modified dynamic gait index (mDGI) and mDGI-Item 8 “Up stairs” were administered. Significant correlations with clinical scores were found for gait pattern features ( $\text {r}_{\text {s}} \ge {0.536}$ ) and trunk pitch sway ( $\text {r}_{\textsf {s}} \le -{0.367}$ ) demonstrating their validity. Instrumental indexes showed alterations in the three pathological groups compared to healthy subjects and significant differences, not clinically detected, among MS, ST, and PD. MS showed the worst performance, with alterations of all gait pattern aspects and larger trunk pitch sway. ST showed worsening in gait pattern features but not in trunk motion. PD showed fewer alterations consisting in reduced step frequency and trunk yaw sway. These results suggest that the use of an MIMU provided valid objective indexes revealing between-group differences in stair ascent not detected by clinical scales.

The aim of this study was to develop data-driven methods and test their clinimetric properties to detect and quantify PD motor states using motion sensor data from leg agility tests. Nineteen PD patients were recruited in a levodopa single dose challenge study. PD patients performed leg agility tasks while wearing motion sensors on their lower extremities. Clinical evaluation of video recordings was performed by three movement disorder specialists who used four items from the motor section of the unified PD rating scale (UPDRS), the treatment response scale (TRS) and a dyskinesia score. Using the sensor data, spatiotemporal features were calculated and relevant features were selected by feature selection. Machine learning methods like support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and linear regression, using ten-fold cross validation were trained to predict motor states of the patients. SVM showed the best convergence validity with correlation coefficients of 0.81 to TRS, 0.83 to UPDRS #31 (body bradykinesia and hypokinesia), 0.78 to SUMUPDRS (the sum of the UPDRS items: #26-leg agility, #27-arising from chair, and #29-gait), and 0.67 to dyskinesia. Additionally, the SVM-based scores had similar test-retest reliability in relation to clinical ratings. The SVM-based scores were less responsive to treatment effects than the clinical scores, particularly with regards to dyskinesia. In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that using motion sensors during leg agility tests may lead to valid and reliable objective measures of PD motor symptoms.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2898332","Swedish Knowledge Foundation; Swedish Innovation Agency; Acreo; Cenvigo; Sensidose; Uppsala Universitet; Örebro University; Högskolan Dalarna; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637809","Leg agility;Parkinson's disease;support vector machine;stepwise regression;predictive models","Legged locomotion;Diseases;Foot;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Standards;Acceleration","Aged;Exercise Test;Female;Gait;Humans;Levodopa;Lower Extremity;Male;Models, Statistical;Monitoring, Physiologic;Parkinson Disease;Support Vector Machine;Wearable Electronic Devices","22","","39","IEEE","8 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pathologically enhanced beta-band (13–35 Hz) oscillatory activity across the cortico-basal ganglia pathways is a prominent neurophysiological phenomenon associated with PD. We hypothesized that weighing together beta-band frequency peaks from simultaneous microelectrode recordings in “off-state” PD patients could map the individual neuroanatomical variability and serve as a biomarker for the location of the STN sensorimotor neurons. We validated our hypothesis with 9 and 11 patients that, respectively, responded well and poorly to bilateral DBS, after at least two years of follow up. We categorized “good” and “poor” DBS responders based on their clinical assessment alongside a > 40% and <30% change, respectively, in “off” unified PD rating scale motor scores. Good (poor) DBS responders had, in average, 1 mm (3.5 mm) vertical distance between the maximum beta-peak weighted across the parallel microelectrodes and the center of the stimulation area. The distances were statistically different in the two groups ($p = 0.0025$ ). Our biomarker could provide personalized intra- and postoperative support in stimulating the STN sensorimotor area associated with optimal long-term clinical benefits.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2014.2344102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868185","Beta-band oscillations;clinical biomarker;deep brain stimulation (DBS);neuromodulation;Parkinson's disease (PD)","Satellite broadcasting;Microelectrodes;Diseases;Surgery;Oscillators;Trajectory","Beta Rhythm;Biomarkers;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Humans;Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring;Movement Disorders;Parkinson Disease;Prosthesis Implantation;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subthalamic Nucleus;Treatment Outcome","20","","52","IEEE","30 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes a new data analysis approach that can be used along with two wearable IMU (inertial measurement units) sensors to continuously assess motor fluctuations in PD patients while moving in their natural environment. We hypothesized that joint analysis of the sensor data in its spectral, temporal and sensor domain could generate multilevel features that can be used to detect PD-related patterns successfully as the subject's motor state fluctuates between medication ON and OFF states. For this purpose, we utilized time-frequency (TF) representation and multiway data analysis tools (i.e., tensor decomposition) to decompose the TF representation of the two sensors' data into its multilevel structures, which were next used to extract multilevel features representing the PD symptoms in different medication states. The extracted multilevel features were used in a classification model based on support vector machine to detect medication ON and OFF states. For comparison purposes, we implemented a traditional feature extraction method. We also developed a hierarchical feature extraction method based on the combination of those two methods. The performances of the three methods were evaluated using a dataset of 19 PD subjects with a total duration of 17.54 hours. The multilevel features achieved 8.25% improvement in the accuracy over the traditional features, and the hierarchical features resulted in 10.73% improvement indicating that our approach holds great promise to continuously detect medication states from continuous monitoring of the subjects' movement.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Parkinson’s disease assessment framework in free-living environment. Specifically, clustering methods are used to learn latent categories from the same activities, and use Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models to capture latent features of multiple activities. Then, to mitigate the impact of data imbalance, we augment bag-level data while retaining key instance prototypes. The new framework is applied to a PD dataset collected by wearable sensors in the wild. It achieves an impressive 73.49% accuracy in the fine-grained (normal, mild, moderate, severe) classification of PD severity based on hand movements.

Key discriminative features included turn duration, sit-to-stand time, and stand-to-sit time, which demonstrated potential as objective digital biomarkers for early-stage Parkinson’s disease detection. Additionally, higher motor impairment scores were associated with increased shank range of motion and prolonged turn duration, particularly during dual-task conditions.

Correspondingly, inertial sensing-based wearable devices (ISWDs) produce objective and standardized quantifications. However, ISWDs indirectly quantify symptoms by parametric modeling of angular velocities and linear accelerations nd trained by the judgments of several neurologists through supervised learning algorithms. Hence, the ISWD outputs are biased along with the scores provided by neurologists. To investigate the effectiveness ISWDs for Parkinsonian symptoms quantification, technical verification and clinical validation of both tremor and bradykinesia quantification methods were carried out. A total of 45 Parkinson's disease patients and 30 healthy controls performed the tremor and finger-tapping tasks, which were tracked simultaneously by an ISWD and a 6-axis high-precision electromagnetic tracking system (EMTS). The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) prescribed parameters obtained from the EMTS, which directly provides linear and rotational displacements, were compared with the scores provided by both the ISWD and seven neurologists. EMTS-based parameters were regarded as the ground truth and were employed to train several common machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF) algorithms. Inconsistency among the scores provided by the neurologists was proven. Besides, the quantification performance (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) of the ISWD employed with ML algorithms were better than that of the neurologists. Furthermore, EMTS can be utilized to both modify the quantification algorithms of ISWDs and improve the assessment skills of young neurologists.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2020.3009319","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973293); Joint Funds for the Innovation of Science and Technology of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2017Y9010); Key Project of Foreign Cooperation for the International Partner Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:121835KYSB20190069); Quanzhou Science and Technology(grant numbers:2019STS06/2019C012R); Science and Technology Program of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2018H2001); Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Guiding Project(grant numbers:2018Y0033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9141393","Bradykinesia;electromagnetic tracking;inertial sensing;Parkinson's disease;tremor","Sensors;Task analysis;Thumb;Diseases;Medical diagnostic imaging;Magnetosphere","Humans;Hypokinesia;Parkinson Disease;Support Vector Machine;Tremor;Wearable Electronic Devices","52","","42","IEEE","15 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, we particularly focus on data-driven parcellation studies in this disease, providing researchers with a comprehensive overview of PD-specific atlases and their applications. We show that, while many advances have been achieved, heterogeneity in the PD population still provides an ongoing challenge to find a robust consensus on regional representation. Although some parcellation-driven studies exhibit encouraging achievements, these PD-specific parcellations are still limited and most approaches depend on a single modality.

To enhance parcellation performance, here we propose a deep embedded connectivity-based parcellation (DECBP) framework and apply it to determine functional subdivisions of the striatum in public resting state fMRI data sets. This framework integrates fMRI connectivity features into deep embedded clustering (DEC), a deep neural network based on a stacked autoencoder. Compared to three prevalent clustering methods and their combinations with principal component analysis (PCA), the DECBP exhibited a significantly higher similarity between scans, individuals, and groups, indicating enhanced reproducibility. The generated reliable parcellations were also largely consistent with other public atlases. We further explored the functional subunits in the striatum in a data set from 23 Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects and 27 age-matched healthy controls (HC). All putaminal subregions of PD demonstrated lower interhemispheric connectivity than those of HC, which might reflect imbalance in the pathological progression of PD. Such hypo-connectivity was also observed between putaminal subregions and other brain regions, reflecting neuroimaging manifestations of the altered cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit. These observed weaker couplings were associated with PD severity and duration. Our results support the utilization of the DECBP framework and suggest that abnormal connectivity in putaminal subregions may be a potential indicator of PD.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3083879","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922075); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC1312001,2017YFC0840105); USTC Research Funds of the Double First-Class Initiative(grant numbers:YD2100002004); Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2019-025); John Nichol Chair in Parkinson's Research (MJM); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442339","Resting-state fMRI;deep neural network;deep embedded connectivity-based parcellation;parkinson's disease","Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Diseases;Head;Correlation;Clustering methods;Bioinformatics;Reliability","Brain Mapping;Cluster Analysis;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Pathways;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results","10","","54","IEEE","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying GIF has been limited by difficulties in eliciting and objectively characterizing such gait phenomena in the clinical setting. Studies investigating the effects of GIF on brain activity using EEG offer the potential to study such behavior. In this preliminary study, we present a novel methodology where wavelet transform was used for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine for classifying GIF events in five patients with PD and FOG.

Symptoms usually appear gradually over time. Researchers are seeking biomarkers for Parkinson's disease in the hopes of allowing for earlier detection and more tailored treatments to slow the disease's progression. Existing methods of diagnosis include Blood tests, MRI scans, and PET scans. However, these are highly time and resource-consuming. PD also shows an amble change in the voice patterns of a person. Hence, acoustic analysis of voice signals can indicate the progression of PD. This can be analysed using a trained classifier model, which provides an easy diagnosis of the disease. This paper analyses the performance of AI-ML models viz- Linear regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbourhood (KNN), Ran-dom Forest, and XG Boost for the detection of Parkinson's disease using vocal feature sets. Experimental evaluations show that the Random Forest model produced an impressive accuracy of 100%. The classification algorithms' accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) are all examined.

In recent years, there has been much research about the link between Parkinson's disease (PD) and speech impairment in order to provide an early diagnosis of the disease and create a system for remote monitoring of patients as well. Many studies have used signal and speech processing techniques to convert acoustic signals into vectors of features which are then mapped into different machine learning algorithms. The results obtained in PD telemedicine studies have shown that the choice of feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms directly influence the accuracy and reliability of the proposed system. This article provides a system to assess the speech disorders in the context of PD using features extracted from three domains (time/frequency, cepstral, and wavelet domain) and machine learning tools. Our goal is to assess the ability of each individual to distinguish those with Parkinson's disease from healthy people. The results suggest that cepstral domain gives the most reliable parametrization comparable to time/frequency and wavelet domain with a high accuracy using Support Vector Machine classifier.","","978-1-7281-7668-0","10.1109/ISIVC49222.2021.9487544","CNRST; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9487544","Parkinson's disease;speech processing;machine learning;feature extraction;feature selection","Wavelet domain;Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Cepstral analysis;Telemedicine;Machine learning;Tools","","3","","21","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lack of specific clinical tests to accurately diagnose Parkinson's Disease poses a challenge in early detection. PD is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, along with additional motor deficiencies like handwriting problems and speech impairments. Another defining characteristic, often present in the early stages, is hypomimia, a decrease in facial expressiveness. Early detection is crucial to initiate timely therapy and prevent further damage. However, diagnosing PD in its early stages is challenging due to subtle symptoms that can mimic other conditions, and the absence of specific diagnostic tests. Various techniques including machine learning and deep learning approaches utilizing hand-drawn wave and spiral images, facial photographs, and voice recordings as potential biomarkers for PD detection. In our study, we applied convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze spiral and wave drawings, achieving an accuracy of 85% for spirals and 80% for waves. Additionally, we utilized a support vector machine (SVM) for facial analysis, obtaining an accuracy of 71%. However, it should be noted that the accuracy of facial analysis was limited due to the small dataset size. Lastly, for voice recordings, we employed XGBoost and achieved an impressive accuracy of 97%. Our results demonstrate promising accuracy for spiral, wave, and voice-based detection, highlighting the potential of machine learning techniques in PD diagnosis. The integration of biomarkers such as imaging and biological markers holds further potential for enhancing diagnostic capabilities in Parkinson's Disease.","","979-8-3503-0623-1","10.1109/MIUCC58832.2023.10278311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10278311","K-Nearest Neighbors;Parkinson's Disease;Spiral;and Wave Test","Deep learning;Support vector machines;Spirals;Parkinson's disease;Speech recognition;Biomarkers;Writing","","2","","11","IEEE","20 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, there are no reliable or easily accessed diagnostic tools for non-specialist healthcare providers that support early diagnosis of PD which causes delays in diagnosis and increases misclassification. This work proposes an early detection framework based on machine learning techniques that can provide more accurate diagnoses and reduce errors. More specifically, the suggested approach uses Decision Trees and K-means clustering to analyze the patient's data derived from a voice recording dataset, from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, then the accuracy for this K-Means clustering includes 97.15% and datasets from spiral drawings, where the Feature Extraction is conducted on the spiral drawings using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The system classifies a person as having Parkinson's Disease only if abnormalities are detected in both voice and drawing datasets; and it classifies, if neither datasets show signs of symptomatology the person is deemed healthy. Linear Regression is used for the final classification. The suggested multi-modal diagnostic model shows promise for reliable early-stage Parkinson's Disease detection that increases the chance of getting timely treatment and improves patient outcomes.","","979-8-3315-3830-9","10.1109/ICICI65870.2025.11069864","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11069864","Decision trees;K-means clustering;PCA;Parkinson's disease","Spirals;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Reviews;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Reproducibility of results;Reliability;Decision trees;Principal component analysis","","","","16","IEEE","15 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that impacts the neurological, physiological, and behavioral systems of the brain. Slow movement, known as bradykinesia, is a prevalent sign of this illness. Symptoms start to show up in midlife and get worse over time. A change in speech patterns is one of the earliest indicators of Parkinson's disease. In this study, it was proposed to diagnose subjective diseases using supervised classification techniques such k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and naïve Bayes (NB). To increase robustness beyond what a single model might provide, we have employed a method known as ensembling. Ensemble learning trains numerous models and then integrates their predictions, as opposed to relying solely on one model. This paper investigates four distinct ensemble algorithms: Adaboost, bagging, majority voting, and weighted voting. A dataset of gathered voice sounds will be used to test the proposed methods. There are 195 biological sounds in the sample, including 147 phonetics for PD patients and 48 for healthy people. The analysis found that an ensemble strategy utilizing decision tree classifiers, MLP, SVM, and the majority voting technique yielded superior results. Specifically, with an accuracy rate of 96.3%, the ensemble approach fared better than the individual classifiers.","","979-8-3315-1859-2","10.1109/DELCON64804.2024.10866439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10866439","Parkinson's disease;machine learning;disease prediction;neurodegenerative disorder;adaboost;bagging;majority voting;soft voting;ensembled","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Biological system modeling;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Robustness;Physiology;Ensemble learning","","","","27","IEEE","11 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So we explored the signal complexity of 21 normal controls (NCs), 26 PPD patients, and 47 PD patients in four frequency bands based on fuzzy entropy (FE). In slow 3 and slow 2 frequency bands, the complexity of patients with PD is higher than that of the PPD patients and NCs. The complexity of the NCs was higher than that of PPD patients. Significant complexity anomalies were found in the caudate, superior frontal gyrus, thalamus, precuneus, and precentral gyrus. There are significant correlations between complexity and regional homogeneity (ReHo), the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), gray matter density/volume (GMD/V), and clinical scores. Results showed that patients had abnormal complexity, and abnormal complexity is related to the frequency band.

However, the associated side effects and high surgical costs pose challenges for some individuals. In this study, a lightweight constant current electrical stimulator was developed, which is driven by the FPGA to control the underlying logic and has multiple programmable stimulation parameters. Clinical experiments involving patients with Parkinson’s-related resting tremor symptoms were conducted to assess the efficacy of peripheral electrical stimulation. Two Co-contraction Avoidance Stimulation (CAS) strategies targeting nerves and muscles were proposed to reduce tremors. Four Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients were recruited to verify the effectiveness of these strategies. Kinematic data recorded by inertial sensors showed that the radial nerve and muscle intervention strategies reduced the average angular velocity amplitude of finger joints during resting tremor by 75.92% and 82.41%, respectively. Notably, under low-frequency pulse stimulation (100 Hz) focused on muscle interference, a low-intensity current of no more than 8 mA maintained a tremor suppression rate of 59.91% even 5 minutes post-stimulation. Based on the experimental results, it is concluded that the constant current electrical stimulator developed in this study can effectively suppress tremor under specific stimulation strategies. These findings have significant implications for the development of lightweight, wearable tremor suppression devices. The stimulator’s adaptability, coupled with its precise control parameters, demonstrates promise for advancing non-invasive and cost-effective tremor management in Parkinson’s patients.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3435749","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91948302); Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT)Wuhu Robot Technology Research Institute(grant numbers:HIT-CXY-CMP2-RVJDT-21-01); Self-Planned Task of State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, HIT(grant numbers:SKLRS202112B,SKLRS-2022-ZM-02); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51521003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10614629","Parkinson’s disease;tremor suppression;peripheral electrical stimulation;FPGA;constant current stimulator","Muscles;Electrical stimulation;Electrodes;Field programmable gate arrays;Robots;Skin;Parkinson's disease","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Tremor;Male;Middle Aged;Female;Aged;Biomechanical Phenomena;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Muscle, Skeletal;Equipment Design;Muscle Contraction;Fingers;Algorithms","1","","35","CCBY","30 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we propose a method for monitoring PwP by stochastically modeling the relationships between wrist movements during unscripted daily activities and corresponding annotations about clinical displays of movement abnormalities. We approach the estimation of PD motor signs by independently modeling and hierarchically stacking Gaussian process models for three classes of commonly observed movement abnormalities in PwP including tremor, (non-tremulous) bradykinesia, and (non-tremulous) dyskinesia. We use clinically adopted severity measures as annotations for training the models, thus allowing our multi-layer Gaussian process prediction models to estimate not only their presence but also their severities. The experimental validation of our approach demonstrates strong agreement of the model predictions with these PD annotations. Our results show that the proposed method produces promising results in objective monitoring of movement abnormalities of PD in the presence of arbitrary and unknown voluntary motions, and makes an important step toward continuous monitoring of PD in the home environment.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2019.2900002","Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:FP7/2007-2013); ERC(grant numbers:337654); Deutsche Stiftung Neurologie and the Deutsche Parkinson Vereinigung; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario's Early Researcher Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8643421","Ambient intelligence;Gaussian processes;medical information system;wearable sensors","Monitoring;Machine learning;Gaussian processes;Estimation;Predictive models;Diseases;Biological system modeling","Accelerometry;Aged;Female;Humans;Hypokinesia;Machine Learning;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Movement;Normal Distribution;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Tremor;Wearable Electronic Devices;Wrist","14","","43","IEEE","17 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For each movement signal, 11 movement parameters have been calculated based on the signal extremum points. Statistically, significant differences between groups for each parameter have been determined using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The most significant differences between the groups have been obtained among the following movement parameters: number of movements, average movements speed, average frequency of movements, and standard deviation of frequency. Differences vary depending on the movement exercise. For all the 3 exercises, Parkinson's disease patients show decrease in the speed of exercise, decrease in the frequency of movements and, as a consequence, decrease in the number of movements.","2376-6565","978-1-6654-0476-1","10.1109/ElConRus51938.2021.9396578","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9396578","Leap Motion;Parkinson Disease;hand movement;kinematic parameters;UPDRS","Conferences;Dynamics;Kinematics;Motion detection;Standards;Diseases","","1","","10","IEEE","9 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detecting Parkinson’s disease involves analyzing the patient’s medical background and conducting multiple imaging tests like MRI, Computed Tomography, and DaTscan, along with physical and neurological assessments. All these steps are essential to validate a definitive diagnosis. Recent researches have proved that speech variations in speech can be considered as a quantifiable indicator to detect Parkinson’s disease in its early stages.This method is both non-invasive and economically efficient in contrast to alternative diagnostic procedures. To achieve a speech-based diagnosis system, we have tried a feature selection algorithm in combination with classification algorithms and a stacking classifier to combine these base models. In the process of feature selection, we have applied the mutual information gain method in combination with three classifiers: K-nearest neighbors(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost. To evaluate various permutations, we’ve made use of the speech dataset provided UCI. To address the issue of imbalanced data, we’ve applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). The stacking classifier has shown the best performance, attaining an accuracy rate of 97.05%.","","979-8-3503-5981-7","10.1109/ICAST59062.2023.10455006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10455006","Parkinson’s Diseases;Vocal features;SVM;KNN;XGBoost;Stacking classifier;SMOTE","Support vector machines;Biological system modeling;Stacking;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Rigidity;Diseases","","","","14","IEEE","4 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The condition is characterized by tremors, vocal cord issues, bradykinesia and slurred, slow speech. It holds the position at the second most predominant neurological problem. Around 6.3 million individuals overall are impacted by this Disease. It is brought about by the passing of dopamine-delivering neurons and basically influences those beyond 60 years old. Moreover, it causes voice weakening in approximately 90% of its patients. Effective treatment and management of PD depend on an early and precise diagnosis. There is a method for early PD detection that uses voice analysis. In the presented research, a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression, are employed to extricate between individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and healthy based on features extracted from voice signals. The prediction of Parkinson’s disease has enormous promise for enhancing patient care and early detection. As data continues to be gathered and models are refined, the accuracy and reliability of PD prediction are expected to improve significantly. The experiment results reveal that the accuracy reached a rate of more than 98% as the highest value when the SVM algorithm is applied.","","979-8-3503-8681-3","10.1109/ICITIIT61487.2024.10580440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10580440","Logistic Regression;Parkinson’s disease;Support Vector Machine (SVM);Decision Tree (DT);Linear Regression;Random Forest (RF)","Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Machine learning algorithms;Accuracy;Writing;Feature extraction;Vectors","","","","20","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a novel approach to Parkinsonts disease diagnosis using vocal features and advanced neural network architectures. In this study, a structure based on dual cross-attention is introduced that combines features extracted from time-frequency representations, specifically the Wavelet Transform (WT) and Tunable Q factor Wavelet Transforms (TQWT), describing both temporal and frequency features of the audio signal simultaneously.

Scientists have long theorized that voice impairment is one of the initial signs of Parkinson's disease. Vocal changes in Parkinson's disease patients could be recognized, enabling earlier intervention before physically incapacitating symptoms manifest. With the use of a number of speeches signaling techniques, the proposed work intends to develop a model that examines a person's voice and forecasts their likelihood of developing an illness. Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder where a part of your brain gradually deteriorates, leading to ever-worse symptoms. Numerous symptoms, including stiffness, bradykinesia, difficulties with coordination, and voice irregularities, are brought on by this neurodegeneration. Dysarthria is another symptom of Parkinson's disease. The primary flaws of PD speaking are decrease in intensity, monotony of pitch and loudness, inappropriate silences, and a breathy voice. Clinical signs, such as the description of a variety of movement symptoms and medical observations, are frequently used for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). On the other hand, conventional diagnostic techniques may be subjectivity-prone since they rely on the interpretation of motions that may be challenging to identify because they are occasionally imperceptible to human sight.","2642-6595","979-8-3503-0544-9","10.1109/ICAECC59324.2023.10560322","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10560322","Related Post-Diagnostic Entropy (RPDE);Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA);Pitch Period Entropy (PPE)","Personal protective equipment;Neurological diseases;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Entropy","","1","","16","IEEE","27 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although Parkinson's disease primarily affects elderly people, but adults can also be affected by this disease. The symptoms are caused by the gradual nerve cell loss in the area of the brain that regulates movement. Patients' quality of life is greatly reduced because it shows motor, cognitive, and other sorts of symptoms. Parkinson's disease is usually diagnosed based on a patient's medical history and physical symptoms. However, it has a subjective nature and a poor prognosis. In the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results. Yet because of the small sample size, poor validation and lack of big data design, it introduces bias. This paper outlines the state-of-the-art methods that have been used to detect Parkinson's disease. The findings of the literature, as well as frequent methodological flaws that may skew results, are identified.

Lifelong medication requires personalized treatment plans developed by physicians, but such approaches are constrained by high costs and limited physician capacity. Although deep learning (DL) methods have been explored, they lack interpretability and are restricted to numerical data inputs. In this study, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to design personalized PD treatment strategies, integrating both patient information in natural language form and external textual knowledge sources (e.g., medical guidelines). To enhance effectiveness, we use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine strategies and establish a robust medication recommendation dataset. To enhance reliability and interpretability, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning within the LLM system, ensuring that each proposed strategy is accompanied by step-by-step explanations and references to similar historical cases. Experimental evaluations using the Parkinson's Progression Marking Initiative (PPMI) dataset show that our method surpasses physician-prescribed treatments, achieving an average reduction of over 1.4 points in the revised unified Parkinson's disease rating scale part III (MDS-UPDRS-III) scores. Our method also outperforms the RL-method by 1.01 points on average. Furthermore, over 43% of patients achieve more than 2 point-reduction of MDS-UPDRS-III scores. A detailed case study highlights the flexibility of LLMs in dynamically adjusting medication plans for patients at different disease stages, highlighting its potential to advance personalized PD management in real-world settings.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2025.3594014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11106675","Parkinson's Disease;LLM;treatment strategies;personalized prescription","Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Medical services;Reliability;Cognition;Large language models;Decision making;Numerical models;Natural languages;Guidelines","","","","","IEEE","1 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Its diagnosis is mostly based on symptom analysis, and it impairs mobility, coordination, and muscular control. Tremors, stiffness, delayed movement, and trouble walking are common signs of the condition, as stated by doctors. Furthermore, alterations in voice are highly prevalent in PD patients, however Some tweaks are not immediately detectable at a preliminary phase. The condition would alter our respiration, tone of voice, and loudness by up to ten decibels. Several research have demonstrated that one of the first signs of PD is changes in speech, hence a Parkinson dataset containing biomedical human voice is employed. As a result, speech recognition has the potential to bring a novel approach to the evaluation and treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The goal of this review is to give comparative research on the methodologies created using machine learning techniques in Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. Machine Learning algorithms are being used to treat Parkinson’s disease. A data collection of speech characteristics is used to determine whether and someone is in good health. If impacted, the harshness may be determined and likely treated accordingly. Models such as Random Forest classification, K Nearest Neighbour, XGBoost and Support Vector Machine are used in the suggested study. Principal component analysis is also used to minimize the amount of characteristics (PCA). These models’ performance is assessed and contrasted. Using the PD dataset, these models achieve an accuracy of 70% to 91%. Superior performance models are being explored for ensembles as well as to improve overall performance standards. The ensemble of models is employed to achieve the greatest accuracy of 91% and exact disease detection.","","979-8-3503-9781-9","10.1109/TEMSMET56707.2023.10149929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10149929","PD;Diagnosis;Symptoms;Machine Learning;Algorithms","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Speech recognition;Medical diagnosis;Ensemble learning;Standards;Random forests","","9","","13","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A servo-motor robotic arm was developed to rhythmically flex and extend the subjects arm and their response was measured using continuous electromyography (EMG) sampled at 4kHz. Surface electrodes were attached over the biceps of the more severely affected arm and a reference electrode attached to the back of the contra-lateral hand. EMG data was normalized using the rest mean EMG level and then segmented into epochs according to the position data. EMG recorded from normal subjects remained flat throughout the trial with only very small fluctuations in amplitude about the mean. In contrast, biceps activity in parkinsonian patients tended to increase with flexion and as expected there were large variations in amplitude about the baseline activity. A fast fourier transform was also performed and spectra obtained from a typical Parkinsonian patient showed two peaks at approximately 6 Hz and 8 Hz, consistent with previously published data. In conclusion, the results clearly differentiate between normal and parkinsonian cases and to some extent severity.

Though much work has been done investigating ways to infer brain connectivity networks, the temporal dynamics of brain coupling has been less well studied. Assuming that brain connections are purely static or purely dynamic is assuredly unrealistic, as the brain must strike a balance between stability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose making joint inference of time-invariant connections as well as time-varying coupling patterns by employing a multitask learning model followed by a least-squares approach to accurately estimate the connectivity coefficients. We applied this method to resting state fMRI data from PD and control subjects and estimated the eigenconnectivity networks to obtain the representative patterns of both static and dynamic brain connectivity features.

Different from conventional approaches where only two datasets are considered and the interest is to interpret one dataset by another in a unidirectional fashion, the goal in this paper is to model three data spaces simultaneously in a tridirectional fashion. To address the intersubject variability concern in real-world medical applications, we further propose a group analysis framework based on the proposed method and apply it to concurrent EEG, EMG and behavior signals collected from 8 normal subjects and 9 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) performing a dynamic motor task. The results demonstrate highly correlated temporal patterns among the three types of signals and meaningful spatial activation patterns.

Doctors can typically diagnose it by looking at movement problems and a patient's medical history. However, these traditional methods rely on interpreting subtle movements, which can be subjective and prone to error. This paper explores the application of deep learning for improved Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This work proposes a novel method employing pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - ResNet50 and VGG16 - alongside image resizing and Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) optimization. The models were trained and evaluated on an MRI dataset encompassing PD patients and healthy controls. The proposed method achieved outstanding accuracy in classifying Parkinson's disease. Notably, ResNet50 achieved 95.06% accuracy, while VGG16 reached an impressive 96.30% in correctly identifying PD compared to healthy participants. Additionally, the performance measures such as sensitivity, specificity and precision are assessed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. This research demonstrates that deep learning techniques can effectively analyze MRI scans to detect Parkinson's disease. However, further studies are warranted to validate these findings on larger datasets and assess the model's generalizability for clinical use.","","979-8-3315-3074-7","10.1109/MECON62796.2024.10776072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10776072","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);ResNet50;VGG16;Image analysis;Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM);Accuracy;Sensitivity;Specificity","Deep learning;Accuracy;Sensitivity;Parkinson's disease;Magnetic resonance imaging;Stochastic processes;Particle measurements;Convolutional neural networks;Optimization;Residual neural networks","","","","11","IEEE","10 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model extends previous models to incorporate cortical inputs to the subthalamic nucleus through the `hyperdirect' pathway, changes in coupling between STN neurons due to dopamine depletion and the plateau potential generating capacity of STN neurons. The effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) across a range of frequencies on the oscillatory activity is examined. High frequency DBS attenuates synchronous oscillatory activity within the STN-GPe network at both the tremor and beta frequencies.

Parkinsonism is assessed during clinical evaluations and via self-administered diaries and, based on these, the required medication therapies are provided to lessen symptoms. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes have the potential utility to objectively assess the patient’s condition and aid clinicians in their decision-making. People with Parkinson’s often have significant abnormalities in blood pressure due to comorbid age-related cardiovascular disease and orthostatic hypotension, which result in blurred vision, dizziness, and falls. Frequent blood pressure monitoring may aid in the evaluation of such events and differentiate Parkinson’s disease symptoms from those originated by hypotension. In the present paper, a novel technology for the remote monitoring of Parkinsonian symptoms is presented: the WESAA system. It consists of two devices, worn on the wrist and ankle; its main function is to record accelerations and angular velocities from these body parts, together with photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram data. This information can be elaborated offline to measure common Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia), as well as gait speed, sleep-wake cycles, and cuff-less blood pressure measurements. The overall system requirements, market overview, industrial design and ergonomics, system development, user experience, early results of the gathered inertial raw data, and validation of the photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram signal waveforms are all thoroughly discussed.

Online handwriting analysis is one of the methods that can be used to diagnose PD. The purpose of this study is to find a subset of handwriting features suitable for efficiently identifying subjects with PD. Data was taken from PDMultiMC database collected in Lebanon, and consisting of 16 medicated PD patients and 16 age matched controls. Seven handwriting tasks were collected such as copying patterns, copying words in Arabic, and writing full names. For each task kinematic and spatio-temporal, pressure, energy, entropy, and intrinsic features were extracted. Feature selection was done in two stages; the first stage selected a subset using statistical analysis, and the second step selected the most relevant features of this subset by a suboptimal approach. The selected features were fed to a support vector machine classifier with RBF kernel, whose aim is to identify the subjects suffering from PD. The accuracy of the classification of PD was as high as 96.875%, with sensitivity and specificity equal to 93.75 % and 100% respectively. The results as well as the selected features suggest that handwriting can be a valuable marker as a PD diagnosis tool.","","978-1-5090-6628-5","10.1109/ASAR.2017.8067759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067759","PDMultiMC database;Parkinson's disease (PD);SVM;radial basis function kernel (RBF kernel);handwriting","Feature extraction;Databases;Entropy;Parkinson's disease;Support vector machines;Kernel","","33","","23","IEEE","16 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This limits the extent of benefit that may be derived from the treatment as disease/patient characteristics are generally non-stationary. Wearable sensors that provide continuous monitoring of various symptoms, such as bradykinesia and dyskinesia, can enhance symptom management. However, using such data to overhaul the current static medication treatment planning approach and prescribe personalized medication timing and dosage that accounts for patient/care-giver/physician feedback/preferences remains an open question. We develop a model to prescribe timing and dosage of medications, given the motor fluctuation data collected using wearable sensors in real-time. We solve the resulting model using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The prescribed policy determines the optimal treatment plan that minimizes patient's symptoms. Our results show that the model-prescribed policy outperforms the static a priori treatment plan in improving patients' symptoms, providing a proof-of-concept that DRL can augment medical decision making for treatment planning of chronic disease patients.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175311","","Timing;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Planning;Medical services;Biomedical monitoring;Time series analysis","Clinical Decision-Making;Dyskinesias;Humans;Levodopa;Parkinson Disease","12","","19","IEEE","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In BLS, the original input features are mapped to several new feature representations to form the feature nodes, and then these mapped features are expanded to enhancement nodes by random mapping in a wide sense. However, random mapping performed for enhancement nodes is too simple and the generated features lack interpretability together with relative low representation. In this work, we propose a multiple empirical kernel mapping (MEKM) based BLS (MEKM-BLS) algorithm, which adopts MEKM to map the data of feature nodes to enhancement nodes.

PD patients mainly suffer from motor symptoms, which significantly impact their daily lives. The diagnostic criteria for PD include the presence of muscle rigidity, tremor, and postural reflex disturbances. The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is the standard tool for evaluating PD symptoms, part III of which is dedicated to motor symptoms. That part involves a comprehensive set of specific physical examinations, and physicians assign semi quantitative scores from 0 to 4. However, this approach faces notable challenges, including the requirement for movement-disorder experts proficient in using MDS-UPDRS and the presence of substantial inter rater variability even among experts. Overcoming these challenges requires a quantitative and objective assessment method. Given that the rating of motor symptoms predominantly involves assessing kinematic characteristics, the integration of sensor-based devices and machine learning techniques holds the potential to outperform human experts in symptom evaluations. This study used the Leap Motion optical motion-capture device to quantitatively measure and analyze hand movements while 45 PD patients performed the following 3 tasks from the MDS-UPDRS part III: finger tapping (FT), hand opening and closing (OC), and forearm pronation and supination (PS). Data from these tasks were collected and processed, resulting in the extraction of 31 movement patterns for each task. Additionally, 69 statistical features were extracted from each movement pattern, yielding 2139 features for each task. We subsequently employed a random forest algorithm to select the top 15% of features based on the reduction of Gini impurity. These selected features were subsequently fed into a sequential-forward-floating-selection algorithm, combined with a support vector machine, to identify relevant feature combinations and predict the severity of the motor symptoms. The classification accuracy was 87.0% for FT, 93.2% for OC, and 92.2% for PS. One-way analysis of variance identified 13 features of the OC task that were significantly more discriminative for classifying the movement disability of PD patients ( ${p}$ <0.05).

Their efficacy extends to the diagnosis of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s Disease (PD), which is typically identified through Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) scans. However, relying solely on visual inspection of SPECT images during medical examinations can introduce inaccuracies due to subjective factors. We propose a CAD system for automatic PD diagnosis using pre-trained CNN models, Transfer Learning (TL) technique, and the Bilinear Pooling method to address this issue. The study employs several CNN architectures, specifically Efficient-Net B0, and Mobile-Net V2 models, and a custom CNN architecture. These pre-trained architectures were originally trained on ImageNet and adapted to the current task using the TL technique. These architectures are leveraged with a bilinear pooling form, resulting in three Bilinear CNN (BCNN) models. These models are applied to pre-processed SPECT image data of PD patients and Healthy Controls (HC), categorized into three distinct datasets. The proposed method is evaluated on a total of 2720 SPECT images (1360 PD and 1360 HC subjects) obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The findings show that the BCNN EfficientNet-B0-MobileNet-V2 model achieved the highest accuracy score of 98.47%, surpassing other developed CNN models and outperforming existing methods. In conclusion, the proposed CAD system provides an efficient diagnostic tool to assist physicians in making accurate PD diagnoses, independent of subjective factors.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3308075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227277","Bilinear pooling;convolutional neural networks;deep learning;Parkinson’s disease;SPECT","Single photon emission computed tomography;Solid modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Computational modeling;Medical diagnostic imaging;Data models;Parkinson's disease;Deep learning","","10","","21","CCBYNCND","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper focuses on the problem of early PD identification through handwriting and drawing tasks, and by using three well-known PD data-sets. Given the scarcity of handwriting samples and the wide spectrum of Parkinson’s disease symptoms, the challenge is known to be particularly difficult. To achieve reliable PD detection, we employ diverse data augmentation techniques to expand the dataset size. Then, we deploy and train the different architectures of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) each of which extract different salient features and aspect of input data due to its unique layout and structure (i.e., number of layers, kernels, normalization, number of connected layers, etc.). After experimental analysis of the performance of individual CNNs, we selected the promising feature vectors and employed different early fusion strategies before final classification. This is a very useful technique that allows a classification model to learn and detect from various representations of data provided by multiple CNNs and improve the overall system performance. Experimental results show that the fusion of freeze features of multiple deep CNN models significantly achieves better exactness of 99.35% in comparison to uni model CNN and other state-of-the-art work.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3337804","Center for Equitable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Systems (CEAMLS) at Morgan State University(grant numbers:#11202202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335677","Parkinson’s disease;CNN;ensemble learning;features fusion;SVM","Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Support vector machines;Task analysis;Neurons;Data mining;Single photon emission computed tomography;Parkinson's disease;Ensemble learning","","9","","44","CCBYNCND","30 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, less research has been done concerning postural tremor and action tremor detection, which are difficult to classify only using frequency-domain features.

Parkinson’s disease is one of them, usually having a confirmed diagnosis when it is already very developed. Some physicians have proposed using electroencephalograms as a non-invasive method for a prompt diagnosis. The problem with these tests is that data analysis relies on the clinical eye of a very experienced professional, which entails situations that escape human perception. This research proposes the use of deep learning techniques in combination with electroencephalograms to develop a non-invasive method for Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. These models have demonstrated their good performance in managing massive amounts of data. Our main contribution is to apply models from the field of Natural Language Processing, particularly an adaptation of BERT models, for being the last milestone in the area. This model choice is due to the similarity between texts and electroencephalograms that can be processed as data sequences.

Vision abnormalities contribute to the non-motor PD deficits, yet little research has studied how PD affects visual perceptions with no produced motor responses. This provides motivation for the current study which focuses on examining allocentric visual displacement perception - information used for object identification - in PD patients. To study this PD participants OFF and ON Levodopa therapy, and age-matched healthy control participants were tested. A modular graphics toolbox was implemented to carry out the perceptual testing. Individuals with PD were shown to have impairments in displacement perception of the larger tested magnitudes when both OFF and ON Levodopa compared to control participants, suggesting impairments in visual displacement processing pathways. These abnormalities could contribute to difficulties some PD patients have with visual recognition and visuospatial navigation. Furthermore, the study validated the graphical tool as a means of quantifying perceptual abilities that can be expanded to many perceptual modalities and paired with robotic devices.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512754","","Visualization;Standards;PD control;Green products;Tools;Diseases;Visual perception","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Case-Control Studies;Computers;Humans;Levodopa;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Vision Disorders;Vision Tests;Vision, Ocular;Visual Perception","3","","27","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transcranial sonography (TCS) has become a popular imaging tool for diagnosis of PD in clinical practice. Moreover, several pioneering work have developed the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for PD with the transcranial B-mode sonography (TBS). It is worth noting that TCS not only has the TBS modality, but also can image the blood flow of major cerebral arteries, which is named transcranial Doppler sonography (TDS). TDS also has been applied to evaluate PD patients with orthostatic hypotension. However, the TDS-based CAD for PD has not been investigated. Since TBS and TDS provide the complementary structural and functional information about brain, it is feasible to develop a multi-modal TCS-based CAD for PD by combining both TBS and TDS. Therefore, in this work, we propose a multiple kernel learning (MKL) based CAD for PD with multi-modal TCS imaging. Particularly, the statistical and texture features are extracted from the midbrain region from TBS images, and the features about blood flow are calculated from the spectrum curves in TDS. The multi-modal features are then fed to a MKL classifier for classification of PD. The experimental results show that the multi-modal TCS-based method outperforms both the single-modal TBS- and TDS-based algorithm, which suggests the feasibility and effectiveness of combining TBS and TDS for diagnosis of PD.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512194","","Feature extraction;Kernel;Support vector machines;Classification algorithms;Diseases;Imaging;Blood flow","Aged;Brain;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Humans;Male;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Parkinson Disease;Ultrasonography;Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial","3","","15","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quantifying this behavior using the time-scale multi-resolution analysis provides valuable information to the prediction of fall risk in Parkinson's disease patients. In this paper, multifractal spectrum measures, as complexity or smoothness measures of signal, were used to classify faller Parkinson's disease patients from the non-fallers. From data previously gathered, in 11 faller PD participants and 49 non-fallers, the center of pressure signal was recorded on a rigid and foam surface with open and closed eyes. Multifractal spectrum (MFS) measures were calculated using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Based on MFS measures, several classification algorithms including decision trees, naive Bayes, logistic regression, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) were tested searching for the best one. With the aim of better classification performance, stratified cross-validation, as a sample balancing method, and ensemble methods such as Bagging and Adaboost were applied. Results showed the most prevalent smooth behavior in MFS ($a_{0}$) on the rigid surface can separate the faller PD participants effectively. Additionally, proprioception (standing on foam or rigid surface), as compared to vision, had a more important role in signal smoothness. A decision tree based on the ID3 algorithm with Bagging showed an acceptable performance (accuracy=0.88, sensitivity=0.57, precision=0.75). Multifractal spectrum analysis of COP disclosed the postural instability characteristics in faller PD patients, that dispose patients to fall, and which is discriminable by fine-tuned classifiers.","","978-1-6654-9984-2","10.1109/ICBME54433.2021.9750367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750367","Parkinson's disease;Center Of Pressure;Faller and Non-Faller;Multifractal Spectrum;Decision Tree;Stratified cross-validation","Support vector machines;Atmospheric measurements;Parkinson's disease;Artificial neural networks;Biomedical measurement;Particle measurements;Fractals","","1","","31","IEEE","13 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most patients do not get full therapeutic benefit from DBS, due to its critical dependence on electrode location in the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN). For this reason, we believe that the development of a novel surgical tool for DBS placement, i.e., an automated intraoperative closed-loop DBS localization system, is essential. In this paper, we analyze single unit spiking activity of 120 neurons in different STN locations collected from 4 PD patients. Specifically, for each neuron, we estimate a point process model (PPM) of the spiking activity for different depths within the STN by which we are able to detect pathological bursting and oscillations. Our results suggest that these signatures are more prominent in the dorsolateral part of the STN. Therefore, accurately placing the DBS electrode in this target may result in maximal therapeutic benefit with less power effort required by DBS. Furthermore, PPMs might be an effective tool for modeling of the STN neuronal activities as a function of location within the STN, which may pave the way towards developing a closed-loop navigation tool for optimal DBS electrode placement.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346481","","Neurons;Oscillators;Satellite broadcasting;Computational modeling;History;Analytical models;Electrodes","Algorithms;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electrophysiology;Humans;Parkinson Disease;Subthalamic Nucleus","1","","25","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The novel device is equipped with an electrical motor to move the wrist joint in a flexion-extension manner with different velocity profiles. The accuracy of the device was measured in terms of position, velocity and torque accuracy. The feasibility of the measurement procedure was tested in a pilot study with four PD patients and 12 healthy controls (HC), at velocities of 10°/s, 50°/s, and 100°/s. The position and velocity of the developed device were (0.005 ± 0.105)° and (0.734 ± 0.276)°/s, unloaded, and (0.003 ± 0.113)° and (0.013 ± 0.038)°/s, loaded with a relaxed arm, respectively. The torque accuracy was (15.029 ± 2.235) mNm. The comparison of the median rigidity between the PD patients and HC showed significant differences at all tested velocities, during both flexion and extension movements.

Feature extraction and preprocessing further enhance interpretability and performance. Compared to individual models, the ensemble approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Brain imaging aids differential diagnosis in Parkinsonism, but no Cerebral imaging methods is currently recommended for routine clinical practice despite their proven utility. Larger trial are needed to validate the medical value and long-standing cost-effectiveness of Cerebral imaging for managing patients within healthcare systems like the NHS.","","979-8-3315-0845-6","10.1109/ICICACS65178.2025.10969050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10969050","parkinson's disease (PD);ensemble learning;brain scans;MRI;PET;single-photon imaging","Neuroimaging;Support vector machines;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Imaging;Sensitivity and specificity;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Ensemble learning;Resilience","","","","23","IEEE","24 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increased global aging has focused more research on early recognition and evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD). Hand movement disorders are a major motor disorder frequently employed in the clinical assessment of PD, resulting in abnormal writing performance in the majority of individuals with Parkinson's disease. Evaluating and recognizing the quality of hand movements is pivotal in the early diagnosis of PD. In this research, we design a coordinate enhanced local and global attention network (CoorLGNet) for handwriting recognition in PD patients and healthy individuals. Based on CNN and Transformer, the proposed network extracts multi-scale features of handwriting through a hierarchical structure, which can assess its potential in identifying PD. The presented model undergoes training and assessment using two openly accessible handwriting datasets. Compared to several cutting-edge approaches, our model obtains competitive classification results with accuracies of 94.94% and 93.58%, respectively.","","979-8-3503-0656-9","10.1109/CIoTSC60428.2023.00018","National Natural Science Foundation of China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10695485","Parkinson's disease;Handwriting recognition;CNN;Transformer","Training;Handwriting recognition;Parkinson's disease;Target recognition;Smart cities;Writing;Feature extraction;Transformers;Motors;Videos","","","","30","IEEE","7 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain is the disease's primary cause, resulting in progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. But the existing methods have lot of disadvantages such as over fitting, quality control and limited data availability. To overcome the aforementioned problem, A Spherical Convolutional Neural Network with Mantis Search Algorithm (SCNN-MSA) is proposed for accurately classifying PD.

Following that segmentation are done using Spike-Driven Transformer–based U-Net (SDT-Unet).

In fact, for this reason, an early diagnosis becomes imperative—the appropriate application of intervention treatment often hampers an already conventional type of diagnosis. Thereby, clinical diagnosis remains mostly subjective. Advances in some state-of-the-art computational algorithms open new pathways offering noninvasive scalable solutions toward early detection. These approaches employ manifold modalities, ranging from voice analysis to wearable sensors, and hybrid machine learning frameworks, with diagnosis accuracy going as high as 97% in some cases. The major contributions are: Enhanced Smallest Normalized Difference Associative Memory, advanced nonlinear speech analysis techniques, telemonitoring systems that enable the remote monitoring of symptoms, and hybrid feature selection models such as HEFS-MLDR, which integrates dimensionality reduction with ensemble learning methodologies. While these are promising developments, a number of open challenges remain: dependence on high-quality data, generalizability across diverse populations is limited, and hybrid models are computationally intractable. Recent studies also highlighted that more work is needed to be done on developing better integration of multimodal data, more interpretable AI models, and clinical validation across diverse populations for broad generalizability. On the other hand, notwithstanding the mentioned difficulties, advances in computational methods have underlined the potential of these approaches for further improvement in diagnostic systems toward more accessible, more accurate, and efficient early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.","","979-8-3315-3297-0","10.1109/IRASET64571.2025.11007996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11007996","Parkinson's disease;Early diagnosis;Machine learning frameworks;Noninvasive detection;Voice analysis;Wearable sensors;Hybrid models;Multimodal data integration;Clinical validation","Deep learning;Analytical models;Accuracy;Speech analysis;Parkinson's disease;Reviews;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Data models;Wearable sensors","","","","72","IEEE","26 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then quantified CoP data from each individual using a variety of sway metrics, and explored metrics that have a classification capability equivalent to the MBC.

In this paper, an objective dyskinesia score was developed using an IMU -based motion capture system. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is currently the only acute intervention that results in the rapidly progressive reduction of dyskinesia's severity; hence, this form of therapy was selected as a model to validate the proposed method. Thirteen Parkinson's disease participants undergoing DBS surgery and 12 age-matched healthy control participants were assessed using the motion capture system. Concurrent Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) ratings were also performed. Parkinson's disease participants were assessed pre-operatively and for five visits post-operatively while seated at rest, during arms outstretched and while performing an action task. The kinematic data were used to develop an objective measure defined as the dyskinesia severity score. Generally, a strong correlation was observed between the UDysRS ratings and the full-body dyskinesia severity scores. The results suggest that it is feasible and clinically meaningful to utilize an objective full-body dyskinesia score for the assessment of dyskinesia.

In addition, we show that while the training phase of machine learning process from one country can be reused in the other; different features dominate in each country; presumably because of languages differences. Three results are presented: (i) separate training and testing by each country (close to 85% range); (ii) pooled training and testing (about 80% range) and (iii) cross-country (training in one and testing in the other) (about 75% ranges). We discovered that different feature sets were needed for each country (language).","","978-1-4673-4681-8","10.1109/EEEI.2012.6377065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377065","Parkinson Disease;Early Diagnosis;Classification;Machine Learning;Speech Data;Pattern Matching;SVM","Diseases;Speech;Training;Accuracy;Support vector machines;Machine learning;Acoustics","","50","","13","IEEE","10 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
