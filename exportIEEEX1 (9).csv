However, not much research has been initiated in the areas of alzheimer disease or neurological information systems. The second significant neurological disease that causes people to face severe consequences is Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disease that affects millions of people around the world. Most of the cases are undetected because of a lack of detection techniques. This research adopts a data mining technique to study about the literature on the detection, early stage, and treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The study was conducted by browsing for the literature indexed by Scopus, and the literature includes terms about data-mining and condition of Parkinson’s disease. This research study will focus on how DMT and its applications have been evolving in the case of PD over the last 16 years. In this line, this research categorizes the literature survey and takes up the methods of data mining, their applications, and how they have developed over the years 2004 to 2020. The DMT review will be picked up through the Scopus online database, which yielded 273 papers in 159 scholarly journals about the uses of DMT through the use of word indices and articles abstracts. Another objective that this work seeks is to provide guidance to researchers on the use of data analysis associated with the study of Parkinson’s disease. Data mining recently has emerged as an effective tool in the area of research regarding Parkinson’s disease (PD) offering substantial potential to enhance our knowledge of this complex neurodegenerative disease.","","979-8-3503-6810-9","10.1109/ICICAT62666.2024.10923302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10923302","Data Mining;Parkinson’s Disease;Machine Learning;Diagnosis;Prognosis;Treatment;Neurodegenerative Disorder;Healthcare;Systematic Review","Neurological diseases;Surveys;Costs;Medical services;Data mining;Prognostics and health management;Speech processing;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Systematic literature review","","","","34","IEEE","20 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a matter of sorrow that no specific clinical tests were introduced to detect Parkinson's disease correctly. As Parkinson's disease is non-communicable, early-stage detection of Parkinson's can prevent further damages in humans suffering from it. However, it has been observed that PD's presence in a human is related to its hand-writing as well as hand-drawn subjects. From that perspective, several techniques have been proposed by researchers to detect Parkinson's disease from hand-drawn images of suspected people. But, the previous methods have their constraints. In this investigation, an approach to predict Parkinson's disease from hand-drawn wave and spiral images using computer vision and machine learning techniques has been recommended. Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and some other classification algorithms with the HOG feature descriptor algorithm was applied. The proposed strategy with Gradient Boosting and K-Nearest Neighbors accomplished better execution in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity as well as in system design flexibility.

Despite the potential of wearable sensors in predicting FOG, challenges persist, including the brief prediction interval before FOG onset, limited generalization across patients, and the inconvenience of multiple sensors. Addressing one issue often aggravates others, making it difficult to achieve suitable concurrent solutions to all these challenges. Methods: We introduce the PhysioGait Predictive Network (PhysioGPN), a deep learning framework designed to predict FOG events in PD patients at least 2 seconds prior to onset. The model architecture incorporates four key strategies: 1) Detection of progressive motion changes using large convolutional kernels; 2) Unraveling the complexity of motion coordination and gait dynamics using multi-dimensional and multi-scale convolution; 3) Capture gait self-similarity and asymmetry with twin-tower structure; 4) Promoting cross-domain information exchange with multi-domain attention. Furthermore, we propose a framework based on knowledge distillation (KD), reducing the model's dependence on multiple sensors while maintaining prediction accuracy. Results: The model achieves an 85.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC) in FOG prediction. When reducing the number of sensors, KD mitigates the decline in performance and increases the AUC by 5.1%, compared to scenarios without KD. Conclusion: Our research proposes a practical solution to the challenges of FOG prediction, demonstrating the effectiveness of the KD approach for lightweight wearable sensors in rehabilitation engineering.

Phase plots were constructed in 41 people with PD and 38 controls (CL) from accelerometry data collected during straight intermittent walks with a single triaxial accelerometer placed on the lower back. Phase plots were analysed using bivariate Gaussian mixture models and classified based on several apparent features derived from the parameters of said model. Significant differences in phase plot form were found between and PD and CL subjects; with a very high within-subject consistency (reproducibility) (p < 0.0001). PD and CL subjects differ in the types of phase plots produced (p < 0.001). Strong connections between spatio-temporal (ST) gait characteristics and phase plot types were found. The presented novel methodology not only showed to be sensitive to pathology (PD vs CL), but can quickly produce a unique fingerprint of a person’s gait.

On the other hand, it is still a popular way to adopt only a single neuroimaging modality for PD diagnosis in a clinical practice. In this work, we construct a novel cascaded multi-column RVFL+ (cmcRVFL+) framework for the single-modal neuroimaging-based PD diagnosis without the additional neuroimaging modality as PI. Specifically, the predicted values of RVFL+ classifiers in the current layers are used as the PI for the following classifiers, and therefore, the PI features are self-generated without additional modality. Furthermore, only the multi-column RVFL+ classifiers in the last layer of cmcRVFL+ are finally ensembled to generate the predictive result in the test stage. The experimental results on both the transcranial sonography data set and the magnetic resonance imaging data set for PD show that the proposed cmcRVFL+ algorithm achieves superior performance to all the compared algorithms.

The gait analysis is mostly performed on temporal and spectral feature extraction in which there is a high rate of missing important features. Apart from this, monitoring and quantification of Parkinson's disease patients raise many therapeutic challenges in terms of severity analysis of motor symptoms i.e. freezing of gait (FOG), bradykinesia and continuous remote monitoring of patients. The objective of this study is to use a smart insole dataset for the assessment of computational techniques focusing on gait evaluation. The objective of this research study is to use continuous wavelet transform to convert time series signals into an images instead of using more traditional techniques for dealing with time series based on e.g. recurrent architectures.

One such neuro-degenerative disorder is Parkinson’s Disease (PD). It is categorized by motor symptoms that affect a patient’s motor skills and non-motor symptoms that affect the general health of a PD patient. The quality of life of a patient with PD is highly compromised. To date, there is no cure for the disease, but early intervention and assistive care can help a PD patient to perform daily activities with considerable ease. Many research works in PD management discuss the challenges that healthcare professionals face in the early detection and management of this disease. Sensor devices have been promising to overcome these challenges to a certain degree because of the low cost and accuracy in measurement, yielding precise conclusive results to detect, monitor, and manage PD. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that provides an in-depth analysis of the PD symptoms, Motor and Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS), the current diagnosis and management techniques used and their efficacy. The paper also highlights the work of various researchers in wearable sensors and their proposals to improve the quality of life of a PD patient by diagnosing, monitoring, and managing PD symptoms remotely via wearable sensors. Another area of focus is commercially available wearables for PD management and a few promising works in progress. This paper will be beneficial for future researchers to identify existing gaps and provide the clinicians better insight into the disease progression, and avoid complications. This paper analyzes around 50+ articles from 2016 to 2021 and concludes that there is still much room for improvement in wearables for PD management during the research process. While much work has been attributed to PD Motor Symptom management, there is little focus on the management of PD NMS via wearable sensors. Furthermore, this paper also presents future work for PD management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3162844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9743908","Parkinson’s;wearable sensors;tremors;gait disturbances;sleep dysfunction;remote monitoring;freezing of gait (FoG);depression;cognition;machine learning;early detection","Diseases;Wearable sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Medical diagnostic imaging;Depression;Machine learning;Cognition;Parkinson's disease;Gain measurement;Wearable devices","","85","","111","CCBY","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There has been limited research on investigating upper-limb force control in people with PD with PLR-FOG, and without FOG. In this pilot study, force control was explored using an upper-and-lower-limb haptics-enabled robot in a reaching task while people with PD with and without PLR-FOG were on their levodopa medication. A healthy control group was used for reference, and each cohort completed the task at three different levels of assistance provided by the robot. Similar significant proportional force control deficits were found in the upper and lower limbs in patients with PLR-FOG versus those without FOG. Some aspects of force control were found to be retained, including an ability to increase or decrease force in response to changes in resistance while completing a reaching task.

Since PD is irreversible and its treatment only slows down its rate of development, the early diagnosis by accurate prediction is of great significance to retard its deterioration. However, the existing computer-assisted diagnosis methods for PD have limitations in exploring the implicit and spatial information in the brain. In view of this limitation, a 3D network based on self-supervised learning strategy and attention mechanism is proposed for PD classification in this paper. The proposed method put the input of successive frames from the preprocessed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data into 3D ResNet18 with the classifier module for PD classification. Specifically, the attention mechanism is used to explore the discriminative features. Meanwhile, a self-supervised learning pretext task and a regression task are designed to assist in training and improve the robustness of the proposed model. We use a 5-fold cross-validation strategy to corroborate our method’s effectiveness on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset.

Optimal functioning of SMI is essential for perceiving the environment, modulating the motor outputs, and learning or modifying motor skills to suit the demands of the environment. Growing evidence suggests that patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) may suffer from an impairment in SMI that contributes to perceptual deficits, leading to motor abnormalities. However, the exact nature of the SMI impairment is still unclear. This study uses a robot-assisted assessment tool to quantitatively characterize SMI impairments in PD patients and how they affect voluntary movements. A set of assessment tasks was developed using a robotic manipulandum equipped with a virtual-reality system. The sensory conditions of the virtual environment were varied to facilitate the assessment of SMI. A hundred PD patients (before and after medication) and forty-three control subjects completed the tasks under varying sensory conditions. The kinematic measures obtained from the robotic device were used to evaluate SMI. The findings reveal that across all sensory conditions, PD patients had 36% higher endpoint error, 38% higher direction error in reaching tasks, and 43% higher number of violations in tracing tasks than control subjects due to impairment in integrating sensory inputs. However, they still retained motor learning ability and the ability to modulate motor outputs. The medication worsened the SMI deficits as PD patients, after medication, performed worse than before medication when encountering dynamic sensory environments and exhibited impaired motor learning ability.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3299884","Mitacs Accelerate Program(grant numbers:R2881A07); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN-1345); Tier-1 Canada Research Chairs Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196468","Sensorimotor integration;Parkinson’s disease;KINARM endpoint robot","Robot sensing systems;Task analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Feature extraction;Visualization;Parkinson's disease;Testing","Parkinson Disease;Humans;Male;Female;Middle Aged;Robotics;Machine Learning;Task Performance and Analysis","5","","36","CCBY","28 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This framework integrates fMRI connectivity features into deep embedded clustering (DEC), a deep neural network based on a stacked autoencoder. Compared to three prevalent clustering methods and their combinations with principal component analysis (PCA), the DECBP exhibited a significantly higher similarity between scans, individuals, and groups, indicating enhanced reproducibility. The generated reliable parcellations were also largely consistent with other public atlases. We further explored the functional subunits in the striatum in a data set from 23 Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects and 27 age-matched healthy controls (HC). All putaminal subregions of PD demonstrated lower interhemispheric connectivity than those of HC, which might reflect imbalance in the pathological progression of PD. Such hypo-connectivity was also observed between putaminal subregions and other brain regions, reflecting neuroimaging manifestations of the altered cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit. These observed weaker couplings were associated with PD severity and duration. Our results support the utilization of the DECBP framework and suggest that abnormal connectivity in putaminal subregions may be a potential indicator of PD.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3083879","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61922075); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC1312001,2017YFC0840105); USTC Research Funds of the Double First-Class Initiative(grant numbers:YD2100002004); Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2019-025); John Nichol Chair in Parkinson's Research (MJM); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9442339","Resting-state fMRI;deep neural network;deep embedded connectivity-based parcellation;parkinson's disease","Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Diseases;Head;Correlation;Clustering methods;Bioinformatics;Reliability","Brain Mapping;Cluster Analysis;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Pathways;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results","10","","54","IEEE","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study investigates the application of general human motion encoders trained on large-scale human motion datasets for analyzing gait patterns in PD patients. Although these models have learned a wealth of human biomechanical knowledge, their effectiveness in analyzing pathological movements, such as parkinsonian gait, has yet to be fully validated. We propose a comparative framework and evaluate six pre-trained state-of-the-art human motion encoder models on their ability to predict the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) gait scores from motion capture data. We compare these against a traditional gait feature-based predictive model in a recently released large public PD dataset, including PD patients on and off medication. The feature-based model currently shows higher weighted average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Motion encoder models with closely comparable results demonstrate promise for scalability and efficiency in clinical settings. This potential is underscored by the enhanced performance of the encoder model upon fine-tuning on PD training set. Four of the six human motion models examined provided prediction scores that were significantly different between on- and off-medication states. This finding reveals the sensitivity of motion encoder models to nuanced clinical changes, emphasizing their potential utility in clinical settings. It also underscores the necessity for continued customization of these models to better capture disease-specific features, thereby reducing the reliance on labor-intensive feature engineering. Lastly, we establish a benchmark for the analysis of skeleton-based motion encoder models in clinical settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide a benchmark that enables state-of-the-art models to be tested and compete in a clinical context.

Compared to the conventional clinical TD/PIGD phenotypes, our subtyping was highly stable in 5 years’ visits. The two subtypes of PD showed significant differences in motor symptoms, medication effects, CSF biomarkers, and longitudinal progression. Moreover, patients of subtype 2 showed widespread lower cortical-to-dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) connections and higher medication effects on motor symptoms which was regulated by 5-HT neurons in DRN. Our results suggest distinct neuropathological pathways underlying the two subtypes, such that, in contrast to the typical PD subtype, patients of subtype 2 may be affected by serotonergic modulation on dopaminergic neurons in striatum.

A patient has to be diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) as soon as feasible to receive appropriate management and intervention. This is because early diagnosis opens up treatment choices that can significantly improve patient’s quality of life. To develop advanced diagnostic models for Parkinson’s disease, there has been a notable rise in research at the intersection of computer science and medicine. Preprocessing data, choosing pertinent features, and training models-such as Decision Trees, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and other boosting algorithms-are all part of the research. To diagnose Parkinson’s disease, the comparison analysis evaluates model performance indicators and emphasizes interpretability using LIME and SHAP approaches.

Also they are asked to perform `Dual task' while walking, to have a better understanding of the connection between central nervous system and the limb movement. Gait dynamics of normal healthy people are also included in this study as control group. They are also put under study to perform dual task. This data set has been acquired from MIT-BIH data base. All these methods are capable to detect the difference between `Normal walking' and `Dual tasking' for both the groups. The fractal exponents for `Dual task' however produce interesting findings for PD subjects, suggesting that this type of walk is more chaotic and is more disordered than control group with the same task.

This study aims to define whether a dataset of gait parameters acquired in patients with idiopathic PD can be used to identify homogeneous groups separated from each other and corresponding to different PD phenotypes. An optoelectronic motion analysis system was used to obtain spatial-temporal parameters of PD patients during a single walking task. An unsupervised ML technique, namely clustering, was employed on gait parameters extracted from gait analysis to find different motor-phenotypes in PD patients. In particular, the $\boldsymbol{k}-\mathbf{means}$ clustering individuated two groups (Cluster 1 and Custer 2) with a specific gait-pattern. Cluster 2 was characterized by an increase of double support phase, stance phase and stance duration and a decrease of velocity, cadence, step and mean cycle length. These findings suggest that abnormalities in gait parameters may provide a data-driven PD phenotyping, which identify a worse motor and non-motor PD phenotype.","","979-8-3503-0080-2","10.1109/MetroXRAINE58569.2023.10405572","University of Salerno(grant numbers:FARB2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10405572","Parkinson's Disease;Gait Analysis;Clustering Analysis","Legged locomotion;Parkinson's disease;Neural engineering;Machine learning;Metrology;Task analysis;Motion analysis","","6","","46","IEEE","1 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the cognitive world, it stimulates thinking capabilities. It prompts a reaction to a particular situation and allows body parts to move. In addition, it also regulates other physiological functions such as digestion and respiration. The nervous system consists of billions of cells which interpret information from sensory elements and translate it into coordinated action performed by various parts of the body. With the increase in age, the steady decline of these cells results in a loss of dopamine compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an unforeseen expansion of the movement of bodily extremities that results in this decline. Finding a cure for this disease is still an enormous challenge, and its progression can be slowed by early detection. The proposed work has been implemented with seven machine learning and deep-learning techniques, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbour, neural network model, and support vector machines for preemptively predicting PD. The model was implemented utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. This included the normal cases as well as those with PD. The findings showed that the random forest model was superior to others, achieving an accuracy of 86.70%. In contrast, the naive Bayes model displayed the lowest accuracy of 71.50%. In addition, both the random forest and support vector machine models showed the highest accuracy levels of 85.90%. Various other performance metrics such as computational time, AUC (the Area Under the Curve), F1-score, ROC curve area, and recall rate were utilized to predict the effectiveness of each technique. Comparative analysis identified that the least performing models are the k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayes methods. In the future, this method can be refined further by using a large dataset and employing deep learning models for higher predictive outcomes.","","979-8-3503-0644-6","10.1109/ICCICA60014.2024.10585049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10585049","Parkinson’s disease;k-nearest neighbour;machine learning;deep learning;neural networks;random forest;decision tree","Support vector machines;Deep learning;Radio frequency;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Brain modeling","","1","","20","IEEE","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So we explored the signal complexity of 21 normal controls (NCs), 26 PPD patients, and 47 PD patients in four frequency bands based on fuzzy entropy (FE). In slow 3 and slow 2 frequency bands, the complexity of patients with PD is higher than that of the PPD patients and NCs. The complexity of the NCs was higher than that of PPD patients. Significant complexity anomalies were found in the caudate, superior frontal gyrus, thalamus, precuneus, and precentral gyrus. There are significant correlations between complexity and regional homogeneity (ReHo), the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), gray matter density/volume (GMD/V), and clinical scores. Results showed that patients had abnormal complexity, and abnormal complexity is related to the frequency band.

The abnormality in the biochemical or electrical, structural or nervous system can cause the neurological disorders. In 2015, Global Burden of Disease estimated that the one third population of the world is affected by neurological disorders. These disorders are complex in nature and involves different diagnosis methods due to their heterogeneity. This heterogeneity range from dysregulation of immune system to neurodegeneration or pathological protein aggregation to development of functional abnormalities. These disorders involves both genetic and environmental factors.Due to their complex behaviour the diagnosis becomes erroneous as the accurate diagnosis requires correct results from clinical research. Clinical research is handicapped in a way to contribute in the better treatment of the disease as most of the neurological disorders display their symptoms at the secondary stage of the disease. One of such disorder is Parkinson disease that exhibit symptoms after 60 years of age in most of the cases. Hence it becomes utmost important to identify ways to provide better tools and technologies in this specific area to diagnose Parkinson Disease at an early stage to provide timely treatment to the patient.Predicting Parkinson’s disease at an early stage can have significant benefits for patients and healthcare providers. Early detection allows for earlier treatment and management of the disease, which can slow the progression of symptoms and improve the overall quality of life for patients.In this paper we are presenting the role of Machine Learning technique in the prediction of Parkinson disease at an early stage.

Nonetheless, Parkinson's disease speech datasets accessible in the open domain tend to be hampered by small sample sizes, imbalance in classes, and variability limitations, making the creation of high-quality machine learning models challenging. This study discusses the effects of data augmentation processes, such as the addition of Gaussian noise, interpolation, and scaling, for improving the quality and diversity of publicly available Parkinson's speech datasets.The proposed augmentation approaches impose controlled variation in speech-relevant features to enhance mode generalization and combat overfitting. Experimental performance shows that the methods result in a 4-7% accuracy boost for classification, and underrepresented samples are especially benefitted when compared with existing methods such as random sampling, continuous wavelet transform and normalization method. Comparative comparison validates that interpolation efficiently alleviates class imbalance, Gaussian noise benefits robustness towards real-world fluctuations in speech, and scaling supports maintaining key relationships between features.The statistical parameter such as mean of original feature value and augmented show 1-2% variation, this indicates that the original information is preserved using these augmentation techniques.The results indicate that a hybrid augmentation method can improve the reliability of computer-aided Parkinson's disease detection models significantly; enabling enhanced early diagnosis and patient monitoring.","","979-8-3315-0775-6","10.1109/GINOTECH63460.2025.11076974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11076974","Parkinson’s disease;Data Augmentation;Gaussian Noise;Interpolation;Scaling;Machine Learning","Interpolation;Adaptation models;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Gaussian noise;Speech enhancement;Data augmentation;Feature extraction;Robustness;Overfitting","","","","16","IEEE","17 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, there is a diagnostic potential of integrating different biomarkers relevant to PD to enhance the accuracy and robustness. These biomarkers encompass different data forms, such as 1D signals, 2D images, and 3D scans. However, a significant challenge arises from the limited availability of comprehensive datasets. Many datasets do not contain all relevant biomarkers for the same set of subjects, limiting the ability to study them together. To overcome this limitation, we adopt a fusion-based federated learning approach by training separate models on different types of speech biomarkers sourced from different databases. The central server, which acts like a diagnostic centre, unifies insights from different speech biomarkers across multiple sites evaluating the relevance of other diverse biomarkers from various sources. Through this fusion federated framework, we achieve an 85% classification accuracy in PD diagnosis by effectively integrating different speech data types from multiple sources.

The symptoms progress slowly over the years and for this reason, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is very complex, so it is important to support medical personnel in identifying and predicting the disease with Artificial Intelligence tools and techniques. This study proposes a new approach to predict disease onset and monitor patient progress through Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) that aims to provide clear and understandable explanations for decisions made by machine learning algorithms. Initially, different classification algorithms were evaluated and, by choosing the one with the best performance, the most significant features were identified through the use of SHAP. The model was subsequently re-evaluated with only the selected features, evaluating the use of the XAI for disease identification.

However, in the real free-living environment, we have encountered two issues: weak annotation and class imbalance, which could potentially impede the automatic assessment of Parkinson’s disease. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Parkinson’s disease assessment framework in free-living environment. Specifically, clustering methods are used to learn latent categories from the same activities, and use Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models to capture latent features of multiple activities. Then, to mitigate the impact of data imbalance, we augment bag-level data while retaining key instance prototypes. The new framework is applied to a PD dataset collected by wearable sensors in the wild. It achieves an impressive 73.49% accuracy in the fine-grained (normal, mild, moderate, severe) classification of PD severity based on hand movements.

A difficult challenge for making sure that people can live as independently as feasible is the correct identification of PD in the initial stages. Over the past few decades, artificial intelligence-based machine learning techniques for disease identification in medicine have become very popular. These techniques do not, however, offer a precise and rapid diagnosis. The total detection precision of methods connected to machine learning was insufficient. Italian medical control individuals and PD sufferers, mid-advanced patients treated to L-Dopa, separated into non-medication patients and early-diagnosed, were used to create a custom dataset using high-quality recordings of vocal assignments. The goal is to construct an accurate model that can accurately diagnose to identify PD early and begin treatment while it is still treatable, early diagnostic tools are required. However, current models contain drawbacks that can cause the disease to be misdiagnosed. The Unified PDRating Scale (UPDRS), a grading system for PD, could be continuously monitored with the use of the proposed framework, which could aid clinicians treat patients. According to the various ML pipelines, state-of-the-art is contrasted using various categorization methods&DL was also investigated utilizing a unique Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework. Outcomes demonstrate that KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes classifiers operate comparably to each other with KNN having a little advantage over SVM and DL in terms of categorization outcomes. The dominance of CFS as the top characteristic choice is much clearer. The chosen characteristics serve as pertinent vocal biomarkers that can distinguish between healthy people, early-stage PD patients who have not yet received treatment, and mid-advanced PD patients who have received L-Dopa. The proposed approach has a 0.10 RMSE error, which is less than that of current models and can identify PD. The recommended method can extract crucial vocal elements that can be used to identify PD early on.","","979-8-3503-4279-6","10.1109/ICAEECI58247.2023.10370827","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10370827","Deep Learning;Machine Learning;Performance Measures;Parkinson Disease;Vocal biomarkers","Support vector machines;Parkinson's disease;Pipelines;Electric variables measurement;Biomarkers;Recording;Naive Bayes methods","","","","16","IEEE","3 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Numerous symptoms, including stiffness, bradykinesia, difficulties with coordination, and voice irregularities, are brought on by this neurodegeneration. Dysarthria is another symptom of Parkinson's disease. The primary flaws of PD speaking are decrease in intensity, monotony of pitch and loudness, inappropriate silences, and a breathy voice. Clinical signs, such as the description of a variety of movement symptoms and medical observations, are frequently used for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD).

To address this issue, this study proposes a hybrid fusion approach that makes use of the visual information derived from different handwriting images and handwriting templates, significantly enhancing the performance in diagnosing Parkinson's disease. The proposed method involves several key steps. Initially, different preprocessed handwriting images undergo pixel-level fusion using Laplacian transformation. Subsequently, the fused and original images are fed into a pre-trained CNN separately to extract visual features. Finally, feature-level fusion is performed by concatenating the feature vectors extracted from the flatten layer, and the fused feature vectors are input into SVM to obtain classification results. Our experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance by only utilizing visual features from images, with 95.45% accuracy on the NewHandPD.

Exercise compliance is also affected by a loss of memory and decline in motivation in prescribed home-based balance training. We have developed the smarter balance system (SBS) incorporating multimodal biofeedback (visual plus vibrotactile) intended for clinical and home-based balance rehabilitation and assessed its efficacy on physical therapists' recommended dynamic weight-shifting balance exercises (dynamic WSBE) in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). The SBS consists of a smartphone and custom belt housing a processing unit, miniaturized sensors, and vibrating actuators (tactors). Visual and vibrotactile biofeedback guidance during dynamic WSBE is generated by the SBS's custom app based on 90% of the user's limits of stability (LOS). Ten individuals with idiopathic PD having impaired postural stability participated in one unsupervised session comprising 24 trials of the dynamic WSBE in a laboratory setting. Participants' limits of stability (LOS) in the anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral (M/L) direction were measured at the pre- and post-session. To assess the efficacy of SBS to provide guidance during balance rehabilitation using dynamic WSBE, cross-correlation (XCOR), position error (PE), and percent of tactor activation (PTA) were measured. There was a significant increase in LOS between the pre- and post-training session in both A/P and M/L directions. The average XCOR across all participants were 0.87 (SD = 0.11) and 0.76 (SD = 0.11) for the A/P and M/L direction respectively. The average PE and PTA for the A/P direction was 1.17 deg (SD = 0.60) and 65.35% (SD = 15.1) respectively and 0.74 deg (SD = 0.28) and 31.3% (SD = 16.42) in the M/L direction respectively.

Given the complex nature of Parkinson's disease, relying solely on motor symptoms for diagnosis may not be sufficient. To address this limitation, researchers have turned their attention to the identification and quantification of biomarkers that can serve as indicators of Parkinson's disease. Faradaic detection is a promising method for Parkinson's disease research, using electrochemical processes to detect and quantify biomarker like alpha synuclein. This approach helps monitor surface resistance, binding processes, and electrolyte resistance in the system. Quantification of biomarkers plays a crucial role in detecting early stages of the disease and tracking its progression. Through Faradaic detection methods, this study was able to measure the levels of specific biomarkers that are associated with Parkinson's disease. This approach allows for a more sensitive and accurate detection of Parkinson's disease, even in its early stages, which can improve the chances of early intervention and effective treatment.","","979-8-3503-3331-2","10.1109/SENNANO57767.2023.10352562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10352562","Parkinson’s disease;alpha synuclein;redox reagent;faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;biosensor","Surface impedance;Parkinson's disease;Current measurement;Surface resistance;Biomarkers;Real-time systems;Sensors","","1","","5","IEEE","19 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, traditional gait measurement approaches do not support continuous monitoring of gait and focus on collecting limited data points in controlled lab environments. However, with advancements in wireless technology, movement patterns can be recorded using small portable wearable devices. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressively disabling neurodegenerative disorder that is affecting gait and posture and consequently leads to higher risk of falling. Several research studies have looked into changes in the gait parameters of PD patients compared to healthy adults. However, there are only few studies with the focus on gait assessment of PD patients in the early stages as compared to patterns associated with patients at advanced stages. In addition, the number of gait-related studies in this domain using accelerometers on ankle is very limited. Knowing which body location could serve as a target place for accelerometers to provide accurate information is a necessary step toward the health assessment of PD patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the gait parameters of patients with mild or moderate PD using accelerometers on ankles. A number of gait parameters, including average stride time, stride time variability, stride time symmetry, and oscillation of acceleration in the mediolateral (ML) direction were calculated and compared between PD patients and healthy elderlies. Preliminary results indicate that features extracted from accelerometers on ankles can be effective in differentiating between healthy elderlies and PD patients at mid-stages of disease but less so at earlier stages of disease.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217906","Gait patterns;Parkinson's Disease;early diagnosis;preventive healthcare;wearble devices;data analystics","Accelerometers;Protocols;Diseases;Senior citizens;Acceleration;Monitoring;Legged locomotion","","6","","30","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four types of multivariate AJMD were investigated by eigenspace-maximal-information-canonical-correlation-analysis, which obtained maximal- information-eigen-coefficients (MIECes), the parameters for quantifying the correlation between two sets of joints located in two different body parts. The results show that healthy participants have significantly higher MIECes than the PD patients (p-value <; 0.0001).

Early diagnosis and treatment of PD are crucial for alleviating symptoms and slowing disease progression. However, accurately diagnosing PD is challenging due to the overlap of its symptoms with those of other disorders. This study proposes a multimodal framework that leverages voice signals and handwritten graphics for the diagnosis of PD. The approach involves preprocessing and segmentation of speech signals to spectrogram and the binarization of handwritten graphics (circle, spiral, and meander) for analysis, incorporating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Three pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and an attention-based neural network model were trained on both datasets. The integration of speech signals and HandDraw images facilitated a comprehensive multimodal analysis. The proposed DCNN with an attention network achieved a classification accuracy of 98.75% on the multimodal dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches. These results demonstrate the potential of the framework for improving PD diagnosis.","","979-8-3315-3025-9","10.1109/ICAIHC64101.2025.10956150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10956150","Parkinson’s Disease;HandDraw;Voice Signal Processing;Tremor;Multimodal;Classification","Graphics;Neurological diseases;Accuracy;Spirals;Parkinson's disease;Transfer learning;Motors;Speech processing;Spectrogram;Signal to noise ratio","","","","25","IEEE","14 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this study was to develop data-driven methods and test their clinimetric properties to detect and quantify PD motor states using motion sensor data from leg agility tests. Nineteen PD patients were recruited in a levodopa single dose challenge study. PD patients performed leg agility tasks while wearing motion sensors on their lower extremities. Clinical evaluation of video recordings was performed by three movement disorder specialists who used four items from the motor section of the unified PD rating scale (UPDRS), the treatment response scale (TRS) and a dyskinesia score. Using the sensor data, spatiotemporal features were calculated and relevant features were selected by feature selection. Machine learning methods like support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and linear regression, using ten-fold cross validation were trained to predict motor states of the patients. SVM showed the best convergence validity with correlation coefficients of 0.81 to TRS, 0.83 to UPDRS #31 (body bradykinesia and hypokinesia), 0.78 to SUMUPDRS (the sum of the UPDRS items: #26-leg agility, #27-arising from chair, and #29-gait), and 0.67 to dyskinesia. Additionally, the SVM-based scores had similar test-retest reliability in relation to clinical ratings. The SVM-based scores were less responsive to treatment effects than the clinical scores, particularly with regards to dyskinesia. In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that using motion sensors during leg agility tests may lead to valid and reliable objective measures of PD motor symptoms.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2898332","Swedish Knowledge Foundation; Swedish Innovation Agency; Acreo; Cenvigo; Sensidose; Uppsala Universitet; Örebro University; Högskolan Dalarna; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637809","Leg agility;Parkinson's disease;support vector machine;stepwise regression;predictive models","Legged locomotion;Diseases;Foot;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Standards;Acceleration","Aged;Exercise Test;Female;Gait;Humans;Levodopa;Lower Extremity;Male;Models, Statistical;Monitoring, Physiologic;Parkinson Disease;Support Vector Machine;Wearable Electronic Devices","22","","39","IEEE","8 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its diagnosis is mostly based on symptom analysis, and it impairs mobility, coordination, and muscular control. Tremors, stiffness, delayed movement, and trouble walking are common signs of the condition, as stated by doctors. Furthermore, alterations in voice are highly prevalent in PD patients, however Some tweaks are not immediately detectable at a preliminary phase. The condition would alter our respiration, tone of voice, and loudness by up to ten decibels. Several research have demonstrated that one of the first signs of PD is changes in speech, hence a Parkinson dataset containing biomedical human voice is employed. As a result, speech recognition has the potential to bring a novel approach to the evaluation and treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The goal of this review is to give comparative research on the methodologies created using machine learning techniques in Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. Machine Learning algorithms are being used to treat Parkinson’s disease. A data collection of speech characteristics is used to determine whether and someone is in good health. If impacted, the harshness may be determined and likely treated accordingly. Models such as Random Forest classification, K Nearest Neighbour, XGBoost and Support Vector Machine are used in the suggested study. Principal component analysis is also used to minimize the amount of characteristics (PCA). These models’ performance is assessed and contrasted. Using the PD dataset, these models achieve an accuracy of 70% to 91%. Superior performance models are being explored for ensembles as well as to improve overall performance standards. The ensemble of models is employed to achieve the greatest accuracy of 91% and exact disease detection.","","979-8-3503-9781-9","10.1109/TEMSMET56707.2023.10149929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10149929","PD;Diagnosis;Symptoms;Machine Learning;Algorithms","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Speech recognition;Medical diagnosis;Ensemble learning;Standards;Random forests","","9","","13","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The diagnosis of PD can be difficult, especially in its early stage since there are no existing specific biomarkers. Most biomechanical data characterizing human movement is shown as time series or temporal waveforms representing different joint measures. Principal component analysis (PCA) can be used as a tool to identify differences in gait between healthy persons and those diagnosed with PD. The purpose of this study is to compare hip and knee kinematics during walking in PD group and control (CO) group using PCA, and to identify the specific PCA variables that can be used for differentiating Parkinsonian gait from normal gait. The subjects were divided into two groups: PD group n = 15, control group n = 12. Each subject performed a gait task and kinematics of limbs was measured using nine degrees of freedom inertial measurement unit (IMU). PCA was performed on the angular velocity of right and left side hip and knee joints in the sagittal plane of the gait cycle. Different numbers of principal components (PC) are needed to describe important information from hip (PC - 3) and knee (PC - 4) joints in sagittal plane. Statistically significant differences were found between PD and CO groups: right hip PC3 (p=0.0026); left hip PC3 (p=0.0262); right knee PC3 (p=0.0286). The PCA applied in this paper identified differences in gait features between PD and CO groups. Identification of these differences between PD and CO groups could clarify PD progress.","","978-1-5386-2396-1","10.1109/BIOMDLORE.2018.8467197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8467197","lower limb;gait analysis;IMU;principal component analysis;Parkinson's disease","Hip;Knee;Principal component analysis;Diseases;Loading;Kinematics;Angular velocity","","4","","11","IEEE","20 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Key discriminative features included turn duration, sit-to-stand time, and stand-to-sit time, which demonstrated potential as objective digital biomarkers for early-stage Parkinson’s disease detection. Additionally, higher motor impairment scores were associated with increased shank range of motion and prolonged turn duration, particularly during dual-task conditions.

Gait analysis helps physicians accurately assess the condition and optimize treatment options. Specifically, video-based gait analysis provides more accurate, comprehensive, and accessible gait analysis and captures the details of movement throughout the body. To improve patient diagnosis and treatment, this paper proposes a Frequency-Amplitude Enhanced Dynamic Time Warping (FAE-DTW) method to quantitatively analyze gait motion before and after medication. By designing a frequency-sensitive distance metric that incorporates the frequency and amplitude characteristics, we can evaluate the efficacy of medication by measuring the improvement or worsening of gait abnormalities. We have validated the effectiveness of this approach with real-world data.","","979-8-3503-8609-7","10.1109/IEEM62345.2024.10857077","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10857077","Parkinson’s disease;feature extraction;video-based analysis;dynamic time warping","Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy;Dynamics;Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Time measurement;Frequency measurement;Gait recognition;Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases","","","","12","IEEE","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The management and treatment of the condition require accurate diagnosis and early identification of the infection. This paper outlines a novel deep-learning model that integrates CNNs and SVMs to improve the classification of the photos into five types of Parkinson’s disease. The model attempts to enhance the computerized diagnosis of the illogical clusters of diseases by applying a set of 300 pictures, including 200 images of sick persons and 100 pictures of healthy persons. The photos, for instance, underwent a rigorous normalization and data augmentation process to optimize the learning process and model robustness. On this split, the model started training 70% of the data for training purposes, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. The results proved to be very convincing. The results of experiments show that the model is relatively accurate, with an overall accuracy of 96%. The precision rates vary between 82, and as low as 71%. 64% to 92. 0% to 63%, while the average recall rate varies from 81. 59% to 93. they are 70% for the sel categoillnesses that have people. F1-scores obtained ranged from 82: 11% and 91. Thus, the algorithm achieves a balanced performance in terms of accuracy and recall, which is 16%. These measurements shall verify the model’s ability to significantly aid in the early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, augmenting future treatment strategies and patient outcomes.","","979-8-3503-5421-8","10.1109/ASIANCON62057.2024.10837720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837720","Parkinson's Disease Identification;diagnosis;Convolutional neural networks;SVM;Strokes;Action;neurological disorder","Training;Technological innovation;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Hydrocephalus;Feature extraction;Data models;Diseases;Testing","","","","15","IEEE","21 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the DBS is in an open-loop pattern with which the stimulation parameters remain constant regardless of fluctuations in the disease state, and adjustments of parameters rely mostly on trial and error of experienced clinicians. This could bring adverse effects to patients due to possible overstimulation. Thus closed-loop DBS of which stimulation parameters are automatically adjusted based on variations in the ongoing neurophysiological signals is desired. In this paper, we present a closed-loop DBS method based on reinforcement learning (RL) to regulate stimulation parameters based on a computational model. The network model consists of interconnected biophysically-based spiking neurons, and the PD state is described as distorted relay reliability of thalamus (TH). Results show that the RL-based closed-loop control strategy can effectively restore the distorted relay reliability of the TH but with less DBS energy expenditure.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2952637","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61501330,61372010); Tianjin Municipal Special Program of Talents Development for Excellent Youth Scholars(grant numbers:TJTZJH-QNBJRC-2-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895773","Closed-loop DBS;reinforcement learning;relay reliability;basal ganglia network;Parkinson’s disease","Neurons;Satellite broadcasting;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Biological system modeling;Relays;Membrane potentials","Algorithms;Basal Ganglia;Computer Simulation;Deep Brain Stimulation;Humans;Learning;Neurons;Parkinson Disease;Reinforcement, Psychology;Reproducibility of Results;Thalamus","35","","36","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
