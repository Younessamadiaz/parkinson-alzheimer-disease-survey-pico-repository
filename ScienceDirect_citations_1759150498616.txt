Abstract: Osteoporosis is an age-related bone metabolic disease characterized by a persistent bone mass decrease and bone structure destruction. Osteoclasts, important cells in the bone remodelling process, are closely associated with the onset and progression of osteoporosis; however, the regulatory mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study, TFE3 cytoplasmic translocation inhibited LAMP2A expression in osteoclasts and precursors in elderly individuals with osteoporosis and the downregulation of LAMP2A expression mediated the attenuation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). This inhibition prevented intracellular CCR5 degradation, increased the osteoclast differentiation of osteoclast precursor cells, and enhanced the bone resorption activity of mature osteoclasts, leading to bone loss and remodelling. In addition, we constructed osteoclast-targeted nanoparticles carrying CMA activators and demonstrated that enhancing osteoclast CMA activity in vivo inhibited the abnormal bone resorption activity of osteoclasts, thereby effectively increasing bone mass and alleviating osteoporosis progression. This study revealed that LAMP2A-mediated CMA activity in osteoclasts and their precursors negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activities both in vivo and in vitro. The attenuation of LAMP2A-mediated CMA activity plays an important role in the development of osteoporosis, and enhancing LAMP2A-mediated CMA activity represents a potential therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis.

Abstract: Background
Impaired postural control, attributed to abnormal function of motor-related cortices, has been proven as one of the potential mechanisms of chronic low back pain (CLBP). Based on available evidence, anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1-tDCS) can significantly enhance cortical activation and improve postural control. However, the neuromechanism underlying the effect of anodal M1-tDCS on patients with CLBP remains unclear.
Methods
Twenty-six participants with CLBP were randomly assigned to the active tDCS group or sham group. A 20-minute session of anodal M1-tDCS or sham intervention was applied. Before and after the intervention, postural control performance and cortical activity during unipedal standing were assessed by center of pressure displacement and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), respectively. Regions of interest (ROIs) included bilateral primary motor cortex (M1), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), frontopolar area (FpA), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Functional connectivity (FC) among these ROIs was also analyzed.
Results
Significant interactions (Group × Time) were observed in anterior-posterior (AP) velocity, sway length, left M1 activation, and FC between left M1 and right DLPFC, as well as between the left M1 and bilateral FpA (ps<0.05). Post-hoc comparisons demonstrated that AP velocity and sway length significantly decreased after the anodal M1-tDCS intervention (pFDR<0.001, effect size (d)= 2.060). Additionally, participants in the active tDCS group exhibited significantly reduced left M1 activation (pFDR<0.001, d=1.894), FC between the left M1 and right DLPFC (pFDR=0.008, d=1.420), and FC between the left M1 and bilateral FpA (left: pFDR=0.006, d=1.461; right: pFDR=0.027, d=1.227) after the intervention.
Conclusion
The improvement in postural control of patients with CLBP following anodal M1-tDCS, accompanied by reduced cortical activation and functional connectivity, suggests enhanced neural efficiency (more efficient neural processing) and reduced compensatory demands within sensorimotor networks.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in the understanding of multiple sclerosis and the development of biomarkers of pathophysiology prompted a substantial revision of the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria. The new 2024 McDonald criteria provide a unified approach for diagnosing multiple sclerosis in individuals with relapsing or progressive courses throughout the lifespan (ie, from paediatric to late-life presentations). The optic nerve can now serve as a fifth anatomical location within the CNS for diagnosis. The central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and kappa free-light chain concentrations in CSF can be used, when available, to provide supportive evidence and confer specificity for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in specific situations. In certain cases, radiologically isolated syndrome or neurological symptoms that do not constitute a clear attack or progression of disability can fulfil the criteria for a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. We also provide guidance for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older individuals (≥50 years) and those with comorbidities. The 2024 revised criteria should expedite the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, while maintaining specificity.

Abstract: Abstracts
Background
Mogroside V (MV) constitutes the primary bioactive compound within Siraitia grosvenorii and has significant therapeutic effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, and nervous system damage. Presently, there exists a shortage of comprehensive reviews explaining its therapeutic mechanisms through core signaling pathways.
Aim
To systematically organize and summarize recent advances MV's molecular mechanisms and its therapeutic potential.
Methods
The potential mechanisms of MV on the above diseases were explored by searching relevant literature published in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, combined with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis.
Results
MV mediates its multifaceted biological functions via key signaling cascades. Anti-inflammatory actions are facilitated through pathways of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), Protein kinase B/ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mechanistic target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-unfolded protein response (ERS-UPR). For anti-oxidant defense, MV predominantly engages the Nuclear (factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1) Nrf2/HO-1, PI3K/Akt, and sirtuin (SIRT) pathways. Furthermore, MV regulates metabolism and offers therapeutic potential by targeting the AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) pathway in obesity, modulating the PI3K/Akt/ glucose transporter type 2(GLUT2) axis for diabetes management, and activating the Taurine Upregulated Gene 1 (TUG1) pathway to enhance osteogenesis.
Conclusions
MV is a promising multi-target therapeutic candidate. Further studies on bioavailability optimization and clinical translation are warranted.

Abstract: Danon disease (DD) represents a rare and complex X-linked disorder, characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal muscle deterioration, and cognitive deficits. At its core, the disease stems from mutations in the LAMP2 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2) gene, which result in a critical deficiency of LAMP-2, particularly the LAMP-2B isoform. This loss destabilizes normal autophagic clearance, leading to the buildup of dysfunctional autophagic vacuoles that ultimately disrupt cellular homeostasis. Although accurately modeling the full range of DD symptoms remains challenging, patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and innovative LAMP-2-deficient animal models have provided valuable insights into the disease’s molecular and cellular basis. Recent research points decisively to mitochondrial dysfunction and fragmentation as pivotal contributors to disease progression, shifting our understanding of DD beyond lysosomal defects alone. These mechanistic revelations have inspired new therapeutic directions, with gene therapy emerging as a particularly promising candidate based on encouraging preclinical results and ongoing clinical studies. Moving forward, a deeper integration of molecular insights with therapeutic innovation will be essential to developing effective strategies that address the multifaceted pathology of DD and improve outcomes for affected individuals. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of DD, focusing on its genetic and molecular underpinnings, particularly the role of LAMP-2 deficiency in disrupting autophagy and mitochondrial integrity. We critically evaluate experimental models that have advanced our understanding of DD pathogenesis. Additionally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies, with an emphasis on gene therapy and other innovative approaches aimed at restoring cellular homeostasis and mitigating cardiomyopathy and neuromuscular symptoms.

Abstract: Potentially toxic elements (PTEs) such as As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn pose a considerable threat to ecosystems, food safety, and human health due to their toxicity, bioaccumulative nature, and environmental persistence. In situ immobilization using soil amendments has emerged as a cost-effective remediation strategy by reducing PTEs mobility and bioavailability and enhancing the soil quality. However, the long-term stability, ecological impacts, and economic viability of these amendments remain key challenges. This review critically examines scientific papers published from 2000 to 2025 on the use of agricultural byproducts and waste-derived materials such as manure, compost, biochar, and fishery residues, for the in-situ immobilization of PTEs. The dominant immobilization mechanisms (surface adsorption, precipitation, and complexation) and the influence of soil properties, amendment characteristics, and PTEs speciation on the immobilization efficiency are presented. By synthesizing current knowledge and identifying knowledge gaps, this review provides a framework for selecting appropriate, low-cost amendments for long-term, environmentally sound remediation of PTE contaminated soils.

Abstract: Apathy is characterized by loss of motivation and manifests as a reduction of goal-directed behavior. Apathy is highly prevalent across neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), and is an important contributor to the disability and reduce quality of life in these conditions. The treatment of apathy remains challenging due to a lack of specific therapies, largely attributed to an incomplete understanding of its cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings, crucial for developing targeted interventions. Apathy can be mechanistically studied through effort-based decision-making (EBDM) paradigms, where individuals choose between low- and high-effort tasks for varying reward magnitudes. Anatomically, apathy has been associated with alterations in brain regions previously implicated in EBDM. Using a novel transdiagnostic study design in individuals with AD and PD, we aim to: (1) evaluate the independent effects of reward and effort sensitivity as a mechanistic link between apathy and neurodegeneration of basal ganglia-frontal networks and, (2) in a subset of PD patients receiving deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, determine whether electrical manipulation of subthalamic nucleus and/or DBS connectivity, directly alter reward and effort information processing and, consequently, goal-directed behavior. Understanding how neurodegeneration—alone or in combination with neuromodulatory interventions—drives apathy, is essential for guiding clinical decision-making and therapeutic development. Given its prevalence across neurodegenerative disorders, apathy provides a unique framework for investigating shared and disease-specific neuroanatomical, functional, and behavioral mechanisms. In this protocol paper, we describe the rationale and methodology of our proposed multimodal approach, to investigate apathy in a transdiagnostic cohort of individuals with AD and PD.

Abstract: Treated sewage effluent (TSE) is a critical non-potable water source in arid regions such as Qatar, yet residual micropollutants pose environmental and health risks. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) offer promising solutions, but their performance in local wastewater matrices remains underexplored. A pilot-scale study evaluated ozonation (O₃), ozone–hydrogen peroxide (O₃-H₂O₂), and UV‑hydrogen peroxide (UV-H₂O₂) for micropollutant removal from ultrafiltration-treated TSE. Influent and effluent were analysed for 243 pesticides and 56 pharmaceuticals. Removal efficiency, electrical energy per order (EEO), and cost were assessed. Nine pesticides and fifteen pharmaceuticals were detected, including fipronil (0.413 μg/L), thiamethoxam (0.292 μg/L), iohexol (4.06 μg/L), and iopamidol (3.17 μg/L). Ozonation at 3–4 mg/L achieved 80–90 % removal for most pesticides; acetamiprid remained resistant (~50 %). Nearly all pharmaceuticals were reduced below reporting limits except iodinated contrast media, which UV-H₂O₂ removed most effectively (≈79–86 %). O₃-H₂O₂ improved the degradation of ozone-resistant compounds. EEO was <0.3 kWh m−3 for ozone-based AOPs for most of the compounds. A cost assessment at 200,000 m3/d showed unit costs of $0.019/m3 (O₃), $0.023/m3 (O₃–H₂O₂), and $0.124/m3 (UV–H₂O₂), confirming the economic advantage of ozone-based options at scale. Ozonation (dose of 1.0 mg O3/mg DOC) is recommended as the baseline AOP, followed by biologically active or granular activated carbon to address residuals and transformation products.

Abstract: Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) enhance localized drug concentration while minimizing systemic toxicity but face critical limitations of poor permeation efficiency and short retention time. Herein, we report a multifunctional TDDS integrating robust bioadhesion, on-demand detachment, enhanced permeation, and prolonged intra-articular drug retention for osteoarthritis (OA) pain-structure management. The Gel-GA@NPs(DS) DMSO gel TDDS is synthesized by heating and cool-annealing of gelatin (Gel), gallic acid (GA), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to establish chemical/physical crosslinking, followed by incorporation of cationic diclofenac sodium (DS)-loaded nanoparticles (NPs). Upon dermal application, this gel forms strong bioadhesion via “mechanical interlocking-multivalent bonds” strategy. Simultaneously, the adhered gel undergoes on-demand detachment via thermal gel-sol transition. Notably, transdermal efficiency is enhanced through four synergistic pathways: gap-free gel-tissue contact, thermally enhanced diffusion, DMSO-mediated transcellular permeation and NPs-facilitated transappendageal transport. Cationic NPs further prolong intra-articular retention via electrostatic cartilage anchoring, while permeated GA modulates joint microenvironment. In rodent OA models, Gel-GA@NPs(DS) gels achieve prolonged pain-alleviation and superior treatment. Given its bioadhesion, on-demand detachment, enhanced permeation-retention, biocompatibility, and scalable fabrication, this system demonstrates significant potential as a next-generation TDDS.

Abstract: In practical applications such as medical diagnosis and group decision making, the potential structural information contained in multi-dimensional features in the form of group domains plays an important role. However, most existing feature selection methods adopt transformed feature spaces for group structure analysis, which lack intrinsic semantic information interpretation. Meanwhile, fuzzy and uncertain heterogeneous data acquired from multiple devices increase the difficulty of task learning. Motivated by these two issues, this work devises a Heterogeneous Feature Selection method with Group Structure Mining in fuzzy decision systems (HFS-GSM), which follows the principle of one “strategy" and one “mechanism". Specifically, a feature group generation strategy based on fuzzy approximation Markov blanket is first designed for mining features with group structure, which introduces the concept of Markov blanket into the fuzzy rough set and utilizes the idea of approximation and fuzzy uncertainty measures. Then, a fuzzy dependency-based overlapping group elimination mechanism is proposed by attribution division, which avoids local redundancy while preserving global discriminative information. Furthermore, the effectiveness of HFS-GSM is verified in comparison with seven representative feature selection methods on publicly available medical datasets. Finally, medical diagnosis data provided by a hospital are obtained to demonstrate the reliability and utility of HFS-GSM in practical applications.

Abstract: Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) pose a significant threat to global agriculture, with annual crop losses estimated at $157 billion. Although synthetic nematicides are effective, their extensive use raises concerns for environmental and human health, highlighting the need for safer, sustainable alternatives in horticulture and environmental biotechnology. This review delves into microbial strategies against PPNs, focusing on biocontrol agents (BCAs) such as bacteria and fungi that produce nematicidal compounds, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), secondary metabolites, toxins, and extracellular enzymes. These BCAs, often attracted by plant root exudates, interact within the rhizosphere to suppress nematodes, offering promising, eco-friendly control methods for sustainable agriculture. Advances in multi-omics techniques-proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics-have accelerated the discovery of novel nematicidal compounds, paving the way for new applications in biocontrol. Notably, nematophagous fungi (NF), present in diverse taxa such as Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, exhibit significant potential through direct (e.g., parasitism, toxin production) and indirect (e.g., lifecycle disruption) effects on nematodes. This review underscores the ecological roles, taxonomy, and mechanisms of NF in sustainable horticulture and agriculture and advocates for the integration of microbial biocontrol within an integrated pest management (IPM) framework. Such an approach is essential to reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides, enhance nematode control, and promote resilient agroecosystems.

An amino acid transporter in the small intestine mediates basolateral efflux of plant-derived nicotianamine iron complexes,

Abstract: Nicotianamine (NA), a plant-derived metal chelator abundant in vegetables, is a bioavailable iron-chelating compound in mammals. We recently reported that NA-iron (NA-Fe) complexes are absorbed in the small intestine via a proton-conjugated amino acid transporter (PAT1). However, the subsequent process remains unknown. In this study, using radioactive iron tracers and NA export quantification in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we identified the heterodimeric amino acid transporter as being responsible for transporting NA-Fe(II) complexes into the vascular system; this complex is composed of L-type amino acid transporter 2 (LAT2) and 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc). Oocytes expressing LAT2/4F2hc exhibited significantly higher efflux of NA-59Fe(II) than free Fe via ferroportin 1, indicating an NA-Fe(II)-specific excretion mechanism. A LAT2 mutant (N134S), which is known to enhance amino acid efflux, also increased radioactive iron-NA excretion. Molecular modeling revealed that the substrate-binding cavity of LAT2 could accommodate NA-Fe(II), suggesting that NA-Fe(II) could be transported through the same cavity entrance as amino acids. The expression profiles of PAT1 and LAT2/4F2hc in the small intestine were higher in the proximal jejunum than in the duodenum, which was consistent with the NA and iron content profiles in the small intestine of mice treated with NA-Fe(II). These findings suggest the presence of different iron absorption mechanisms. Iron is directly absorbed in the duodenum via the divalent metal transporter 1/ferroportin 1 system and as an iron-chelator complex in the proximal jejunum via the PAT1/LAT2(4F2hc) amino acid transporter system.

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by deficient social interaction, altered communication, and repetitive, stereotyped behaviors. Pathologically, ASD is characterized by abnormal brain development, including dendritic spine and axonal alterations, which are both associated with synaptic plasticity disturbances. Microtubules (MT) and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) are critical in regulating brain development by the neuronal cytoskeleton and synaptic formation. Tau is a neuronal MAP protein in which pathological posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this context, accumulative evidence suggests that tau is altered in mouse models and human patients of ASD. Toxic tau modifications like hyperphosphorylation, a disruptor of MTs dynamics, produced alterations in ASD, suggesting that the imbalance of this protein may contribute to neurodevelopmental deficiencies produced during ASD. In this systematic review, we revised essential evidence suggesting that the dysregulation of cytoskeletal components produced by tau pathology could play a crucial role in the pathological and behavioral changes produced in ASD. Finally, we will focus on discussing how the presence of tau pathology in ASD contributes to brain development impairment and whether pathological forms of tau could be suggested as a novel biomedical strategy to support the diagnosis of this disorder.

Abstract: This study advances current understanding of career shocks among non-standard workers by investigating how social entrepreneurs, as a novel group of non-standard workers pursuing purpose, engage in sensemaking during career shocks. Our inductive analysis of in-depth interviews with 39 Bangladeshi social entrepreneurs facing a crisis revealed three distinct sensemaking patterns: ‘mission-neglected preservation,’ ‘mission-protective collaboration,’ and ‘mission-validating continuity’ based on identity structure and disruption valence. These patterns explicate how the same external events can generate varied career shock experiences.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Fractures related to osteoporosis and low bone mineral density lead to substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost to individuals and health systems. Here we present the most up-to-date global, regional, and national estimates of the contribution of low bone mineral density to the burden of fractures from falls and additional categories of injuries from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021.
Methods
The burden of low bone mineral density was estimated from 1990 to 2020 in terms of years lived with disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and deaths, for individuals aged 40 years and older, using data from population-based studies from 48 countries or territories (169 unique sources). Mean standardised femoral neck bone mineral density values were estimated by GBD location, age, and sex by meta-regression. Based on a separate meta-analysis of population-based studies from nine countries (12 unique sources), we also estimated the pooled relative risk of fractures per unit decrease in bone mineral density (g/cm2). The population-attributable fraction for low bone mineral density was calculated by comparing the observed distributions of standardised femoral neck bone mineral density to an age-specific and sex-specific counterfactual distribution, defined as the 99th percentile of five rounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA, by 5-year age group and sex. Hospital and emergency department data were used to derive the incidence of fractures for six categories of injury (road injuries, other transport injuries, falls, non-venomous animal contact, exposure to mechanical forces, and physical interpersonal violence) using ICD codes. Deaths due to fractures were estimated as the proportion of in-hospital deaths due to the specified injury causes for which a fracture (nature of injury code) was more severe than the cause of injury code. YLDs and DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density by cause of injury were also determined according to previous GBD methods.
Findings
In 2020, 8·32 million (95% UI 5·58–10·84) YLDs, 17·2 million (14·1–20·2) DALYs, and 477 000 (411 000–536 000) deaths were attributable to low bone mineral density globally in individuals aged 40 years and older. Between 1990 and 2020, global YLDs, DALYs, and deaths attributable to low bone mineral density increased by 91·8% (88·5–95·1), 89·8% (81·5–99·0), and 127·1% (108·5–144·5), respectively. Over this period, the age-standardised global rates of YLDs, DALYs, and deaths attributable to low bone mineral density showed modest decreases. In 2020, falls accounted for 76·2% (95% UI 74·2–78·3) of YLDs, 65·2% (62·9–67·6) of DALYs, and 71·0% (67·4–72·8) of deaths attributable to low bone mineral density, and road injuries largely accounted for the remaining amount: 12·4% (11·1–13·6) of YLDs, 24·6% (22·5–27·1) of DALYs, and 23·1% (21·6–26·2) of deaths. As a proportion of all fall-related burden, low bone mineral density accounted for 26·6% (23·2–28·7) of YLDs, 25·6% (22·1–27·4) of DALYs, and 40·6% (35·4–44·0) of deaths in 2020. Of all road injury-related burden, 12·6% (10·8–13·5) of YLDs, 6·3% (5·4–6·9) of DALYs, and 8·9% (7·6–9·6) of deaths were attributable to low bone mineral density. In men, road injuries accounted for the largest proportion of DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density in those aged 40–59 years and the largest proportion of deaths in those aged 40–64 years. In women, road injuries were the leading cause of DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density in those aged 40–44 years and the leading cause of deaths attributable to low bone mineral density in those aged 40–54 years. In older age groups among both men and women, falls were the leading cause of the burden attributable to low bone mineral density.
Interpretation
Low bone mineral density is a crucial modifiable risk factor for fractures, which are an important cause of morbidity and mortality particularly in ageing populations. This analysis highlights low bone mineral density as a cause of health loss not just from falls, but also from road injuries.

Abstract: Background and aims
Insulin resistance is a key driver of metabolic disorders, yet its molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study identifies 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), a cholesterol-derived metabolite, and investigates its role in insulin resistance.
Methods
Targeted metabolomics quantified absolute and relative levels of 27HC (27HC/cholesterol ratio) in patients, mice, and hepatocytes. Insulin resistant mouse models were established to characterize spatiotemporal dynamics of 27HC and related enzymes. Functional analyses assessed 27HC's effect on insulin signaling across multiple hepatocyte types. Transcriptomic analysis identified key effector pathways. Plasma membrane cholesterol accessibility was evaluated using biosensors and validated by cholesterol rescue. Membrane protein extraction, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were employed to assess the impact of 27HC on insulin receptor (IR) distribution and binding capacity.
Results
Elevated 27HC levels were observed in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), obese and type 2 diabetic mice (T2DM), and PA-treated HepG2 and primary hepatocytes, correlating with impaired insulin sensitivity. CYP27A1 was identified as the key enzyme regulating liver 27HC levels. In vitro studies demonstrated that 27HC disrupts insulin signaling in HepG2, AML12, and primary hepatocytes, whereas CYP27A1 knockdown restored IR responsiveness. 27HC suppresses SREBP2-dependent cholesterol biosynthesis, depleting accessible cholesterol in the plasma membrane, triggering IR mislocalization and signal attenuation. Liver-specific CYP27A1 silencing in mice fed a high-fat diet improved systemic insulin sensitivity and restored metabolic homeostasis.
Conclusion
Our findings establish 27HC as a key effector linking cholesterol metabolism to insulin resistance and propose CYP27A1 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy for insulin resistance.

Abstract: The process of mitochondrial fission is a major determinant of mitochondrial homeostasis. DRP1 is the chief architect of the mitochondrial fission process, and the DRP1 recruitment to the mitochondrial outer membrane is necessary for the mitochondrial division. DRP1 contributes to cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation, enhancing resistance to therapy, inhibiting apoptosis, suppressing immune responses, and sustaining cancer stem cell heterogeneity and self-renewal. Moreover, DRP1 drives metabolic reprogramming to support enhanced energy production and biosynthesis required for tumor growth and survival. In addition, DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission also favours NLRP3 inflammasome activation within the tumor microenvironment, which regulates cancer progression. Interestingly, elevated levels of DRP1 expression have been identified as a significant prognostic marker, correlating with poor survival outcomes across multiple cancer types. Many DRP1 inhibitors have been developed for cancer treatment, but more specific and selective agents are needed to improve efficacy and reduce off-target effects. A comprehensive understanding of DRP1's role in cancer cells is essential for developing DRP1 inhibitors, which hold promise as novel anticancer therapies and may enhance the effectiveness of conventional treatments.

Abstract: Summary
We developed SpliPath as a generalizable framework to discover disease associations mediated by rare variants that induce experimentally supported mRNA splicing defects. Our approach integrates components of burden tests (BTs), traditional splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) analyses, and sequence-to-function AI models (SpliceAI and Pangolin). Central to the workings of SpliPath is our concept of collapsed rare variant splicing QTL (crsQTL). crsQTL groups rare variants that are predicted to alter splicing in the same way, specifically by linking them to shared splice junctions observed in independent (unpaired) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. We demonstrate the utility of SpliPath through applications in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Through this, we showcase scenarios where SpliPath detects genetic associations that cannot be recovered by more simplistic combinations of BT and SpliceAI. We also nominate crsQTL for splice defects detected in large-scale analyses of ALS patient tissue.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) poses significant challenges to forensic toxicology, as traditional detection methods struggle to keep pace with their increasing complexity and diversity. To address this, we propose the NPS Fragment-Aware Chemical Language Model (NPS-FACL), a large language model (LLM) framework that enhances NPS detection by leveraging their inherent chemical substructures. Our approach utilizes fragment-aware tokenization, achieving a 20.33% reduction in token representation complexity, which contributes to a 2.01% increase in F1-score. Furthermore, the model integrates explainable uncertainty quantification, enhancing prediction reliability and providing insights into substructure-driven biases for improved forensic analysis of NPS. This work marks a shift towards explainable AI-assisted decision-making, providing proactive alerts and uncertainty-driven insights for early warning of emerging synthetic drug threats, in contrast to conventional Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) detection methods, which focus on molecule detection through extensive sample preparation and lack forward-looking predictive capabilities. Beyond forensic toxicology, the approach supports broader applications in public health surveillance, drug regulation, and harm reduction strategies by enabling rapid and scalable identification of novel substances.

Abstract: Copper ions (Cu2+), as essential trace elements, play a critical role in maintaining human physiological functions. However, disordered copper homeostasis, particularly excessive Cu2+ accumulation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various disorders. Moreover, the rapid advancement of modern industrial and agricultural practices has led to widespread Cu2+ contamination in the environment and food. Consequently, the development of a multifunctional portable test kit is significant for quantifying Cu2+ levels. In this work, a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (ZYC) was successfully developed for the detection of Cu2+ in several real samples. The probe ZYC exhibited outstanding performances, including NIR emission (λem = 660 nm), high selectivity and sensitivity (LOD = 11.7 nM), rapid response (30 s) and low cytotoxicity. The qualitative detection of elevated Cu2+ levels in soil samples was successfully achieved using ZYC. Remarkably, a portable test kit was designed, allowing it to be used for the rapid and on-site detection of excessive Cu2+ in herbs and vegetables. Furthermore, the fluorescence imaging of exogenous Cu2+ in live MCF-7 cells, zebrafish and nude mice was successfully achieved utilizing probe ZYC. Consequently, probe ZYC provides a new method for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of Cu2+-associated diseases, while the development of a rapid and on-site Cu2+ portable test kit provides a simple and convenient tool for monitoring food safety and environmental pollution.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the eco-friendly fabrication of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using a flavonoid- and protein-rich extract from Plectranthus amboinicus, a medicinal herb renowned for its therapeutic properties. UV–vis spectroscopy showed distinct absorbance peaks at 288 nm for the leaf extract and 358 nm for the synthesized ZnO NPs. X-ray diffraction (JCPDF file no. 00–036-1451) verified the presence of the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline phase in the nanoparticles. FTIR analysis revealed that flavonoids and proteins act as bio-reductants and facilitate the electron transfer to the Zn2+ ions, thereby converting them to their zero-valent (Zn0) state, leading to the formation of ZnO NPs. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analyses revealed spherical ZnO NPs with an average size of 58.24 nm. These nanoparticles exhibited potent antimicrobial effects, successfully inhibiting Shigella flexneri and Enterococcus faecalis, with biofilm inhibition rates surpassing 93 % at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. Antioxidant evaluations indicated a total antioxidant capacity of 75.5 ± 0.24 μg AAE/mg, a reducing power of 65.24 ± 0.73 μg AAE/mg, and 68.30 ± 0.16 % DPPH radicals scavenging activity at 200 μg/mL. Cytotoxic assessments showed the most significant activity at 200 μg/mL. The IC50 values were recorded as 58.53 μg/mL, 40 μg/mL, and 21.69 μg/mL for treatments at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Additionally, the fluorescence staining assay confirms significant apoptotic changes. The findings highlight the multifaceted potential of P. amboinicus-coated ZnO nanoparticles as viable candidates for functional foods and therapies, addressing antimicrobial resistance, oxidative stress, and cancer.

Abstract: The coastal oceans are shallow portions of the global oceans. These waters are important resources for developments of aquaculture, fishing, mining, shipping industries, oil and gas production, as well as tourism and recreation. More than 40% of the world's population lives within 100km of the coastline. Thus, protection of the coastal oceans is a great task for humanity. Coastal waters, however, are adversely affectedin many ways including overfishing, industrial pollution, and agricultural/river runoff. These practices may in turn affect coastal communities as fish availability varies, algal blooms occur, and water quality fluctuates through time. As the number of people living along the coast continues to increase, the impact of these activities on the coastal ecosystem will only intensify, and vice versa. Therefore, it is vital to monitor and understand how the coastal ocean environment and ecosystems are affected by both natural and human-caused impacts. This article briefs advances in applications of spaceborne and airborne remote-sensing technologies for monitoring of coastal ocean environments.

Abstract: The NASA Earth Science Division (ESD) is part of the Science Mission Directorate and was established to advance understanding of Earth as an integrated system through space-based observations of Earth's atmosphere, land, oceans, and biosphere. In the mid-late 1980s, the Earth Observing System (EOS) was conceived and implemented as a series of large “flagship” missions and smaller focused satellites, often in partnership with instruments and spacecraft from other nations and agencies. The EOS launched is first mission in 1999 and subsequently 9 additional missions highlighted in the first edition of this chapter. In the years since, NASA ESD has expanded its mission scope, science, and partnerships to include national, international, commercial, and academic partners in the quest to better understand our Home Planet and deliver decision-ready science-quality data that strengthens resilience, supports economic security, and guides effective Earth system management. These efforts safeguard the continuity of critical Earth System Data Records, which guide decisions related to long-term variability, extreme events, wildfire behavior, and global agricultural productivity among many other societal benefit areas.

Abstract: Objective
White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are linked to cognitive impairment and an increased risk of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. While the glymphatic system plays a key role in WMH pathophysiology, the relationship between glymphatic function and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in WMH remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate glymphatic function and CVR in WMH patients with varying lesion severity and cognitive status and to explore their relationship with cognitive performance.
Methods
A total of 132 participants were categorized into three groups based on Fazekas grade and cognitive function: controls (no/mild WMH), moderate-severe WMH without cognitive impairment, and moderate-severe WMH with cognitive impairment no dementia (WMH-CIND). Glymphatic function was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging-analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) and global blood oxygen level-dependent cerebrospinal fluid (gBOLD-CSF) coupling from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). CVR mapping was derived from rs-fMRI, and cognitive performance was evaluated using a comprehensive battery.

The ALPS-index showed a stepwise decline with increasing WMH severity and cognitive impairment (p<0.001). WMH-CIND participants exhibited lower gBOLD-CSF coupling compared with controls (p<0.05). CVR alterations were localized to frontal and occipital regions. Significant associations were observed between glymphatic indices, region-specific CVR, and cognitive performance across multiple domains.
Conclusion
These findings highlight the complex interplay between glymphatic dysfunction, localized CVR impairments, and cognitive decline in WMH. Preserving vascular health and optimizing glymphatic clearance may represent promising approaches for controlling WMH progression and its associated cognitive deficits.

Abstract: Phospholipid subclass recognition is crucial for biomedical research and clinical diagnosis. However, current recognition methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR), have some limitations, including complex sample preparation, high cost, and long recognition times. Although electrochemical methods have advantages in terms of speed and cost, current reports lack specificity in distinguishing phospholipid subclasses. To address this challenge, we developed a novel “AND” logic gate electrochemical recognition interface that integrates fragment imprinting recognition and signal probe labelling. Firstly, the fragment molecular imprinted polymer specifically recognizes phospholipid head groups to activate the “recognition procedure” of the “AND” logic gate. Secondly, β-cyclodextrin-modified silver nanoparticles (β-CD/AgNPs) label the phospholipid tails through hydrophobic interactions to amplify the signal response, thereby completing the “labeling procedure” of the “AND” logic gate. This recognition interface must operate according to a procedure of first recognition and then labeling in order to effectively distinguish phospholipid subclasses. As a proof of concept, phosphatidylethanolamine was chosen as a model analyte for validation. Compared with commonly used electrochemistry methods, the limit of detection (LOD) has been improved by six orders of magnitude, reaching the picogram level. This “AND” logic gate interface provides a universal method for the quantitative recognition of various phospholipids. It exhibits great potential for application in the fields of early disease diagnosis and food phospholipids recognition.

Abstract: Thermotolerance is critical for the commercial cultivation of Pleurotus giganteus in tropical regions, especially under the impact of global climate change. This study investigated the thermotolerance mechanisms of two P. giganteus strains with contrasting heat responses: the heat-tolerant PG46 and heat-sensitive PG79. Phenotypic assessments, antioxidant and metabolic enzyme assays, and comparative transcriptome analyses were performed under heat stress at 40 °C. Both strains exhibited post-growth rings, reduced recovery, mycelial and membrane damage, which was more severe in PG79. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase) and metabolic enzyme (laccase, cellulase, xylanase) initially increased and then declined, with PG46 consistently showing higher activity. Transcriptome analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) co-regulated in glycolysis, MAPK signaling, steroid biosynthesis, and protein processing pathways. In contrast, strain-specific expression patterns were observed in genes involved in ribonucleotide binding, zinc fingers, protein kinases, ubiquitination, cytochrome P450s, multicopper oxidases, MFS transporters, and 50S ribosome-binding GTPases, suggesting distinct molecular responses. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified six gene modules associated with heat exposure duration and seven with thermotolerance. Key genes involved in signal transduction, protein processing, transferase activity, and macromolecule metabolism were identified. qRT-PCR validation of six selected genes confirmed RNA-seq reliability. These findings provided comprehensive insights into thermotolerance mechanisms in P. giganteus, offering specific gene targets and regulatory pathways for genetic improvement, precision breeding, and optimized cultivation strategies under heat stress conditions.

Abstract: We study the effect of Lévy noise on phase synchronization in adaptive ensembles of excitable elements. We consider an ensemble of FitzHugh–Nagumo neurons with nonlocal coupling and a ring topology, under the external additive α-stable Lévy noise. A key feature of the model is the adaptive coupling tuning mechanism, which adjusts the strength of interactions between neurons based on a moving average of the interspike interval. The coupling strength increases during spikes with a large interspike interval and decreases during synchronous spikes, which allows the network to automatically adjust the minimum necessary total coupling strength to maintain a coherent regime even under strong noise with heavy distribution tails. We found that the coherent resonance characteristic of a single neuron is also observed in a coupled system. However, the optimal noise intensity shifts to lower values as the coupling range increases. Synchronization is achieved only at a certain coupling range, while at a lower coupling range only cluster synchronization is possible even with strong coupling of neurons. Lévy noise requires a stronger global interaction between neurons to achieve synchronization compared to Gaussian noise. However, the positive asymmetry of the noise distribution significantly reduces this threshold due to the increased sensitivity of neurons to positive fluctuations. The proposed adaptive mechanism successfully ensures synchronization of the system in the entire studied range of Lévy noise parameters and connection topology, demonstrating the versatility, high adaptation speed and energy efficiency of the approach. The obtained results open up new possibilities for controlled coordination of spatiotemporal dynamics in neural and other nonlinear excitable systems under extreme stochastic influences.

Abstract: The boom in using phytoconstituents for diseases treatment has been fueled by growth in the realm of nanotechnology. This is because nanomedicines not only expand the therapeutic applications of phytochemicals but also refine their physicochemical properties. Among multitude natural compounds prescribed for the treatment of health-related conditions are benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs). The BIAs predominantly found in opium poppy constitute morphine, noscapine, sanguinarine, papaverine, thebaine, and codeine, with a long history of applications in healing numerous diseases. However, they have problems regarding bioavailability, release, and targeting, which limit their druggability. Integration into nanoparticles has been found to hold great promise for improving the pharmaceutical properties of BIAs, while simultaneously mitigating their potential toxicity. Therefore, this review devotes special focus to recent studies demonstrating a considerable refinement in BIA therapeutic efficacy via the implementation of nanoencapsulation technology. However, the nanoformulations may pose the challenges of cost-efficiency, standard compliance, stability, and safety issue, necessitating further investigations to clear these drawbacks. We also discuss the capability of artificial intelligence (AI), organs-on-a-chip, and carrier-free nanoparticles for toxicity and efficacy assessment and druggability improvement, respectively. Taken together, information present here provides valuable insight into the power of nanoparticles for enriching BIAs and ultimately facilitating their clinical translation.

Abstract: HIV continues to be a significant global health issue, especially regarding its connection to the opioid epidemic. Substance abuse heightens the risk of spreading HIV infection and is linked to treatment non-compliance, accelerated disease progression, and increased mortality. Recent studies link epigenetic changes with the emergence of opioid addiction and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite new insights, the lasting epigenetic effects of opioid abuse on the severity, progression, and outlook of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain unclear. HAND occurs even with adequate antiretroviral therapy, for which there are currently no effective treatments. The epigenome in the central nervous system (CNS) plays a crucial role in helping humans adapt to a changing environment, and its dysregulation can lead to various CNS disorders; however, the underlying mechanisms of such developments are poorly understood. At present, several epigenetic drugs are being developed and tested in clinical trials as supplemental therapies for CNS disorders, including age-related neurodegeneration, mood disorders, and behavioral disorders. Accumulated evidence suggests that future therapeutic strategies should prioritize the development of epigenetic drugs, or epidrugs, as adjunct therapies for treating CNS disorders, including HAND and addiction-related diseases. This review explores the epigenetic mechanisms governing HIV-related neurological impairment amid the influence of opioid abuse.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism, and other neurodegenerative diseases are classified as protein folding diseases because they share amyloid fibrils as a hallmark. Typically, amyloid fibrils accumulate and spread through tissue over time. It is assumed that this process is accelerated as protein quality control becomes overwhelmed in aged tissues. However, a deep understanding of how specific protein quality control factors interfere with fibril accumulation and thereby delay disease onset is lacking. Here, we show that the widely conserved serine protease HTRA1 is activated by tau fibrils and provide quantitative, topological, and temporal insights into the proteolytic degradation of soluble and fibrillar tau. Live cell fluorescence microscopy demonstrates the interaction of HTRA1 with tau fibrils and their proteolytic degradation in cells. Our data highlight the potential of HTRA1 to act in a cell non-autonomous defense mechanism against the intercellular spread of pathogenic protein conformations.

Abstract: Background
Speech impairment frequently occurs in Parkinson's disease (PD). The sequence effect, progressive deterioration in speed or amplitude of ongoing movement, is unique to PD and does not respond well to dopaminergic therapy. While subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) can improve various motor symptoms in PD, its impact on speech and the speech sequence effect remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of STN DBS on speech metrics including the sequence effect in people with PD.
Methods
Fifteen individuals with PD who underwent bilateral STN DBS surgery participated in this study. We utilized the sustained phonation (SP) test and the diadochokinetic (DDK) test, which were performed under both OFF and ON stimulation conditions. Primary outcome measures included total SP duration, mean intensity, DDK rates, and the speech sequence effect.
Results
STN DBS significantly improved the duration of SP without altering mean intensity. It also improved the rate of DDK syllable production for /pa/. However, it did not significantly change the speech sequence effect.
Conclusions
These findings indicate that while STN DBS can enhance certain speech parameters, it does not significantly mitigate the speech sequence effect. Further studies incorporating more comprehensive and functional speech assessment are needed to better understand the broader impact of DBS on speech and guide personalized treatment strategies for speech impairment in PD.

Abstract: Dementia is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative condition, characterized by overlapping and interlinked pathophysiological implications including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, Synaptic dysfunction, Lewy body formation, Tauopathy, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. This complexity is one of the main reasons why single-target therapeutic strategies have largely failed to provide curative outcomes. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on identifying convergent molecular hubs that integrate multiple pathological pathways. In this context, Munc18–1 (STXBP1), a key regulator of synaptic vesicle exocytosis via SNARE complex assembly, has emerged as a central node connecting multiple facets of dementia pathology. Beyond its canonical role in neurotransmitter release, Munc18–1 influences amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, modulates Tau phosphorylation through CDK5, and acts as a molecular chaperone for α-synuclein, thereby impacting amyloidogenic, Tauopathic, and Synucleinopathic pathways. Its dysfunction impairs synaptic integrity, disrupts BDNF signalling, and promotes neuroinflammatory responses through excitotoxicity and vesicle-mediated immune signalling. Notably, reductions or mutations in Munc18–1 have been consistently associated with cognitive decline in various dementia models. In the present article, we attempted to address that Munc18–1 could be a master regulator of multiple pathophysiologies associated with dementia and emerging therapeutic approaches that stabilize Munc18–1 and restore its multifaceted functions can be a novel strategy for the treatment of dementia.

Abstract: Growing concerns over environmental pollution have led to increased emphasis on Green Chemistry and, more specifically, Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC). These frameworks advocate for the reduction of hazardous substances, minimization of waste, and consideration of the entire life cycle of analytical procedures—from production to disposal. Within this context, miniaturized analytical techniques have emerged as sustainable and efficient alternatives to conventional methods. Among these, capillary liquid chromatography (cLC), nano-liquid chromatography (nano-LC), and various modes of capillary electrophoresis (CE)—including micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC), capillary isotachophoresis (CITP), capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF), and capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) have gained significant traction. Their advantages in terms of reduced solvent and sample consumption, enhanced resolution, and faster analysis times have made them particularly valuable in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. One critical application area is the chiral separation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which is increasingly vital in biotechnology, chemistry, agriculture, and especially the pharmaceutical industry. Electrokinetic chromatography (EKC) has proven to be an effective and versatile technique for this purpose, offering high resolution, flexibility, speed, and cost-efficiency. The growing availability of novel chiral selectors further enhances its appeal for the separation of enantiomeric drug compounds. This review provides an overview of recent advancements in miniaturized analytical techniques and highlights their applications in the biomedical and pharmaceutical sectors, with a particular focus on chiral separations using EKC.

Abstract: Background
REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by excessive electromyographic (EMG) activity and abnormal behaviors in REM sleep. We aimed to examine the temporal distribution of EMG activity and behaviors in REM sleep in isolated RBD (IRBD) to better understand its nocturnal REM sleep circadian dynamics.
Methods
We examined the EMG activity in the mentalis and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles plus the clinical manifestations occurring in the first (from 11.00 p.m. to 3.00 a.m.) and last (from 3.01 a.m. to 7.00 a.m.) REM sleep episodes in the video-polysomnogram (V-PSG) of consecutive IRBD patients and controls without RBD.
Results
We assessed the V-PSG of 45 IRBD patients and 39 matched controls. The last REM sleep episode showed higher EMG activity than the first in both patients (p = 0.010) and controls (p = 0.024). In patients, movements and vocalizations were more frequent and severe in the last REM sleep episode than in the first, but differences were not significant. In controls, the last REM sleep episode showed more simple minor movements (p = 0.026) of mild severity (p = 0.032) than the first. In both first and last REM sleep episodes, patients showed higher EMG activity (≥0.001) and more behaviors (≥0.001) than controls. REM sleep percentage, REM sleep duration, REM sleep latency and number of REM sleep episodes were similar between patients and controls.
Conclusions
When compared to the first REM sleep episode, the last REM sleep episode shows higher EMG activity and more frequent behaviors in both patients and controls, which are greater in patients than in controls. IRBD represents a pathological overrepresentation of the temporal physiological distribution of EMG activity and behaviors in REM sleep across the night.

Abstract: Background
Early detection of autoimmune psychosis (AP) mediated by anti-neuronal antibodies (Ab) is critical for achieving optimal clinical outcomes. However, evidence remains limited regarding who should be tested, and how to manage Ab positive cases. This large-scale study evaluates proposed clinical criteria for targeted Ab testing in psychiatric services, and describes the clinical course of seropositive patients.
Methods
Individuals with early psychosis (EP) or persistent psychosis (PP) were prospectively assessed with clinical criteria to determine high- or low-risk status for AP. Blood samples were collected for Ab testing using a fixed cell-based assay. Seropositive individuals were invited for detailed review, including clinical, functional, and cognitive assessments at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Blood samples were collected from 754 individuals (n = 352 EP, n = 402 PP).
Results
Ab were present in 2.3% (17/754), including 3.4% (12/352) of EP and 1.2% (5/402) of PP patients. AP was confirmed in two cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) positive high-risk individuals (Total: 2/754, 0.3%; EP: 1/352, 0.3%; PP: 1/402, 0.2%). Both improved with immunotherapy. Although some low-risk patients were seropositive, none were diagnosed clinically with AP.
Conclusions
AP prevalence was low in this cohort. Targeted testing informed by clinical high-risk criteria successfully identified two immunotherapy-responsive AP cases. This approach appears feasible, but requires further validation. People with psychosis and high-risk AP features should be considered for Ab testing in sera and CSF where indicated. Further research is required to embed targeted Ab testing into mental health services.

Abstract: This study investigated 3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-4-(phenylselenyl)-1H-pyrazole (SePy) antidepressant-like potential using in vivo, ex vivo, and in silico approaches and evaluated its hepatic and renal safety profile. Male Swiss mice received lipopolysaccharide (LPS 0.83 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and were treated with SePy (10 mg/kg, i.g.) 24 h later. Antidepressant-like activity was evaluated using the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST). Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity was subsequently measured in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampi, and small intestine to investigate previously unexplored mechanistic pathways. SePy significantly reduced immobility time in both tests (TST and FST) and inhibited MAO-A and MAO-B activities in all regions analyzed. In silico docking indicated high affinity of SePy for catalytic residues of both MAO isoforms, comparable to the reference inhibitor isocarboxazide. Toxicological analysis of SePy (5–300 mg/kg) in female mice revealed no significant hepatic alterations (alanine and aspartate aminotransferase), although elevated urea and creatinine levels suggest possible renal effects at higher doses. Taken together, the results suggest that SePy may exert antidepressant-like effects via monoaminergic modulation and displays a favorable hepatic safety profile. Additional studies are warranted to confirm its renal safety and further explore its pharmacological potential under inflammatory conditions.

Abstract: Tens of millions of voting-eligible Americans live with disabilities, many of whom need a form of assistance when casting ballots. Drawing on publicly available administrative data from five recent general elections in Florida (2014–2022), we offer a portrait of individuals who have attested when registering to vote that they need assistance when voting. Then, leveraging turnout data as well as vote-by-mail (VBM) requests and returned ballot data from our five elections, we model turnout and the likelihood of having a rejected VBM ballot as a function of the need for voting assistance, among other voter-level factors. We find that the rate of registered voters needing assistance has remained steady in Florida at roughly three percent, that older and racial/ethnic minority voters are more likely to attest that they need assistance to vote, and that, all things equal, voters needing assistance not only have a lower overall turnout rate but also are slightly more likely to have their VBM ballots rejected than registered voters who do not indicate they need assistance to vote.

Abstract: Psilocybin, a serotonergic psychedelic, is gaining attention for its rapid and sustained therapeutic effects in depression and other hard-to-treat neuropsychiatric conditions, potentially through its capacity to enhance neuronal plasticity. While its neuroplastic and therapeutic effects are commonly attributed to serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor activation, emerging evidence reveals a more nuanced pharmacological profile involving multiple serotonin receptor subtypes and nonserotonergic targets such as TrkB. This review integrates current findings on the molecular interactome of psilocin (psilocybin active metabolite), emphasizing receptor selectivity, biased agonism, and intracellular receptor localization. Together, these insights offer a refined framework for understanding psilocybin’s enduring effects and guiding the development of next-generation neuroplastogens with improved specificity and safety.

Abstract: The design and preparation of efficient polyoxometalate-based electrocatalytic materials present a viable approach to achieve sensitive electrochemical sensing of ascorbic acid (AA). Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel organic-inorganic hybrid compound, H(H2en)3[AsMo8V4O40]·11H2O (1) (en = ethylenediamine), via a facile one-pot self-assembly method. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses show that hybrid 1 features a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular architecture, where arsenomolybdate [AsMo8V4O40]7− clusters are interconnected through hydrogen bonding interactions with protonated [H2en]2+ cations. Electrochemical analyses verified the excellent electrocatalytic activity of hybrid 1 toward AA oxidation. When utilizing hybrid 1 as an electrode material, the developed electrode exhibited superior analytical performance for detecting AA. It featured a wide linear detection range from 30 to 270 μM, a high sensitivity of 0.044 μA·μM−1, a low detection limit of 6.78 μM, and favorable selectivity and stability.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have gained widespread attention in recent years as promising materials for electrochemical sensing given their unique electronic, mechanical, and surface properties. Among various applications, CNTs have been utilized in the modification of electrodes for electrochemical sensing of biomolecules, including neurotransmitters. Catecholamines, including dopamine (DA), epinephrine (EPN), norepinephrine (NEPN), and serotonin (SE) constitute key neurotransmitters, which contribute to various physiological processes. Imbalances in catecholamine levels are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the need for rapid and accurate determination of these neurotransmitters in biological samples. This review article presents the main synthetic routes for CNTs, along with doping strategies, emphasizing their impact on CNTs’ properties. We summarize the recent progress in the integration of CNTs-modified electrodes for neurotransmitters detection in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and clinical sample analysis. Furthermore, we discuss ongoing challenges and future perspectives regarding the optimization of CNTs-modified electrodes applied in real-time diagnostic platforms, thus enabling effective monitoring of neurotransmitter levels in complex biological systems.

Abstract: The gut microbiota is often regarded as a crucial “metabolic organ,” profoundly influencing host metabolic health through various mechanisms. Natural plant polysaccharides are complex biomolecules composed of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds. They have a wide range of potential applications for host health due to their diverse structure and physicochemical properties. They serve as prebiotics, selectively promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting the proliferation of harmful bacteria. They metabolize the gut microbiota, producing active metabolites significantly influencing host metabolism, immunity, and inflammatory responses. This study aimed to systematically review the interaction mechanisms between natural plant polysaccharides, gut microbiota, and host metabolism. Additionally, it systematically summarized and emphasized the mechanisms by which natural plant polysaccharides influence the metabolism of fatty acids, bile acids, amino acids, and so forth, by regulating the gut microbiota. Moreover, the study provided an overview of the crucial role of the gut microbiota in maintaining the metabolic balance of the host and the effects of its dysregulation on metabolic diseases. It elucidated the mechanisms through which natural plant polysaccharides regulate the gut microbiota to enhance host metabolic health, thus providing essential theoretical foundations and practical guidance for precision nutritional interventions as well as the prevention and treatment of chronic metabolic diseases.

Abstract: Objective
Relative hypothermia is associated with tau accumulation. Furthermore, elucidating the association with changes in brain structure may be useful for the early detection and prevention of dementia. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between relative hypothermia and brain volume, especially gray matter and white matter, and to determine the cutoff point of relative hypothermia associated with brain structure.
Design
Cross-sectional.
Setting and Participants
The study included 101 community-dwelling older adults aged 60 to 90 years.
Methods
Relative hypothermia was defined as the percentage of time during the daytime active phase when body skin temperature, measured by a wearable device, was below the 24-hour average. Brain volume was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging, with gray matter atrophy and total white matter volume quantified. Multiple linear regression analysis examined associations between relative hypothermia and brain volume, while receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves determined cutoff points.
Results
Among 101 participants (mean age: 73.5 years; 48.5% female), relative hypothermia was significantly associated with gray matter atrophy (P < .05). The ROC analysis identified a significant cutoff point of ≥61.39% (area under the curve 0.763, P < .001). Relative hypothermia above this threshold (≥61.39%) was strongly associated with gray matter atrophy (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 4.11–4.99; P < .001).
Conclusions and Implications
Relative hypothermia is a strong marker of gray matter atrophy. A threshold of 61.39% or higher may serve as an early indicator of structural brain changes, contributing to dementia detection.

Abstract: Rationale
Chemobrain/chemofog, or chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), is considered a prevalent long-term complication among survivors. Doxorubicin (DOX), a well-known anthracycline administered in various cancers, drew much attention regarding inducing animal chemobrain models. On the other hand, using natural compounds as a safe and promising strategy for mitigating many pathological conditions, including chemobrain, has become a trend.
Objectives
In this review, we focused on the reported neuroprotective effects of 16 naturally derived bioactives, including galangin, juglanin, rutin, quercetin, catechin, naringin, astaxanthin, polydatin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, berberine, c-phycocyanin, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, alpha-lipoic acid, diosmin, thymoquinone, and curcumin against DOX-related cognitive deficit.
Results
Given the emphasis on learning, memory impairment, and exploratory behavior, our literature review suggests that reducing oxidative stress (OS), neuroinflammation, and apoptosis are core pathways. However, alterations in the levels of neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity, and other less frequent processes such as autophagy, brain mitochondrial dysfunction, necroptosis, and nitrogenic stress have also been reported.
Conclusion
Beyond the value of the published studies, there is still an urgent need for further research to evaluate natural compounds around this phenomenon with additional mimicking of the clinical settings, using novel formulations, and investigating the new insights into the mechanisms involved.

Misleading EEG in CACNA1A mutation: A case of late-onset episodic ataxia type 2,

Abstract: Background
Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) is a rare, autosomal dominant paroxysmal neurological disorder caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene. Its hallmark features include transient episodes of ataxia and dysarthria, often responsive to acetazolamide. However, misdiagnosis as epilepsy may occur due to overlapping electroencephalographic findings.
Case presentation
We report a 64-year-old woman with no prior history nor family history of neurological illness, who developed daily episodes of dysarthria and ataxic gait. Brain MRI did not show definite signs of cerebellar atrophy. Interictal EEG demonstrated sharp waves in the left temporal region, initially leading to a diagnosis of focal epilepsy. Despite trials of multiple antiseizure medications, symptoms worsened. Subsequent ictal EEG and SPECT showed no definitive seizure activity or clinical correlation. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous CACNA1A splice site variant (NM_001127222.2: c.2280-2A > T), confirming EA2. Tapering of antiseizure therapy and initiation of acetazolamide resulted in sustained symptom resolution.
Discussion
This case underscores the diagnostic challenge posed by interictal EEG abnormalities in CACNA1A-related disorders. While such findings may suggest epilepsy, they can be misleading in the absence of clinical epileptic seizures. Recognition of EA2 and judicious use of genetic testing facilitated accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Clinicians should be cautious in interpreting EEG in patients with paroxysmal neurologic symptoms and prioritize clinical correlation to avoid inappropriate therapy.

Abstract: The melting method of methane pyrolysis technology has garnered widespread attention due to its ability to address the carbon deposition deactivation problem that typically occurs in traditional catalytic cracking catalysts as well as its advantage of not directly emitting CO2 during the production process. It is viewed as a transitional bridge from fossil-based to renewable hydrogen production. However, while the pyrolysis reaction itself does not generate CO2 emissions, the temperature and energy required to sustain the reaction indirectly result in greenhouse gas emissions. To address this, this study integrates the inherent carbon separation capability of chemical looping combustion technology into the methane pyrolysis process, achieving a zero carbon emission target for both the pyrolysis reaction and energy supply processes. Thermodynamically, the system achieves the tri-generation of hydrogen, electricity, and carbon with an energy utilization efficiency of up to 85.06 % and life cycle emissions (LCE) of approximately 83.28 kg CO2 eq./kg MWh. Compared to traditional single-product systems, the LCE reduction rate can reach 87 %. Based on the allocation principle, the LCE of the poly-generation system is distributed, with the LCE associated with hydrogen production being only 0.44 to 0.58 kg CO2 eq./kg H2, which is significantly lower than that of other natural gas hydrogen production technologies. Furthermore, improving the raw material gas conversion rate, refining extraction technology, and utilizing clean electricity for natural gas and CO2 pipeline transportation can effectively reduce the LCE. For instance, utilizing wind, hydro, solar, and nuclear power for energy supply can reduce LCE by more than 40 % compared to coal-fired power systems.

Abstract: OSBPL2 was one of the causal genes responsible for autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNA) and the pathogenic mechanism of OSBPL2 mutations remain elusive. OSBPL2 was detected to be highly expressed in stria vascularis (SV) of mouse cochleae, in which the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB) was located as an essential component of cochlear spiral duct. The present study explored a potential pathologic mechanism of OSBPL2 deficiency underlying the structural and functional impact on BLB. Osbpl2-knockout (KO) mice were used to characterize SV permeability, which was measured using FITC-dextran injection. OSBPL2-deficient human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to evaluate the endothelial permeability in vitro. Tight junctions (TJs) in SV and HUVECs were characterized using immunofluorescent staining. The results showed that significant SV leakage was detected in cochleae of 10-month-old Osbpl2-KO mice, which was consistent with the increased endothelial permeability in OSBPL2-deficient HUVECs. It was also noted that OSBPL2 deficiency led to TJs disruption and induced inflammation-mediated apoptosis via the activation of NF-κB signaling. This study revealed the potential pathogenic mechanism of OSBPL2 deficiency in SV lesion, which helped to elucidate the underlying pathogenesis of OSBPL2 mutations in DFNA.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disorder, underscores the critical need for early diagnostic tools to mitigate its debilitating clinical trajectory. Central to PD pathology is the aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn), a protein whose misfolded forms drive neuronal dysfunction and serve as a hallmark biomarker. This review explores the transformative role of fluorescent probes in detecting α-syn aggregates and other PD-related biomarkers, offering unprecedented sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis. We systematically categorize probes into three classes, e.g., small molecules, nanomaterials, and macromolecules, detailing their design principles, mechanisms, and applications in real-time monitoring of α-syn fibrillation, dopamine metabolism, and oxidative stress pathways. Key advancements, such as the PP-BTA series for dual Aβ/α-syn detection and NIR-Lyso-FA for formaldehyde imaging, highlight the integration of multidisciplinary technologies to overcome current diagnostic limitations. Furthermore, we evaluate preclinical successes in animal models and emerging strategies for clinical translation, including high-throughput screening and multimodal imaging. By addressing challenges in probe standardization, biocompatibility, and scalability, this review provides a roadmap for advancing fluorescent probes from laboratory innovation to clinical utility, ultimately enhancing personalized therapeutic strategies and improving the quality of life for PD patients.

Abstract: Exosome- and extracellular vesicle (EV)-based biohybrid nanorobots represent a cutting-edge approach in nanomedicine, combining the natural targeting, immune tolerance, and molecular transport capabilities of EVs with the functional versatility of engineered nanomaterials. These hybrid systems can be designed for guided or autonomous navigation, enabling site-specific drug delivery with minimal cytotoxicity. Recent advances have integrated magnetic, photothermal, or drug-loaded components into EVs, transforming them into innovative nanoscale delivery systems. As naturally secreted vesicles from most cell types, EVs facilitate intercellular communication and are increasingly recognized for their clinical potential in treating conditions like Crohn's disease, type 1 diabetes, and COVID-19. Biohybrid EV nanorobots offer enhanced biodistribution, stability, and cellular uptake compared to traditional nanoparticles. Key design challenges include ensuring reproducibility, size control, and functional stability. This next-generation drug delivery platform holds promise for overcoming limitations of conventional systems while advancing targeted therapy and personalized medicine.

Abstract: Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent, demonstrates potential therapeutic benefits in treating non-parasitic ailments, particularly in neurological, respiratory, inflammatory, dermal, cardiovascular, and neoplastic disorders. For instance, ivermectin targets both DNA and RNA viruses, inhibits angiogenesis, and has anti-cancer properties, which result from inhibiting RNA helicase, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy, as well as promoting oxidative stress. While the precise neurological impacts of ivermectin are not fully understood, it also has anticonvulsant properties in rats. Recent discoveries have revealed the neuroprotective effects of ivermectin in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and Alzheimer’s disease. Although there is limited research on the influence of ivermectin on the cardiovascular system, some studies have reported cardioprotective effects of ivermectin. However, a recent study suggested that ivermectin pre-treatment may have detrimental effects on myocardial ischemia. Consequently, numerous questions regarding the therapeutic/adverse effects of ivermectin remain unanswered and necessitate further investigation. We review the effects of ivermectin in non-parasitic diseases with an emphasis on current research in this field.

Abstract: Hypomimia, or facial masking, is a prominent symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), impacting up to 90% of patients and reducing their quality of life by impairing facial expressivity. Detecting hypomimia is challenging due to its subtle onset and the limited availability of robust diagnostic tools for automatic analysis. To address these gaps, we propose a novel approach based on cheek surface variability, which captures subtle, progressive changes in cheek movement across different temporal granularities within video frames. To evaluate the effectiveness of our cheek marker approach, we also implemented and compared machine learning techniques based on geometric and surface features, and a deep learning approach using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) to capture the temporal dynamics of facial movements. Additionally, this methodology includes a robust pre-processing pipeline to mitigate head rotation and posture biases, ensuring a consistent frontal face orientation throughout the analysis. Video samples of spontaneous speech were collected from 112 de novo, drug naive PD patients and 90 healthy control (HC) subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed cheek surface variability approach outperformed both the machine learning and deep learning models, achieving an unweighted averaged recall of 80.6% and emphasizing its effectiveness in distinguishing PD patients from HC subjects. This work highlights the importance of integrating temporal dynamics into hypomimia modeling and presents cheek variability as a valuable biomarker that enhances classification accuracy. It offers promising implications for more precise monitoring and diagnosis of PD.

Abstract: Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with an insidious onset, and effective therapeutic agents are urgently needed.
Objective
This study employed a multi-omics integration strategy for drug repurposing against AD.
Methods
Firstly, transcriptomic and proteomic data from AD patients were utilized to identify differentially expressed genes. Potential anti-AD small-molecule compounds were screened by integrating the Reverse Gene Expression Score (RGES) and Connectivity Map (C-Map) approaches with drug-perturbed gene expression profiles from the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), followed by blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability prediction and structural similarity analysis. Secondly, a drug-disease network was constructed, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The therapeutic potential of candidate drugs was further evaluated via network proximity analysis. Finally, in vitro validation was conducted using Okadaic acid (OA) induced SH-SY5Y and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced BV2 cell models to assess cell viability and nitric oxide (NO) levels. This integrated approach provides a novel framework for identifying repurposed drugs with potential efficacy against AD.
Results
Following the collection of omics data, 227 overlapping candidate compounds were identified through two computational approaches. After BBB prediction screening, 104 drugs were selected for subsequent structural similarity analysis and literature/patent review, ultimately leading to the selection of TNP-470 and Terreic acid for validation. Network pharmacology analysis revealed that potential targets of TNP-470 for AD treatment were significantly enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, TNF signaling, and AD-related pathways, while anti-AD targets of Terreic acid primarily involved calcium signaling, AD pathway, and cAMP signaling. Network proximity analysis demonstrated significant associations between both candidates and AD. In vitro assays demonstrated that TNP-470 significantly enhanced the viability of OA-induced SH-SY5Y cells at concentrations of 10 μM and 50 μM (p < 0.01 and p < 0.005, respectively). Additionally, within the concentration range of 0.016–10 μM, TNP-470 markedly inhibited NO production in the LPS-induced BV2 microglial cell model. Terreic acid also promoted the survival of OA-treated SH-SY5Y cells at concentrations ranging from 2 to 50 μM, and significantly reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels at a concentration of 10 μM.
Conclusion
This drug repositioning strategy based on multi-omics integration provides a novel approach for AD therapeutic development, with both TNP-470 and Terreic acid demonstrating anti-AD potential.

Abstract: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is essential for neuronal development and synaptic function when activated by its physiological cofactors p35 and p39. Pathological calpain cleavage of p35 generates the more stable fragment p25, producing a hyperactive, mislocalized kinase complex that has been implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation, DNA damage, neuroinflammation, and aberrant neuronal cell-cycle re-entry. Three decades of work position the Cdk5–p25 axis as a convergent pathogenic mechanism in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and in subsets of metabolic and solid-tumor contexts. High-resolution structures of Cdk5–p25 reveal a distinctive activation-loop “cradle” and a tract leading toward catalytic Lys33 that enable structure-guided inhibitor design. Recent advances include (i) small molecules that “vector” toward Lys33 and achieve ∼70–125 × selectivity over closely related CDKs in biochemical assays, (ii) brain-penetrant peptide disruptors that preferentially inhibit Cdk5–p25 while sparing basal Cdk5–p35 signaling in rodent models, and (iii) early-stage degradation or genetic approaches (e.g., dual-target PROTACs; calpain-resistant p35 or Cdk5 knockdown) that reduce p25 signaling or Cdk5 levels in cells. Across inducible mouse models, toxin paradigms, and tumor xenografts, interventions that blunt the p25-driven switch ameliorate cognitive deficits, preserve dopaminergic neurons, improve insulin secretion in β-cell models, and slow tumor growth, respectively. Key translational challenges include achieving durable brain exposure, defining the long-term safety of partial kinase suppression, establishing fluid biomarkers for human studies, and anticipating compensatory signaling. Multiple mechanistic classes are in preclinical development, placing precise disruption of Cdk5–p25 on a credible path toward clinical testing across neurology, oncology, and metabolic disease.

Abstract: Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases. SDF enhances intestinal barrier integrity and regulates immune function by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and increasing the production of beneficial microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 3-hydroxyoctadecaenoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, and bile acids. Current evidence suggests that SDF holds therapeutic potential in managing chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Despite these promising findings, the mechanisms by which SDF exerts its effects, particularly in distal organs and neuroinflammatory conditions, remain poorly understood. This review explores the mechanistic pathways by which SDF modulates immune regulation and highlights the current challenges and future strategies for optimizing its clinical application in treating inflammatory diseases.

Understanding the difference between the motion of animate and inanimate objects and biological motion perception and interpretation are some of animals’ most essential survival abilities. These abilities have significant implications for everyday functioning, adaptive social behavior, and nonverbal communication.
Aim
Our study was designed to answer the following question: Do individuals with significant motor disabilities since birth perceive and interpret the movements of others in the same way as those with typical movement experiences? This question prompts a follow-up inquiry: whether one’s own movement experiences influence biological motion perception.
Methods and procedure
We tested a clinical group of 30 adolescents and young adults aged 14–26 with cerebral palsy and a control group of 30 healthy individuals of the same age. The qualification criteria were normal intellectual development, implementation of a typical educational program, and no significant sensory or speech impairments. We used 11 films from the Communicative Interaction Database, employing the point-light method conventionally used for studying biological motion perception. The recognition of the movement character of the presented non-communicative (NC) figures and the interpretations of the communicative gestures (CG) were assessed.
Results
Participants with cerebral palsy achieved significantly worse results in the biological movement interpretation task. Particular difficulties in the clinical group concerned the interpretation of communicative gestures.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that individuals’ own movement experiences may play a crucial role in the development of biological movement perception. Individuals with motor disabilities may struggle with interpreting observed movements and nonverbal messages, potentially affecting their social functioning.

Abstract: A gold nanoparticle/graphitic carbon nitride heterostructure nanocomposite was synthesized via an in-situ chemical reduction of Au3+ on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride and was applied for the non-invasive electrochemical detection of uric acid (UA) in human saliva. In this configuration, gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) acted as highly active electrocatalytic sites, while graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) served as a high-surface-area scaffold facilitating uniform nanoparticles dispersion and efficient electron transfer. Morphological and elemental characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), BET analysis, and infrared spectroscopy (IR) confirmed the homogeneous distribution of Au-NPs anchored to the g-C3N4 sheets. Furthermore, electrochemical characterization was performed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that Au-NPs@g-C3N4/CPE generated significantly higher UA oxidation peak currents compared with bare CPE. Under optimized pH conditions, accumulation potential, and differential pulse parameters the sensor exhibited a well-defined linear calibration range 0.5–10.0 μM (r = 0.9943) with a detection limit of 0.31 μM uric acid. Selectivity tests in artificial saliva showed negligible signal deviations (≤ ±2 %) in the presence of common salivary interferents such as ascorbic acid, creatinine, and glucose. Spike and recovery experiments using actual saliva samples achieved recoveries of 95.56-98.27 % confirming high analytical accuracy in complex biological matrices. Furthermore, the electrode retained over 90 % of its initial response after 60 days of ambient storage indicating excellent stability. The synergistic integration of Au-NPs with g-C3N4 significantly enhanced catalytic activity, electron transport, and UA adsorption making the Au-NPs@g-C3N4/CPE a cost-effective, sensitive, and reliable platform for point-of-care UA monitoring in saliva for clinical diagnostics and health applications.

Abstract: The recent trend towards sustainable production and consumption contributes to the development of the remanufacturing industry worldwide. Despite the growing number of independent remanufacturers, remanufacturing is practiced by a limited number of European original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). There is a gap in OEM knowledge on remanufacturing as well as a lack of successful cases of OEMs adopting remanufacturing. Yet, the remanufacturing research focuses on why instead of how to adopt remanufacturing. As a result, many OEMs willing to adopt remanufacturing find themselves lost in numerous challenges. The aim of this paper is to identify OEM challenges when adopting remanufacturing and develop recommendations on how to turn challenges into opportunities. To achieve this aim, we utilize literature review and case study research methodologies. In the literature, we identified 12 clusters of challenges on OEM micro- and meso-levels and verified those at eight case companies. We then outlined the recommendations for OEMs on how to turn challenges into opportunities.

Abstract: The prominence of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing exponentially, yet its implementation across research domains is uneven. To quantify AI trends in vision science, we evaluated over 100,000 PubMed article metadata spanning 35 years. Using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, we analyzed trends across four prominent ocular diseases: age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract. Most articles utilized research techniques from at least one of the following domains: biological models, molecular profiling, image-based analysis, and clinical outcomes. Our quantification reveals that AI prominence is disproportionally concentrated in the image-based analysis domain, and, additionally, among 4 diseases evaluated, AI prevalence in cataract research is lagging. Contributing factors towards these disparities include insufficient data standardization, complex data structures, limited data availability, unresolved ethical concerns, and not gaining meaningful improvements over human-based interpretations. By mapping where AI thrives and where it lags, we offer a quantitative reference for funding agencies, clinicians, and vision scientists. Connecting various research domains with multimodal and generative AI could improve diagnostic utility; enabling earlier diagnosis, personalized therapy, reduced healthcare costs, and accelerate innovation. Future work should move AI in vision science beyond image-centric pattern recognition toward integrative, mechanistic analyses that explain – rather than merely detect – disease.

Abstract: Objectives
To assess the validity and reliability of the Six-Spot Step Test (SSST) in total hip arthroplasty (THA) patients.
Design
Cross-sectional cohort study.
Setting
Outpatient clinic.
Participants
Sixty-one patients at least six months post-primary THA.
Main outcome measures
The SSST was performed twice on the same day by Rater 1, along with the Timed Up and Go (TUG), Four-Square Step Test (FSST), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). It was repeated 5–7 days later by Raters 1 and 2. Reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland–Altman analysis; validity with Spearman’s correlation. A fall-risk cut-off was identified via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
Results
Participants’ mean (SD) age was 64 (7) years, with an Oxford Hip Score of 37 (8). As defined by the Bland & Altman analysis, the agreement intervals, within which 95% of the differences of the second measurement, compared to the first one, fall were: within day −1.7 to 2.3seconds (s), −2.3 to 2.0s between day and −2.0 to 1.9 between raters. Reliability was excellent within-day (ICC: 0.95), between-day (ICC: 0.94), and inter-rater (ICC: 0.95). The SSST correlated strongly with the TUG (ρ = 0.70) and FSST (ρ = 0.81), and moderately with the BBS (ρ = −0.62). A cut-off of 10.7seconds indicated fall risk (sensitivity: 75%; specificity: 73%; AUC = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71–0.94, p < 0.001).
Conclusion
The SSST is a reliable and valid tool for assessing mobility in THA patients. It effectively identifies fall risk, supporting its clinical use
Clinical Trial Registration number
NCT06704217
Contribution of paper
•The SSST is a reliable and valid tool for assessing functional mobility in patients after total hip arthroplasty.•A variation exceeding the 95% limits of agreement (−2.3 to 2.0seconds) can be considered a true performance change. •SSST effectively identified fall risk in this sample, with a cutoff time of 10.7seconds.•Strong correlations with established balance and mobility tests support SSST’s clinical utility.

Abstract: Investigating tribological mechanisms in human locomotion aids the early detection of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. A comparative study involving abnormal and normal gait group revealed that abnormal gait was associated with increased Fx forces at peak, reduced Fy and Fz forces at peak in contact forces, and lower required coefficient of friction (RCOF). The reduction of the vertical contact force leads to an insufficient coefficient of dynamic friction, resulting in a compensatory balance. Male patients exhibited higher asymmetry in contact forces, while female required elevated RCOF. Contact forces and RCOF analysis under varied walking conditions identified 23 distinguishing features between PD patients and 12 gender-specific features among patients. These findings may facilitate to improve balance and gait dysfunction in individuals with abnormal gait.

Abstract: With the intensification of global aging, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease present a growing challenge, severely impacting patients' quality of life. Current treatments primarily offer symptomatic relief with limited efficacy and notable side effects, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Oligosaccharides, low-molecular-weight carbohydrates derived from polysaccharide hydrolysis or synthesis, have emerged as promising multifunctional agents due to their diverse bioactivities. They exhibit unique advantages over conventional drugs by simultaneously targeting multiple pathological mechanisms: modulating gut-brain axis communication, suppressing neuroinflammation, enhancing autophagy, and inhibiting toxic protein aggregation. Their neuroprotective effects are strongly influenced by structural features, including glycosidic bond types, molecular size, and functional modifications, which collectively determine their biological activity and specificity. This review summarizes the therapeutic applications of oligosaccharides in NDs, elucidates their multifaceted mechanisms of action, and explores the key structure-activity relationships, providing a foundation for developing oligosaccharide-based interventions with disease-modifying potential for neurodegenerative pathologies.

Abstract: Glucocorticoids (GCs), as commonly used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, may induce neurotoxicity with long-term use, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear. This study utilized zebrafish as a model to investigate the mechanisms and potential intervention targets of hydrocortisone (HC)-induced neurotoxicity. Transcriptome analysis revealed that HC exposure significantly downregulated the expression of Atp2a2 (encoding the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump SERCA2). Functional experiments confirmed that HC disrupts cellular calcium homeostasis: endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ levels decreased, mitochondrial Ca²⁺ accumulation occurred, accompanied by mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and cell apoptosis. Additionally, fluorescent signals in brain and spinal cord neurons were weakened, and significant decreases in movement distance, time, and average speed were observed. Intervention experiments with the GR antagonist RU486 and the SERCA2 activator demonstrated that both could partially restore calcium homeostasis, reduce ROS and apoptosis, and improve motor behavior. The findings revealed that HC disrupted calcium homeostasis by downregulating Atp2a2, activating endoplasmic reticulum stress, and triggering mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to neuronal damage and behavioral abnormalities. SERCA2 may serve as a potential target for alleviating GC-associated neurotoxicity, and this study provides experimental evidence for elucidating its mechanisms.

Abstract: The growing aging population is increasing the demand for long-term care, particularly in nursing homes, where residents are exposed to a convergence of challenges such as immunosenescence, frailty, multimorbidity, and dietary and environmental constraints. These interrelated factors contribute to gut microbiota alterations, underscoring the need for tailored strategies to preserve health and resilience in long-term care settings. Despite its recognized relevance for healthy aging, the gut microbiome of institutionalized older adults remains markedly understudied. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current evidence on the interplay between diet, gut microbiota, and aging in nursing-home residents. Available literature suggests that both aging itself and institutional living contribute to a less favorable microbiome profile. Several contributing factors—many of them dietary—have been identified. Altered gastrointestinal physiology, malnutrition, and common conditions in residential care, such as functional or cognitive impairments, frequently lead to changes in food intake that affect the gut ecosystem. Additionally, immune system decline, increased infection risk, sarcopenia, cognitive deterioration, and high medication burden have also been linked to microbiota disruptions in this population. Importantly, several modifiable features of institutional care—particularly related to diet and lifestyle—may help counteract these effects by supporting gut health. We further examine how appropriate nutritional strategies can positively influence gut microbiota composition and function, offering a pathway to promote resilience and functionality, even in the presence of geriatric syndromes. Beyond identifying these challenges, the review outlines feasible, microbiota-informed strategies to improve quality of life and health outcomes. These include individualized dietary adaptations, targeted supplementation, physical activity interventions, and the integration of digital and artificial intelligence tools to support personalized nutrition. Finally, we highlight the need for standardized protocols and implementation science frameworks to enhance clinical translation—advancing an integrative and still underrepresented perspective on microbiota-based strategies to promote healthier aging trajectories in institutionalized older adults.
Statement of Significance
This review is the first to comprehensively integrate diet–microbiota interactions within the context of institutionalized older adults, synthesizing geriatric, nutritional, and microbial evidence while proposing feasible, multimodal strategies to enhance resilience and support healthy aging in nursing-home settings.

Abstract: The intricate interplay between brain iron homeostasis and pathological α-Synuclein (αSyn) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is still unclear. αSyn is the primary protein involved in disease progression and promotes cytotoxicity by impairing dopamine synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupts brain iron homeostasis. Iron has further revealed to induce αSyn aggregation however, the exact mechanism of interaction between iron and αSyn is uncertain. Many studies have demonstrated an imbalance of iron homeostasis in PD pathogenesis, including macroautophagy related to αSyn aggregate and accumulated ferritin degradation. Inducible ferritinophagy has been suggested as a possible therapeutic to combat raised ferritin levels and reinstate iron homeostasis however this may lead to increased ferroptosis. Despite limited knowledge of ferritinophagy induced ferroptosis in PD there is a possible link to neurodegeneration. This review aims to summarise the current understanding of the chemical interactions between iron and αSyn and possible binding affinities in biologically relevant models, while further highlighting αSyn's pathological role in neurodegeneration and aberrant iron homeostasis. Developing knowledge surrounding the complex interactions between αSyn and iron in PD will aid in possible therapeutic strategies to combat PD disease progression.

Abstract: Background
Radiation induced lung injury (RILI) is a common complication in patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy. At present, there are no effective early diagnostic biomarkers, and clinical treatment methods are very limited, which poses a huge challenge to the management of cancer patients. Oxidative stress has been recognized as a key mediator of aging and disease. Therefore, this study integrated multiple omics data in mice and advanced bioinformatics and machine learning methods to systematically analyze the molecular features associated with oxidative stress, and screened for clinically relevant biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of RILI. This study aims to provide a timely and practical theoretical basis for the early diagnosis and targeted intervention of RILI.
Method
We implemented a comprehensive approach that integrated both bulk RNA and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, utilizing advanced bioinformatics methodologies. These encompassed techniques aimed at eliminating batch effects to facilitate smooth data integration, executing differential expression analyses, and applying weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Furthermore, we developed a diagnostic model for RILI utilizing random forest and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. We also conducted Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). To evaluate immune cell infiltration, we employed Single-Sample Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) alongside the CIBERSORT algorithm. We then investigated the expression and interactions of module genes across various cell populations utilizing data derived from single-cell RNA sequencing. Ultimately, the expression of module genes in irradiated lung tissues were validate by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Results
Our study identified a total of 286 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among these, we confirmed 61 genes related to oxidative stress (OSRDEGs). We constructed nine co-expression modules, four of which showed a significant association with RILI, encompassing 53 genes from these modules. A diagnostic model with AUC over 0.9 was constructed and further refined to include five key genes: Stk4, Aaas, Ets1, Sesn2, and Kit, which were validated for accuracy through LASSO regression. The model genes were found to be enriched in crucial pathways, particularly the MAPK signaling pathway. A direct relationship between Ets1 and Kit was found, which extended to 20 functionally similar proteins identified through GeneMANIA. Additionally, we noted significant changes in the infiltration patterns of 13 immune cell types, including Activated B cells and Activated CD4 T cells. Sens2 and Kit were found highly expressed in granulocytes and endothelial cells, respectively. In mouse models of RILI, Sesn2 and Aaas were significantly upregulated, whereas Stk4, Ets1, and Kit were downregulated.
Conclusion
Our thorough bioinformatics analysis reveals significant molecular events in RILI, identifying 5 key genes and their related signaling pathways. These insights deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of RILI and suggest a practical and effective approach for treatment and early diagnosis.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has exhibited significant potential in diagnosis and operational efficiency across medical domains. Nevertheless, the opacity of the AI-driven diagnostic models creates a major roadblock to clinical deployment. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques have emerged to improve physician trust and transparency in AI-based predictions by addressing interpretability and explainability. This review aims to explore and analyze recent advancements in XAI techniques applied to the diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Diseases (NDs). Based on their approaches toward interpretability, the included studies were categorized into model-agnostic and model-specific techniques. These interpretability techniques provide deeper insights into the factors influencing clinical diagnoses. The review examines various interpretative methods that enhance the transparency of AI-driven models, ensuring alignment with clinical decision-making. This summary reflects all major findings and critical analysis of the responses to the research questions posed. The next stage of analysis describes how XAI enhances model reliability and eases the clinical decision-making process. This review presents a cross-disease comparative evaluation of XAI techniques applied to major NDs such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS), offering a unified perspective on interpretability across modalities and disorders. This study explores existing approaches, highlights their strengths and limitations, and discusses future research directions in this domain.

Abstract: Summary
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases sharing clinical and pathological features. Both involve complex neuron-glia interactions, but cell-type-specific alterations remain poorly defined. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the frontal cortex from C9orf72-related ALS (with and without FTLD) and sporadic ALS (sALS). Neurons showed prominent changes in mitochondrial function, protein homeostasis, and chromatin remodeling. Comparison with independent datasets from other cortical regions revealed consistent pathway alterations, including upregulation of STMN2 and NEFL across brain regions and subtypes. We further examined dysregulation of alternative polyadenylation (APA), an understudied post-transcriptional mechanism, uncovering cell-type-specific APA patterns. To investigate its regulation, we developed the alternative polyadenylation network (APA-Net), a multi-modal deep learning model integrating transcript sequences and RNA-binding protein (RBP) expression profiles to predict APA. This atlas advances our understanding of ALS/FTLD molecular pathology and provides a valuable resource for future mechanistic studies.

Abstract: Impaired fear extinction is a hallmark feature of stress- and anxiety-related disorders. Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid derived from Epimedium, exhibits neuroprotective effects in various preclinical models, but its role in fear modulation remains unclear. In this study, we examined the impact of ICA on contextual fear extinction in a rat model subjected to foot shock (FS). Proteomic and metabolomic profiling of the hippocampus was conducted using data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics and untargeted metabolomics. ICA treatment significantly enhanced fear extinction in FS-exposed rats. Proteomic analysis identified 175 differentially expressed proteins, with enrichment in platelet activation and extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated pathways. Metabolomic profiling revealed 50 upregulated and 229 downregulated metabolites, highlighting the involvement of the sphingolipid signaling pathway. Among the altered proteins, Myl9, Gp1ba, Parvb, and Prkaca emerged as key candidates implicated in ICA’s effects on fear extinction, with Myl9 and Prkaca levels significantly correlated with freezing behavior. Integrative analysis further linked multiple differential metabolites, including (±)12,13-DiHOME, to Myl9 and Prkaca expression. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ICA’s therapeutic potential for fear-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

Abstract: Summary
The treatment of defective glycosylation in clinical practice has been limited to patients with rare and severe phenotypes associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). Carried by approximately 5% of the human population, the discovery of the highly pleiotropic, missense variant in a manganese transporter ZIP8 has exposed under-appreciated roles for Mn homeostasis and aberrant Mn-dependent glycosyltransferases activity leading to defective N-glycosylation in complex human diseases. Here, we test the hypothesis that aberrant N-glycosylation contributes to the disease pathogenesis of ZIP8 A391T-associated Crohn disease. Analysis of N-glycan branching in intestinal biopsies demonstrates perturbation in active Crohn disease and a genotype-dependent effect characterized by increased truncated N-glycans. A mouse model of ZIP8 391-Thr recapitulates the intestinal glycophenotype of patients carrying ZIP8 variants. Borrowing from therapeutic strategies employed in the treatment of patients with CDGs, oral monosaccharide therapy with N-acetylglucosamine ameliorates the epithelial N-glycan defect, bile acid dyshomeostasis, intestinal permeability, and susceptibility to chemical-induced colitis in a mouse model of ZIP8 391-Thr. Together, these data support ZIP8 391-Thr alters N-glycosylation to contribute to disease pathogenesis, challenging the clinical paradigm that CDGs are limited to patients with rare diseases. Critically, the defect in glycosylation can be targeted with monosaccharide supplementation, providing an opportunity for genotype-driven, personalized medicine.

Abstract: Background
The accurate detection and quantification of elemental content in skin appendages, such as, hair and nails are pivotal in biomedical research, including disease diagnostics, environmental exposure monitoring, and forensic investigations.
Methods
This study evaluates and compares the suitability of different sample treatments and four spectroscopic techniques—Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF), Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence (TXRF), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) for multielemental analysis of these biological tissues. Making use of different Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), the performance of the developed methods was assessed based on their sensitivity, precision, range of detectable elements, and the extent of sample preparation required.
Results
EDXRF method is suited for rapid and non-destructive determination of light elements present at relatively high concentrations – Sulfur (S), Chlorine (Cl), Potassium (K) and Calcium (Ca) – in hair and nail samples. TXRF provides information of most of the elements present in the target samples, including Bromine (Br), but the determination of light element (i.e, Phosphorus (P), S, Cl) is not feasible. Finally, the proposed ICP-OES/ICP-MS method is useful for the determination of major, minor and trace elements, except chlorine.
Conclusion
This comparative study reveals the distinct strengths, range of elements and suitable applications of each technique, providing a valuable framework for selecting appropriate methods based on specific analytical needs.

Abstract: Summary
Identifying regulators for tissue regeneration is fundamental for regenerative biology. While transcription dynamics control planarian regeneration initiation, how protein machinery controls regeneration remains unclear, as transcript levels often fail to predict protein abundance. To address this gap, we performed mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analyses of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, establishing a spectral library covering ∼10,000 proteins, and employed quantitative approaches to measure proteome dynamics during regeneration. Our study identified upregulated ribosomal proteins, which were supported by ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-seq). Combining RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Ribo-seq analyses categorized the increased protein abundance into regulatory modes at transcriptional, translational, and protein stability levels. Functional examination identified 25 proteins essential for planarian regeneration. Troponin T was identified as a regulator of regeneration initiation, showing increased protein abundance before upregulation at transcriptional and translational levels, suggesting a regulation of protein stability. In summary, our study demonstrates previously unexplored ribosome-mediated and transcription-independent protein machinery essential for planarian regeneration initiation.

Abstract: Psychedelics have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in treating various psychiatric disorders; however, their effects on motor function remain poorly understood. This study investigated the impact of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM), a classical phenethylamine psychedelic agent, on gait parameters in C57BL/6J mice using an active gait monitoring system. We found that 0.3–3 mg/kg DOM significantly increased locomotor velocity by enhancing stride frequency and length while reducing stance duration. These effects were accompanied by decreased plantar pressure and more concentrated paw placement patterns. High-dose DOM (10 mg/kg) suppressed voluntary locomotion, which was reversible by 5-HT2C receptor antagonism. Pharmacological studies using subtype-selective serotonin receptor antagonists revealed that DOM's effects on gait parameters were primarily mediated through 5-HT2A receptors. Pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg MDL100907, but not 1 mg/kg SB242084, normalized DOM-induced gait alterations. Moreover, the antagonism of 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptor alone modified baseline gait parameters, suggesting the complex serotonergic regulation of locomotor function. These findings reveal alterations in fine gait parameters following DOM administration, expanding our understanding of the complicated effects of psychedelics.

Abstract: Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a significant complication post-revascularization in acute myocardial infarction, with limited effective clinical interventions. Corilagin, a natural polyphenolic compound, exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in various disease models. However, its effects and mechanisms in myocardial I/R injury remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the specific mechanism by which Corilagin regulates ferroptosis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thereby laying a theoretical groundwork for the development of innovative cardioprotective agents. A myocardial I/R model was established in mice through left anterior descending (LAD) artery ligation, and Corilagin's effectiveness was assessed using echocardiography, biochemical assays, and histopathological analysis. Additionally, an in vitro H/R model with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes was employed to examine ferroptosis-related markers, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. Utilizing network pharmacology and molecular docking analysis, potential targets were identified and subsequently validated through pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K pathway with LY294002. The findings demonstrate that Corilagin exhibited significant cardioprotective effects against I/R injury, as evidenced by reduced myocardial injury markers, decreased infarct size, and improved cardiac function. In vitro studies revealed that Corilagin treatment enhanced cell viability, reduced ROS levels and iron content, and restored mitochondrial membrane potential. Network pharmacology and molecular docking identified PI3K as a crucial target, with subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Notably, PI3K inhibition abolished Corilagin's suppression of ferroptosis, underscoring its pathway-dependent action. Corilagin alleviates myocardial I/R injury by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway to suppress ferroptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic candidate for clinical translation.

Abstract: Summary
In vitro human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived models have been crucial in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment, though knowledge of the earliest stages of brain formation is lacking. Micropatterning of cell populations as they transition from pluripotency through the process of neurulation can produce self-assembled neuroepithelial tissues (NETs) with precise spatiotemporal control, enhancing the fidelity of hPSC models to the early developing human brain and their use in phenotypic assessments. Here, we introduce an accessible, customizable, and scalable method to produce self-assembled NETs using bioprinting to rapidly deposit reproducibly sized extracellular matrix droplets. Matrix addition to the media provides a scaffold that promotes 3D tissue folding, reflecting neural tube development. We demonstrate that these scaffolded NETs (scNETs) exhibit key architectural and biological features of the human brain during normal and abnormal development—notably, hyperproliferation and structural malformations induced by TSC2 deficiency—and provide a robust drug screening tool.

Abstract: Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has emerged as a validated therapeutic target in inflammation-related conditions, particularly in cardiovascular, metabolic, and central nervous system disorders. In this study, we report the rational design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a new class of benzimidazole-based amide derivatives as potent and selective inhibitors of sEH. These compounds were developed by scaffold optimization of BRP-7, a previously reported FLAP inhibitor, through strategic modifications at the C(2) and C(5) positions of the benzimidazole core, guided by SAR insights. Among the synthesized analogs, FP30 (BRP-821) exhibited exceptional sub-nM sEH inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.4 nM), along with excellent metabolic stability in human liver microsomes (t1/2 > 184 min, ER < 0.27) and high solubility in simulated intestinal fluid (108 μM). Notably, the lead compounds demonstrated high selectivity over FLAP, distinguishing this new chemotype from dual inhibitors. Collectively, these findings highlight a promising new scaffold for further optimization toward the development of sEH-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of neuropathic pain and inflammatory diseases.

Abstract: Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a series of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by pathological accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Since the abnormal modification and deposition of tau in nerve cells are crucial for tauopathy etiology, methods for reducing tau levels, such as promoting tau degradation, may become effective strategies for disease treatment. Herein, we identified that sorafenib significantly reduced total tau and phosphorylated tau levels through screening FDA-approved drugs. We showed that sorafenib treatment attenuated cognitive deficits and tau pathologies in PS19 tauopathy model mice. Mechanistically, we found that sorafenib inhibited multiple kinases involved in tau phosphorylation and promoted autophagy. Importantly, we further demonstrated that sorafenib also promoted the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7, which could bind tau and mediate tau degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Finally, we showed that FBXW7 expression decreased in the brains of AD patients and tauopathy model mice, and that overexpression of FBXW7 in the hippocampus attenuated cognitive deficits and tau pathologies in PS19 mice. These results suggest that sorafenib may be a promising treatment option for tauopathies by promoting tau degradation and reducing tau phosphorylation, and that targeting FBXW7 could also serve as an alternative therapeutic strategy for tauopathies.

Abstract: Microglia play a significant role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These brain-resident immune cells efficiently clear neurotoxic amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides; however, chronic activation may overwhelm their protective abilities, resulting in persistent neuroinflammation. The causes of aberrant microglial activation in AD remain elusive. Emerging evidence indicates that copper (Cu) accumulation, which can arise from prolonged exposure to various environmental sources, modifies the innate immune response in AD. Here, we sought to explore the mechanisms by which Cu overload regulates the microglial phenotype when exposed to Aβ. Our findings showed that exposure to sublethal doses of Cu led to the accumulation of this transition metal in the mitochondria. Elevated mitochondrial Cu (mtCu) levels were accompanied by reduced mitochondrial glutathione (mtGSH) and high oxidative stress, leading to Aβ-induced inflammasome activation through the release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA (ox-mtDNA). Moreover, increased intracellular Cu levels enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and facilitated its transport to mitochondria. The combination of elevated cholesterol and mitochondrial oxidative stress hindered the ability of microglia to phagocytose Aβ effectively. As expected, conditioned medium from Cu-activated microglia reduced neuronal viability. The neurotoxicity caused by Cu-overloaded microglia was prevented by inhibiting inflammasome activation and restoring mtGSH levels. In conclusion, our study outlines a mechanistic pathway by which chronic exposure to environmental Cu may lead to neuroinflammation and Aβ accumulation in AD, underscoring the crucial role of mitochondrial oxidative stress.

Abstract: Abstract:
Soy protein isolate nanofibrils (SPIFs) have unique functional properties but slow fibrillation kinetics. In this study, pulsed electric field (PEF) was explored as a new strategy to overcome it. To be specific, fibril growth kinetic was established using Thioflavin T fluorescence and conversion rate. Multi-spectroscopic techniques coupled with SDS-PAGE were employed to investigate structural changes in soy protein isolate (SPI) before and after PEF treatment, alongside systematic characterization of SPIFs physicochemical properties. Lastly, functional performance was assessed via confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and emulsification activity index. Results showed that when reaching approximately 25 % fibril conversion, PEF pretreatment significantly reduced the water bath time from 8 h (group 8h) to 4 h (group P-4). Detailed evaluations between group P-4 and group 8h revealed that PEF-treated fibrils exhibited higher β-sheet content (42.4 % vs. 38.5 %), lower surface hydrophobicity (∼30 % reduction), smaller fibril diameter (85.8 nm vs. 120.6 nm), and a more flexible, curved morphology under TEM observation. Based on these, a possible mechanism was proposed: (1) PEF accelerates the exposure of hydrophobic protein regions, enhancing hydrophobic interactions that drive fibril aggregation; (2) PEF induces conformational changes, promoting structural ordering and potentially facilitating the formation fibrillar nuclei during the lag phase; (3) PEF loosens protein structures and promotes acid hydrolysis into smaller subunits or polypeptides, resulting in fibrils with more flexible conformations and improved emulsification properties. The findings highlight PEF as an effective physical tool for modulating the formation of protein nanofibrils, providing new opportunities for the design of functional food ingredients.

Abstract: Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are vital metalloenzymes that catalyze the dismutation of superoxide radicals, thereby shielding cells from oxidative damage. Natural SODs have many obstacles to overcome despite their potential for treatment and diagnosis, such as high production costs, instability, and vulnerability to inactivation in harsh environments. With their improved stability, adjustable catalytic activity, and affordability, synthetic SOD nanozymes have become a viable substitute. The redox-active metal centers and substrate-binding microenvironments of natural SODs, which are essential for effective O2•- scavenging, are modeled in the design of these nanozymes. Notwithstanding their benefits, SOD nanozymes still need to be further optimized to overcome drawbacks like complexity of synthesis, catalytic specificity, biocompatibility, and activity enhancement. Customized designs for industrial and biomedical applications are made possible by precise control over nanozymes' properties made possible by advanced fabrication techniques (such as chemical vapor deposition and hydrothermal synthesis). Clarifying catalytic mechanisms, improving synthesis procedures, and creating individualized treatment plans should be the main goals of future research. SOD nanozymes have the potential to completely transform oxidative stress management in industrial, environmental, and medical settings with further development. Finally, the final viewpoint is taken into consideration, along with the difficulties and potential paths for using SOD-mimetic nanozymes in research or business.

Abstract: Summary
Sleep entails profound changes in the brain and body, marked by altered states of consciousness and reduced somatic and autonomic motor activity. Regarding “how” sleep is regulated, whole-brain screening revealed large sleep-control networks spanning the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. We unify diverse experimental evidence under a “motor theory,” in which the sleep-control mechanism is integral to somatic and autonomic motor circuits. Regarding the “why” question, sleep deprivation impairs cognition, emotion, metabolism, and immunity. We propose catecholamine (dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline) inactivation as the fundamental biological process underlying sleep’s numerous benefits. Beyond brain arousal and motor activity, catecholamines regulate metabolism and immunity; their sleep-dependent suppression yields wide-ranging advantages, promoting repair and rejuvenation. Furthermore, catecholaminergic neurons are metabolically vulnerable; their need for rest and recovery may drive homeostatic sleep pressure. Together, the motor theory offers a unifying framework for sleep control, while the catecholamine hypothesis posits a core mechanism mediating sleep’s multifaceted benefits.

Abstract: MXene-based self-powered wearable devices have emerged as a groundbreaking innovation in the biomedical field, offering significant advancements in health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions. This review delves into the unique properties of MXene-based composites, including their excellent electrical conductivity, high mechanical strength, tunable surface chemistry, promising biocompatibility and biodegradability, antibacterial activity, photothermal properties, electrochemical activity, and enzyme-mimicking capabilities, which render them ideal candidates for powering advanced biosensors and other wearable technologies. By capturing energy from body movements or thermal gradients, these devices can operate autonomously, eliminating reliance on external power sources and enhancing user convenience. The integration of MXenes into biosensing applications allows for the continuous and non-invasive monitoring of vital signs and biomarkers, facilitating early detection of diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Additionally, the potential for localized therapeutic applications, such as photothermal therapy, positions MXene-based devices as versatile tools in personalized medicine. Herein, we aim to critically examine the biomedical potentials of MXene-based self-powered wearable devices, focusing on their applications in health monitoring, disease diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions. Additionally, this review focuses on the challenges confronting MXene-based self-powered wearable devices, while also exploring future perspectives and innovations that could enhance their performance and applicability in biomedical fields.

Abstract: This study investigates the co-encapsulation of caffeine (CAF) and saffron extract (SE) using complex coacervation followed by spray drying for the fortification of dark chocolate. The spray drying process was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM), with the inulin (IN) to maltodextrin (MD) ratio (0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1) and inlet air temperature (IAT; 140, 155, 170 °C) as independent variables. The highest encapsulation efficiencies (CAF: 91.5 %; SE: 81.9 %) were achieved at an IN:MD ratio of 0.5:1 and an IAT of 155 °C. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed successful co-encapsulation through physical interactions, enhancing SE stability and reducing degradation during chocolate processing, from 38.7 % (free SE) to 13.7 % (co-encapsulated SE). In vitro release studies demonstrated controlled co-delivery, with an average release of 91 % in simulated intestinal fluid. Fortification with the co-encapsulated powder had minimal impact on the physicochemical, rheological, and sensory properties of chocolate, with no significant changes in Casson yield stress (6.40 Pa), viscosity (2.45 Pa·s), or texture. Sensory evaluation confirmed acceptable consumer perception, although a slight increase in grittiness was noted due to microparticle dispersion. This research highlights co-encapsulation as a promising strategy for integrating bioactive compounds into functional foods, improving stability, bioavailability, and consumer acceptance, while aligning with the principles of Iranian Traditional Medicine.

Abstract: HCN channels are widely expressed in the brain and heart where they contribute to a variety of functions, including pacemakers, control of rhythmic firing, regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. Here, using zebrafish Danio rerio, we describe the brain and heart expression of hcn2b mRNA, the orthologous gene of human HCN2, and show that a loss of function of the hcn2b gene is associated with a slight, though not statistically significant, increase in basal electrical brain activity and fosab expression. We demonstrate that hcn2b mutants increase motor activity during the day-cycle and show social aversion. Our findings provide evidence that lack of Hcn2b channel function affects social behavior, supporting its relevance as a zebrafish model for studying HCN2-related neurological disorders.

Abstract: Accurate cell atlas analysis using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) is highly influenced by RNA quality, with post-mortem interval (PMI) being a major factor. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects induced by PMI is critical for understanding the cellular and molecular disruptions it triggers. Here, we investigated the impact of PMI on cellular composition and gene expression using snRNA-seq of post-mortem mouse brain tissues. Samples were allowed to decay at 25 °C for varying durations prior to sequencing, covering a comprehensive range of RNA integrity number (RIN) values. Our results revealed that mRNA is more stable than rRNA during decay. Notably, we observed a preferential and transient depletion of oligodendrocytes and OPCs with increasing PMI. In parallel, a rapid and widespread upregulation of ribosomal protein (RP) genes occurred across various cell types, reaching a plateau at approximately 36 h PMI. Although overt loss of neuronal cell states was not detected, we observed significant upregulation of PMI-dependent RP genes, accompanied by a reduction in subpopulation cells. RP genes exhibited the most prominent differential expression in subpopulations experiencing greater perturbations, suggesting that their dysregulation may be linked to cell death. Through this work, we systematically characterized PMI-induced transcriptomic alterations in brain tissue at single-cell resolution and identified key factors contributing to these changes. Our findings offer new insights into the molecular consequences of postmortem hypoxia-ischemia and provide a valuable reference for transcriptomic analyses of RNA-degraded samples.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by drastically reduced synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, possibly due to abnormal α-synuclein deposition. Boosting endogenous neurogenesis is a potential strategy for halting cell death and restoring brain function. AdipoRon (AR) has been shown to promote progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in neurological disorders. This study investigated the effect of intranasal (IN) AR on neurogenesis in the nigrostriatal pathway and motor function in a rat PD model. Dopaminergic neuronal degeneration was induced by administering 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the left medial forebrain bundle. One week post-PD induction, hemiparkinsonian rats received either levodopa (10 mg/kg, gavage) or AR (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/rat, IN) for 21 days. To evaluate adult neurogenesis, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected for 5 days at the start of treatments. Motor functions were assessed 5 weeks post-6-OHDA injection, and the animals were sacrificed for analysis. The number of BrdU and NeuN/BrdU positive cells in the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN) was determined. Moreover, the density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers and the level of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), Zif-268, and synaptophysin (SYP) proteins were examined in the striatum. Our findings indicated that AR dose-dependently restored motor function and increased striatal CDNF, SYP, and Zif-268 protein expression in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Besides, AR 10 μg enhanced the number of NeuN + cells in the SN and dopaminergic fiber density (TH + terminals) in the striatum. These findings indicated that AR improved motor symptoms by promoting neurogenesis and synaptic transmission in the nigrostriatal pathway in PD rats.

Abstract: The present study investigates the toxic impact of two most widely used organophosphates (OP) pesticides namely chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diazinon (DZN) and their metabolites viz. 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), and 2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinol (IMP) on the enzymatic activity and binding affinity of trypsin (TRP) by a comprehensive integration of in vitro techniques, including solution-state 1H NMR chemical shift change in combination with saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR, fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular docking. The enzymatic activity of trypsin in the presence of OP and its metabolites was assessed using 1H NMR chemical shift experiments. The results indicate a notable 56% increase in TRP activity at 500 µM for CPF, while DZN led to a reduction of the same approximately 67% at the same concentration. On the other hand, the OP metabolites namely TCPy and IMP resulted in a decrease of TRP activity by 61% and 37%, respectively. These results exhibit a distinct trend of decreased trypsin activity, with an order of TCPy>DZN>>IMP, whereas CPF exhibits an entirely reverse effect. The observed alterations in trypsin activity may arise from conformational changes in the enzyme structure following the addition of ligands. Furthermore, STD NMR reveals that TCPy exhibits the highest binding affinity towards trypsin compared to other ligands. Conversely, the remaining OP demonstrates similar binding affinities, likely due to structural similarities. The fluorescence results indicate a static quenching mechanism for all OP compounds. Overall, experimental findings indicate that OP metabolites exhibit greater binding affinity towards trypsin compared to their parent compounds. The present study provides valuable insights into the toxicological impact of both parent OP and their metabolites on digestive enzymes.

Abstract: Multiplex biosensors are critical tools for disease diagnosis, as they enable the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers, providing a comprehensive assessment of complex conditions such as sepsis, where the involvement of multiple biomarkers and non-specific symptoms poses challenges to conventional diagnostics. This study presents the design and fabrication of a multiplexed microfluidic aptasensor using porous silicon (PSi) thin films as optical transducers in reflectometric interference Fourier transform spectroscopy (RIFTS). The platform targets three key sepsis biomarkers: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Detection relies on real-time monitoring of refractive index changes in the PSi layer, induced by biomarker binding to immobilized aptamers within the nanostructure. The manipulated channels design ensured uniform flow velocity across the biosensor zones, enhancing uniform conditions for testing in three microchannels. A microcontroller-programmed motorized XYZ translation stage enabled automated, precise, and simultaneous real-time monitoring at multiple reading points. The microfluidic aptasensor platform for detecting three sepsis biomarkers demonstrated signal variations below 7 % between individual and mixture modes, with not significant cross-reactivity, confirming selective and multiplex performance. This work advances the development of label-free, multiplex biosensing platforms, highlighting their potential for clinical diagnostics and broader applications in diverse fields.

Abstract: Mental disorders represent a significant global health challenge, with a high prevalence and substantial impact on individual well-being. Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and various mood disorders, contribute significantly to the burden of neurological conditions worldwide. Identifying novel drug targets and exploring natural product-based molecules have become essential priorities in advancing treatment strategies for these complex diseases. Nanoencapsulation technology has emerged as a valuable tool to increase the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of natural products, thus improving their efficacy in treating neurological disorders. By encapsulating natural compounds such as ferulic acid (FA) in nanoscale delivery systems, researchers have aimed to overcome challenges related to poor solubility and bioavailability, ultimately enhancing therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we examine recent advancements focused on the therapeutic potential of FA in AD, PD, MS, brain cancer, depression (DP), anxiety (AX), and epilepsy (EP). Furthermore, we explored the use of nanoscale delivery systems to optimise the delivery of FA for improved treatment efficacy. We aim to inspire discoveries and innovative approaches to address neurological diseases by highlighting current progress and future directions in this field with FA.

Abstract: Creatine contributes to cognition and brain health in mammalian. Neuronal regeneration in the teleost brain shows great potential throughout the life cycle, dietary creatine may be of potential value in aquatic animal brains. Therefore, in this study, 6 feeds with different creatine additions (0 %, 0.2 %, 0.5 %, 1 %, 2 %, and 4 %) were formulated and fed to juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) for 8 weeks. The brain creatine metabolism of largemouth bass was detected by Q-PCR, Western blot, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Dietary creatine significantly increased creatine inventory, mRNA levels of brain-type creatine kinase, protein level of creatine transporter protein (SLC6A8) in the brain of largemouth bass. This indicated that exogenous creatine can effectively pass through the blood-brain barrier of largemouth bass and deposited in the brain. Western blot for relative quantification of protein levels, it was found in this study that creatine could elevate the protein levels of BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor) as well as phosphorylated activation of the AKT (Protein Kinase B) /mTOR (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Kinase) and the ERK (Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase)/p90RSK (90 KDa Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase) in the largemouth bass brain to activate brain neurotrophin signaling pathways. Teleost can consistently produce new neurons in the adult brain. In this study, dietary creatine significantly upregulated neuro-related growth factors genes, indicating that dietary creatine promotes neurodevelopment and neurogenesis in the brain. In the present study, multiple experimental setups were used to assess fish behavior. Dietary creatine significantly increased the forward maximum acceleration of largemouth bass in open-field test; significantly increased the exploration time in new object recognition test (NORT); and significantly increased the mean swimming speed and forward maximum acceleration of largemouth bass in sociability test. In locomotor (swimming) capacity tests, the burst swimming speed after rest was significantly elevated, which possibly resulting in enhanced predation ability. Overall, these findings suggest that long-term dietary creatine promotes largemouth bass brain health and neurodevelopment, enhance cognitive, and motor performance. In the future, creatine may have multiple potential applications in aquaculture, such as enhancing the adaptability of stock enhancement fish after returning to nature, strengthening cognitive and motor abilities thereby increasing the economic benefits of fish rearing and aquaculture production.

Abstract: Neuronal synchronization plays a pivotal role in higher brain functions. However, in memristive Chialvo neural networks, research on the relationship between neuronal synchronization and network topology is still limited. In this paper, we design a discrete memristive Chialvo small-world neural network (DMCSN) by employing discrete memristors to couple Chialvo models. This study focuses on investigating the effects of topological structure and coupling gain on network synchronization. The topological structure is modulated through two key parameters: the rewiring probability and the number of nearest neurons. Increasing both the rewiring probability and the number of nearest neurons effectively enhances the DMCSN’s synchronization performance. The synchronization factors generally increase with enhanced coupling gain, indicating improved network synchronization. Moreover, under appropriate network topology and coupling gain, both the phase synchronization factor and the complete synchronization factor reach 1, indicating that the DMCSN achieves complete synchronization. Comparative analysis indicates that under identical firing modes, DMCSNs achieve better synchronization properties relative to discrete memristive Chialvo regular neural networks (DMCRNs). These findings advance our understanding of cognitive functions in the brain and provide novel perspectives into the pathological mechanisms of certain neurological disorders.

Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are integral to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) but remain highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, such as malicious attacks and position falsification. Detection is hindered by high-dimensional traffic data and severe class imbalance. Existing intrusion detection methods often overlook feature importance, limiting adaptability to different attack types. This study proposes an adaptive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrating SHAP-based feature selection with a MASV-weighted SMOTE technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to leverage SHAP values not only for feature selection but also to guide class rebalancing during synthetic sample generation. Unlike conventional approaches, which treat all features equally, our method prioritizes features based on their Mean Absolute SHAP Values (MASV) in both selection and oversampling. Evaluated on CICIDS-2017 and validated on VeReMi, the framework demonstrates strong generalizability between datasets. It reduces feature dimensionality by up to 80% (78 to 15 features) while maintaining 99.91% accuracy, achieving up to 50.79% faster training and real-time inference below 0.1 ms per instance. MASV-weighted SMOTE transforms minority class detection performance, elevating the Infiltration attack F1-score from 0 to 88.89% and PR-AUC from 4.43% to 100%. These results outperform baseline models, enabling accurate, efficient, and interpretable IDS for VANETs security applications.
