Abstract: Background
Electrocardiographic (ECG) “left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) criteria” are widely used as surrogates for increased LV mass but show limited sensitivity. We evaluated their diagnostic performance against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in a large population cohort.
Methods
We analyzed 4849 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with standardized digital 12‑lead ECGs and CMR-derived LV mass indexed to body surface area (LVMi). LVH was defined as LVMi >91 g/m2 (men) and > 77 g/m2 (women). We assessed Sokolow-Lyon, Cornell voltage, Cornell product, Peguero–Lo Presti, Sokolow-aVL, and MESA-LVH (SV1 + SV2 + RV5). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for classic (“pre-specified”) thresholds and for cutoffs optimized by the Youden index. We also tested whether combining indices via elastic-net penalized logistic regression improved discrimination.
Results
LVH prevalence was 30.2 %. Across classic thresholds, sensitivities were very low (3.7–15.2 %) with high specificities (>94 %); likelihood ratios were modest (typical LR+ <4; LR− ≈ 0.89–0.96). Youden-optimized cutoffs improved sensitivity (48.9–64.8 %) at the expense of specificity (54.4–74.3 %), yielding weak LR+ (1.42–1.94) and LR− (0.64–0.71). Pooled area under the ROC curve (AUC) for individual indices ranged 0.62–0.66. An elastic-net model combining all indices did not enhance discrimination beyond the best single measure (AUC 0.646).
Conclusions
In MESA, ECG voltage criteria—whether applied at classic or optimized thresholds—show poor diagnostic performance for CMR-defined LVH. Aggregating indices provides no material gain. These findings support reframing voltage positivity as an amplitude-based electrical phenotype with prognostic value rather than a reliable diagnostic surrogate for structural hypertrophy.

Abstract: Oxidative stress occurs when the production of oxidant burden exceeds the body’s ability to counteract them. It is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it damages normal cells and increases the risk of health problems. On the other hand, it can damage cancer cells and bacteria, showing potential in chemotherapy and infection treatment. Tea polyphenols are the main bioactive compounds in tea leaves. They are usually antioxidant, but become pro-oxidant when auto-oxidized or reacted with reduced transition metal ions. In this review, the role of tea polyphenols as antioxidants in preventing neurodegenerative diseases, skin photoaging, atherosclerosis, and cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary injury, as well as the role of tea polyphenols as pro-oxidants in anticancer and antibacterial activities are summarized and elucidated.

Abstract: Oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil (OXA/5-FU)-based hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) represents a promising strategy against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet acquired resistance frequently impedes its efficacy. Here, we identify lactylation of IGF2BP3 at lysine 76 (IGF2BP3-K76lac) as a key driver of HAIC resistance. IGF2BP3-K76lac overexpression enhances chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, lactylation at IGF2BP3 K76 strengthens its affinity for m6A-modified FSP1 mRNA, upregulating FSP1 and conferring ferroptosis resistance. Blocking of IGF2BP3-K76lac bolsters OXA/5-FU-induced ferroptosis, disrupts antioxidant defenses, and curbs tumor growth. Moreover, PARK7 functions as a lactyltransferase to facilitate IGF2BP3-K76lac via increasing the binding of lactate at IGF2BP3-K76 site. Finally, blocking antibody targeting IGF2BP3-K76lac was shown to work synergistically with OXA/5-FU to restore chemosensitivity. Taken together, our findings reveal a critical role for the PARK7–IGF2BP3-K76lac–FSP1 axis in HAIC resistance, highlighting IGF2BP3-K76lac as a potential therapeutic target in HCC.

Abstract: Objective
We propose the Caring Life Course Theory (CLCT) as a lens that can inform and enrich national cancer policy and clinical practice. The purpose of this discussion paper is to highlight how a CLCT lens can inform the implementation of a national cancer control plan, using sections of the Australian Cancer Plan as examples—Optimal Care Pathways and the Australian Comprehensive Cancer Network.
Methods
This discussion paper presents novel suggestions by drawing on CLCT concepts—care biographies, care networks, and self-care. Contrasting “current state” and “future state” vignettes are described to demonstrate how CLCT can help cancer policy move from cancer to care. Based on a robust theoretical lens, recommendations for policy and practice have been made at the micro, meso, and macro levels, with reflection on the nurses’ role, and application to other national cancer control plans.
Results
Optimal care pathways should include holistic assessments that incorporate broader histories at key clinical time points. The Australian Comprehensive Care Network should consider the holistic needs of people affected by cancer, and harness innovative approaches for how these needs can be met in a networked approach. In addition to clinical considerations, understanding of an individual’s care biography, care network, and self-care can inform the delivery of high-quality cancer care. Implementation of these aspects of care will be led by nurses, supported by a multidisciplinary team.
Conclusions
A CLCT lens can help support implementation of the aspirational person-centered objectives described in the ACP. The potential exists for application of the CLCT approach to other national cancer control plans, including those in low-resource settings.
Implications for Nursing Practice
Nurses play a vital role in leading the implementation of person-centered dimensions of cancer control plans and core aspects of the CLCT approach.

Abstract: Abstract:
Background
Foot drop, caused by neurological or muscular disorders, alters ground reaction force (GRF) patterns and impairs gait. Accurate GRF estimation is vital for rehabilitation, but current wearable systems using pressure or inertial sensors face issues of cost, durability, and precision.
Objective
To develop and evaluate a microfluidic channel–based insole integrated with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for GRF prediction relevant to foot drop rehabilitation.
Methods
Three insole configurations—vertical, horizontal, and hybrid—were modeled in Autodesk Inventor (254 × 70 × 5 mm). A synthetic dataset, based on phase-specific GRF values from gait biomechanics literature, was generated using fluid mechanics equations; no human participants were involved. Microchannel parameters (depth, width, pitch, and number) were used as ANN inputs, with GRF as the output. A multilayer perceptron ANN was trained and tested (75/25 split), and performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).
Results
All ANN models achieved strong accuracy (correlation coefficients >0.99). The horizontal design yielded a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.14%, while the hybrid achieved the lowest error (MAPE = 0.077%), capturing both vertical and lateral loads. Regression equations derived from ANN weights enhanced interpretability and supported low-power deployment.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept demonstrates that combining microfluidics with AI enables accurate, non-invasive GRF estimation. The proposed framework offers potential for real-time gait monitoring, detection of abnormal loading, and personalized insole adjustment to support foot drop rehabilitation.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction and iron deposition. Activin A (Act A) is a homodimeric cytokine from the TGF-β superfamily and has neuroprotective effects in various neurological diseases. However, the specific mechanisms by which Act A exerts a neuronal protective effect in PD remain unclear. In this study, we selected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) −induced PD model mice to investigate the mechanism of protective effects of Act A on neurons, focusing on its effects on the expression of mitochondrial dynamics and ferroptosis related proteins. Meanwhile, the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was selected in vitro to detect mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels to clarify the potential molecular mechanism of Act A in PD. The results of the study showed that Act A attenuated dopaminergic neuron damage in the LPS-induced PD model mice, possibly through regulating mitochondrial dynamics, inhibiting ferroptosis, and reducing ROS. Additionally, mitochondrial fusion inhibitor (MFI8) increased the intracellular ROS levels, while Act A attenuated MFI8-mediated ROS elevation. In conclusion, our results suggest that Act A is involved in the onset and development of PD and may exert neuronal protective effects by regulating mitochondrial fusion.

Abstract: ABSTRACT:
Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are a diverse group of disorders characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, leading to severe cognitive and physical impairments. Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington’s diseases are among the most prominent examples, with their prevalence steadily increasing due to the aging global population. In 2009, approximately 50 million people worldwide were affected by ND, and current projections suggest this number will exceed 115 million by 2050. The development of ND is complex and multifactorial, influenced by genetic predispositions, environmental factors, aging, and cellular dysfunction. A significant challenge in addressing these diseases lies in the absence of curative treatments; existing therapies are limited to symptom management and enhancing quality of life. We report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a serie of 2,6,9-trisubstituted purine derivatives, some of which exhibited strong neuroprotective effects in cellular models of mitochondrial (3-nitropropionic acid-induced) and oxidative (glutamate-induced) stress. Also, several compounds functioned as selective butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors and three of which showed CB2 receptor agonist activity, supporting their potential as multifunctional agents for neurodegenerative disorders. In vitro assays confirmed their protective effects across multiple cellular pathways, including reduction of apoptosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial permeability transition. Notably, compound 3e emerged as the most effective derivative, combining strong BChE inhibition, CB2 receptor activation, and cytoprotective effects. These findings identify 2,6,9-trisubstituted purines as promising scaffolds for the development of multi-target-directed ligands in neurodegenerative disease therapy.

Abstract: Contemporary gene therapy approaches represent a promising avenue for intervening in aging mechanisms and treating age-associated diseases. This review analyzes findings from preclinical and clinical studies of gene therapeutic strategies targeting age-related pathologies, including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, and ophthalmological disorders. We examine how specific aging mechanisms — DNA damage accumulation, telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation — can be addressed through targeted gene therapies. Key therapeutic targets include telomerase reactivation through TERT overexpression for genomic stability, KLOTHO supplementation for anti-inflammatory effects, metabolic regulation via SIRT family genes and FoxO3, and protein homeostasis modulation through APOE variants. Additional approaches encompass growth differentiation factors such as GDF11 for tissue regeneration, senolytic strategies for eliminating senescent cells, and epigenetic reprogramming techniques for tissue rejuvenation. Rather than characterizing these as universal ‘longevity genes,’ we emphasize their context-dependent effects, disease-specific applications, and associated benefit-risk profiles. Current methodological limitations and promising directions for developing personalized gene therapy interventions targeting the biological processes underlying aging are discussed.

Abstract: After exposure, toxic metal lead is stored in the skeleton and is mobilized to systemic circulation with bone turnover. Given the bone-conserving properties of estrogen, we investigated whether current use of estrogen-containing contraception is associated with lower blood lead concentrations. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using enrollment data from the Study of Environment, Lifestyle & Fibroids (SELF), a cohort of 1693 Black women ages 23-35 years enrolled in years 2010-2012. The study population was restricted to non-users of injectable hormonal contraception with questionnaire data on hormonal contraceptive use and laboratory data on whole blood lead concentrations (n=1549). The geometric mean blood lead concentrations for current users of estrogen-containing contraception and non-users were 0.41 μg/dl (95% CI: 0.39-0.43) and 0.51 μg/dl (95% CI: 0.50-0.52), respectively. After adjusting for age, education, current smoking status, alcohol consumption, recency of injectable contraceptive hormone use, and recent birth using a multivariable linear regression model to estimate the percent difference in blood lead concentrations, current use of estrogen-containing contraception was associated with an 11% lower blood-lead concentrations (95% CI: -16%, -5%). In exploratory analyses considering contraceptive type, current combined oral contraceptive users (n=187) had 10% lower blood lead concentrations (95% CI: -16%, -4%) and contraceptive vaginal ring/transdermal patch users (n=33) had 18% lower blood lead concentrations (95% CI: -29%, -5%) compared with non-users. Given the known toxic effects of lead and the common use of estrogen-containing contraception, further research is warranted to confirm our observation of lower blood lead concentrations with current use of estrogen-containing contraception.

Abstract: Summary
The rapid and global expansion of stem cell research over the last two decades necessitates coordinated and effective management of information describing stem cell lines and accompanying data resources. Here, we evaluate the maturity of the field by applying FAIR data principles—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—to assess the quality of information describing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in dedicated data infrastructure. We identified a lack of coordination across different jurisdictions that prevents effective information sharing, such as the absence of persistent digital identifiers, inconsistent data standards, and restrictive sharing policies. Using Australia, the United States, Japan, and Europe as case studies, we underscore the need for national infrastructure to support comprehensive cell line cataloging. This is the first systematic evaluation of FAIR principles in the field and indicates that improving metadata standardization and cross-platform coordination will enhance data reuse and strengthen the value of local resources.

Abstract: The evaluation of gait impairments in hemiplegia is an essential aspect of rehabilitation therapy. This study created a gait abnormality evaluation system for hemiplegia utilizing smart insoles to address the limitations of existing clinical observation methods, which are subjective and lack quantitative metrics. This technique measures the correlation between specific gait features and the degree of motor dysfunction while also offering an objective assessment of motor function status. The study comprised 42 stroke patients and 42 healthy controls, with gait data gathered and examined across many parameters. The findings indicated: (1) A significant correlation between lower limb Brunnstrom staging and the Berg Balance Scale, TUGT test, and MBI score (p<0.05); (2) Notable differences in gait spatio-temporal parameters, plantar pressure distribution, and symmetry indices among groups (p<0.05); (3) Principal component analysis (cumulative contribution rate of 94.36%, p<0.05) and the weighted dynamic time warping(WDTW) algorithm confirmed the quantitative relationship between the severity of gait abnormalities and clinical staging; (4) The STC-BiLSTM-MHA model exhibited superior performance in gait abnormality classification tasks (accuracy rate of 74.47%, F1 score of 72.98%), significantly surpassing existing BiGRU models. This study’s gait abnormality assessment method offers an objective and accurate quantitative instrument for evaluating motor function and monitoring therapy in hemiplegic patients.

Abstract: Amyloid deposition of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is closely linked to the pathogenesis and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Developing effective inhibitors to suppress hIAPP aggregation holds significant therapeutic potential for the prevention and treatment of T2DM. Recent researches indicate that both heme and lithospermic acid (LPA) can inhibit hIAPP aggregation. However, heme is prone to induce protein damage under oxidative stress, while LPA exhibits limited inhibitory efficacy despite its antioxidant properties. To overcome these limitations, we aimed to develop a dual-component inhibitor comprising heme and LPA. thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), circular dichroism (CD) and gel electrophoresis were combined to observe the inhibitory efficacy of heme-LPA co-formulation on hIAPP aggregation. The results demonstrate that LPA and heme can synergistically inhibit hIAPP aggregation. The inhibitory effect of heme-LPA co-formulation on hIAPP aggregation is significantly stronger than that of either component alone. The heme-LPA not only prevents the complete conversion of hIAPP into β-sheet fibrillar structures but also maintains its active monomeric conformation for extended periods. Furthermore, peroxidase activity assays revealed that the presence of LPA significantly reduces the peroxidase activity of heme in a concentration-dependent manner and attenuates peptide nitration damage under H₂O₂-NO₂− oxidative stress. At a heme-to-LPA ratio of 1:4, peptide nitration bands were virtually undetectable. These findings indicate that the dual-component inhibitor heme-LPA represents an efficient and safe strategy for inhibiting hIAPP aggregation. This research provides an important avenue for developing novel anti-hIAPP aggregation inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.

Abstract: Chronic manganese (Mn) exposure leads to manganism, a neurological disorder with Parkinson’s disease (PD)-like symptoms. Tamoxifen (TX), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) have both shown neuroprotective effects against Mn neurotoxicity. Since TX, via Wnt signaling, increases REST and protects dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons against Mn toxicity in vitro, we investigated if DAergic REST is essential for TX-induced neuroprotection, with a potential involvement of Wnt, in Mn-exposed male mice. TX pellets were implanted in wild-type (WT) and DAergic REST knockout (REST cKO) male mice prior to Mn exposure (330μg MnCl₂, via nostril instillation) for 3 weeks, followed by behavioral and molecular analyses. The findings revealed that TX attenuated Mn-induced impairments of movement and cognition in WT mice, while those effects were diminished in REST cKO mice. The protein levels in the striatum, where DAergic nerve terminals were situated, showed that TX attenuated Mn-induced reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase and REST proteins, as well as Mn’s neurotoxicity in WT, while these protections on certain proteins were diminished in REST cKO mice. Mn impaired Wnt signaling by dysregulating Wnt3a and β-catenin proteins in WT and REST cKO mice. TX attenuated these Mn effects in WT, with less attenuation in REST cKO mice, suggesting that DAergic REST contributes to TX’s Wnt-mediated neuroprotection against Mn toxicity. These findings demonstrate that TX induces partial protection against Mn-induced toxicity and Wnt signaling disruption in the absence of DAergic REST, but DAergic REST is required for TX-induced full neuroprotection in male mice.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in complex matrices, such as sewage sludge, is an ongoing challenge. To address this issue, a rigorously validated, robust, and efficient method for a wide range of PFAS (48 different species) extraction in sludge was developed. By optimizing liquid-solid ratio (30 mL/g), extracting solvent (methanol ammonia hydroxide (99.5 : 0.5, v/v)), oscillation time (60 min, 300 rpm), and pH of extraction solution (pH = 3) before solid phase extraction, an acceptable recovery (50%-125%) of the majority target PFAS (45 of 48) with low relative standard deviation (≤ 16.84%) was achieved. Compared to currently widely used extraction methods, such as ASTM D2216, a Chinese standard (HJ 1334-2023) and the U.S. EPA method 1633A, the proposed method achieves a 17.3%-27.6% increase in the extracted total PFAS concentration for target analysis. Furthermore, it enables the identification of 3 additional PFAS types, thereby enhancing the scope and accuracy of PFAS analysis. During the investigation of matrix effects, despite the higher organic matter content in anaerobically digested sludge (71.8%) compared to waste activated sludge (46.3%), the matrix effect in the former was significantly lower during PFAS extraction and detection. This result suggests that unstable organic matter in sludge may primarily contribute to the observed matrix effects. Furthermore, reducing the injection volume during mass spectrometry analysis, diluting samples prior to detection, and applying internal standards correction can effectively mitigate matrix effects. When this method was applied to the analysis of different sludge samples (n = 10), all samples exhibited satisfied recoveries of internal standards within the range of 50%-150% except for long-chain 13C2-PFDoA in a sludge sample. Long-chain PFAS, such as PFOA and PFOS, remained the predominant compounds in different sludge. These findings highlight the method’s reliability for complex matrices and its potential for broader environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) regulates extracellular glycine levels and modulates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity, positioning it as a promising target in excitotoxic and ischemic conditions. While previous studies have shown that GlyT1 inhibition prior to injury confers neuroprotection, its therapeutic potential in a post-ischemic context remains unclear. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of NFPS, a selective GlyT1 inhibitor, administered after the induction of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. NFPS (1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered once daily for three days, beginning 24 h post-ischemia. NFPS treatment significantly reduced infarct volume and improved motor function in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, NFPS reduced reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation, alongside adjustments in antioxidant enzymes and glutathione-related activity. Proteomic analysis of cortical tissue from healthy mice treated with NFPS revealed enrichment of pathways related to glutamatergic synapse, Parkinson disease, and dopaminergic synapse pathways, suggesting modulation of synaptic plasticity and metabolic resilience. Western blot analysis confirmed an increase in GluN2A and a decrease in GluN2B expression, consistent with a shift toward prosurvival NMDAR signaling. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that post-ischemic GlyT1 inhibition with NFPS confers robust neuroprotection through coordinated regulation of excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, supporting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Antipsychotic activity of certain 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonists has been attributed to inverse agonism. 5-HT2AR hallucinogenic agonists exhibit biased agonism towards Gi/o proteins. Ketanserin and altanserin are two structurally similar orthosteric drugs used as 5-HT2AR therapeutic and radiotracers tools. This study assessed the pharmacological properties of ketanserin and altanserin, previously described as neutral 5-HT2AR antagonists, using post-mortem human prefrontal cortex. Receptor radioligand binding experiments and functional [35S]GTPγS binding assays followed by immunocapture with anti-Gαq/11 and anti-Gαi1 protein antibodies were performed. Molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to ascertain binding modes to the 5-HT2AR. [3H]Ketanserin binding to 5-HT2ARs was decreased by Gpp(NH)p, a GTP analogue. Gpp(NH)p transformed the biphasic inhibition of [3H]ketanserin binding by the agonist (±)DOI into a monophasic low-affinity curve. Ketanserin stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαq/11 but not Gαi1 proteins. Conversely, altanserin inhibited [35S]GTPγS binding to Gαi1 but not Gαq/11 proteins. These effects were blocked by the neutral antagonist MDL-11,939. Altanserin-induced inhibition was abolished by the Gαi/o alkylating agent NEM. Similar findings were observed in wild-type but disappeared in 5-HT2AR knock-out mice. Ketanserin and altanserin showed distinct interactions within residues S2.61, S5.46 and N6.55 in the 5-HT2AR binding pocket. Therefore, ketanserin and altanserin elicit biased signaling with different patterns of G protein modulation upon interacting with 5-HT2ARs in brain. Ketanserin behaves as partial agonist on Gq/11, whereas altanserin acts as inverse agonist on Gi1 proteins. These findings should influence the design of antipsychotic drugs targeting this receptor and when used as antagonists and radiotracers for the 5-HT2AR assessment.

Abstract: The complex molecular pathways behind liver fibrosis (LF) make the existing antifibrotic therapy unsatisfactory. In this work, entacapone's hepatoprotective activity was examined, along with its impact on the hepatic expression of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) in a rat model of LF. Liver fibrosis was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in a dose of 2 mL/kg orally twice weekly throughout the study. Three groups of thirty male Wistar rats were created: (I) control, (II) LF, and (III) entacapone pretreatment. Liver/body weight index and liver function tests were measured. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and m6A values as well as FTO and SIRT1 gene expression were detected in the liver. Liver histopathology and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) immunohistochemical analysis were assessed. Compared to the LF group, the entacapone-pretreated group showed a decrease in oxidative stress in hepatic tissues and improved hepatic function tests. In comparison to the LF group, this was linked to a decrease in FTO gene expression and an increase in SIRT1 gene expression and the percentage of m6A in total RNA. Additionally, the entacapone-pretreated group decreased the amount of collagen fibers and TGF-β expression, improving the histopathological alterations in the liver. In a rat model of LF, entacapone’s hepatoprotective effect may be attributed to the alteration of the FTO/m6A/SIRT1 signaling pathway. The current study may offer entacapone as a promising approach for liver protection during fibrosis.

Abstract: Predicting external hand load from sensor data is essential for ergonomic exposure assessments, as obtaining this information typically requires direct observation or supplementary data. While machine learning can estimate hand load from posture or force data, we found systematic bias tied to biological sex, with predictive disparities worsening in imbalanced training datasets. To address this, we developed a fair predictive model using a Variational Autoencoder with feature disentanglement, which separates sex-agnostic from sex-specific motion features. This enables predictions based only on sex-agnostic patterns. Our proposed algorithm outperformed conventional machine learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, achieving a mean absolute error of 3.42 and improving fairness metrics like statistical parity and positive and negative residual differences, even when trained on imbalanced sex datasets. These results underscore the importance of fairness-aware algorithms in avoiding health and safety disadvantages for specific worker groups in the workplace.

Abstract: Objectives
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common and serious conditions that affect people’s health. The use of early-stage signs to diagnose cardiovascular disease is a major problem in the modern world. However, there is a need for less expensive tools that detect cardiovascular disease without overbearing procedures.
Methods
In this study, we develop ensemble hybrid and blending techniques for the early detection of cardiovascular disease. Firstly, the proximity weighted random affine shadow sampling is utilized to reduce risk of bias model learning. Next, principal component analysis extracts most relevant features to improve accuracy and computational time. After that, we developed two novel ensemble models: hybrid and blending. A hybrid model combines convolutional neural networks and temporal convolutional networks, while blending model places convolutional neural networks and temporal convolutional networks, and a deep belief network on base layer and highway networks on meta layer to enhance cardiovascular disease detection performance. A combination of 10-fold cross-validation on clinical cardiovascular data showed both ensemble methods surpassing conventional models achieving peak results through the blending approach.
Results
The blending model reaches 0.914 accuracy and 0.9097 F1-score yet the hybrid model shows 0.8496 accuracy with 0.8496 F1-score. The project utilizes Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) through explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques for achieving dependability and transparency. The methods deliver explanations to clinicians by showing how clinical characteristics influence the predicted results.
Conclusion
The proposed ensemble model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities combined with interpretability which allows its use in real-time operations for cardiovascular disease prediction.

Abstract: Neuromelanin (NM) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively new, noninvasive method used as a proxy measure of midbrain dopamine function. Previous studies in schizophrenia have found evidence of enhanced signal in patients that are associated with positive psychotic symptoms. However, there are limited data available comparing methods of computing signal in substantia nigra (SN). We sought to examine the reliability and validity of manual tracing vs template-defined methods to help guide the field in identifying optimal approaches in NM imaging. NM-MRI was performed on 22 participants (18 with early psychosis (EP) and 4 healthy controls (HCs)) scanned twice over a 1–14 week period. Mean SN NM signal was calculated using template-defined and manual tracing methods to define SN ROIs. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) based on absolute agreement were calculated between test and retest. Correlations between NM signal for each method and symptoms in EP were also examined. ICCs for the template-defined were in the excellent range (.81–.85) and manual tracing methods were in the poor to fair range (−.14 to .56). The template-defined method showed a trend positive relationship with reality distortion symptoms (r = .45, p = .06) and the manual tracing method showed a significant positive relationship (r = .47, p = .05). Supplemental analyses highlighted the importance of thresholding and using the mode to compute CNR for identifying these relationships to symptomatology. While both methods showed clinical validity, the excellent reliability of the template-defined method suggests this technique is the preferred strategy for NM-MRI analysis.

Abstract: Psychological resilience is the capacity to withstand and bounce back from stressors, trauma, and negative life events, such as childhood adverse experiences (ACEs). Yet, little is known about the biological mechanisms by which resilience mitigates the psychological effects of ACEs. We aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that reflect the combined effects of early life stress and psychological resilience by using an inflammatory proteomics panel. Three different resilience and ACE questionnaires were employed to classify participants into four groups according to high vs. low levels of resilience and ACEs. In total, 32 age- and sex-matched participants were selected for proteomics profiling with Olink's 92-protein inflammatory panel. Forty-five age-matched and sex-matched participants were selected for proteomics profiling with Olink's 92-protein inflammatory panel. Of these, only 32 passed quality control filtering for analysis. Results showed that CD274 emerged as a protein hub in resilient profiles, while CXCL5 was central to ACE-related profiles. Network co-expression analysis revealed group-specific protein rewiring, suggesting dysregulated inflammation in individuals with high ACE. In contrast, high-resilience profiles showed stronger immune checkpoint co-expression, indicating more effective inflammatory resolution as a key trait of resilience. These findings suggest that resilience maintains an adaptive immune network architecture that may be leveraged to promote resilience after early adversity.

Abstract: Background
Both risperidone and aripiprazole are effective in reducing irritability severity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, head-to-head comparison trials between these two drugs are scarce in the literature and have shown conflicting results.
Methods
This trial compared the efficacy and safety of risperidone and aripiprazole in children and adolescents with ASD, aged 6–18 years. After a two-week placebo trial, placebo responders were excluded. The remaining participants were randomized into two groups. The outcomes were the change in the irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-I), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS2), Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS-R), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), Sensory Profile-2 (SP-2), cognition and the nature and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events.
Results
Seventy-two patients (36 in each group) were recruited. Changes in the ABC-I score (−13.6 ± 4.3 vs. -12.2 ± 3.9, p = 0.15), ABC total score (−27.5 ± 15.9 vs. -26.8 ± 15.7, p = 0.85), CARS score (−2.9 ± 0.7 vs. -2.7 ± 0.8, p = 0.26), CPRS-R Global Index T-score (−10.63 ± 8.54 vs. -9.61 ± 8.92, p = 0.62), number of patients with significant sensory processing abnormalities (18/36 vs. 18/36, p = 1.0), CSHQ score (−4.6 ± 3.8 vs. -3.9 ± 3.1, p = 0.39), and full-scale IQ (1.9 ± 1.6 vs. 1.8 ± 1.5, p = 0.75) were comparable between groups. In multivariate regression analysis, CPRS-R Global Index T-score (p = 0.02) and full-scale intelligence quotient (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of changes in the ABC-I score. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups. Serum prolactin levels decreased in the aripiprazole group at 12 weeks but increased in the risperidone group.
Conclusions
Risperidone and aripiprazole demonstrate comparable efficacy and safety in managing irritability in children and adolescents with ASD. Trial Registry no: Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2021/12/038721).

Abstract: Abstract:
Background
SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19 caused a global pandemic, with billions of infections, millions of deaths and ongoing manifestations post COVID-19. “Long Covid”, a Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), is an ongoing global healthcare problem, affecting all age groups, with many manifestations, and occurring despite vaccines and antivirals. Neurologic manifestations of PASC (Neuro-PASC) such as brain fog can last for years and are amongst the most debilitating and prevalent. There is a need for diagnostic tools and treatments.
Methods
Plasma samples from 48 non-hospitalized PASC patients with diagnosed Neuro-PASC symptoms (NP), 20 convalescent control (CC) subjects, and 24 unvaccinated healthy control (HC) subjects, was used to generate data on over 7,000 proteins using the SomaLogic® proteomics platform. ProViz® software was used to perform T-tests, U-Tests, ANOVA and Kruskalis-Wallis tests at a Bonferroni p<0.05 and a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected False Discovery Rate <0.02, and box plots and knowhow used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
Results
C5a, TGFβ1, and Gliomedin, used together differentiated patients with Neuro-PASC from control subjects with 94% sensitivity and 86% specificity, a 90% accuracy. Additional biomarkers, Gal3ST1, IFNλ1, and GHRH, improved accuracy to 94%, and a combination of 5 more biomarkers, LFA-3, FASLG+Transgelin-1 and GPNMB+IGHG1, improved accuracy close to 100%. These markers are suggestive of pathways involved in Neuro-PASC pathogenesis. A dozen partly overlying biomarkers were modulated to which there are FDA approved drugs.
Conclusion
C5a, TGFβ1, Gliomedin expressed highly in serum could be developed as a diagnostic tool, and with clinical assessment used to personalize treatments with repurposed novel drugs.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. It leads to a range of motor symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait instability. A significant, but often overlooked, sequela of PD is osteoporosis, which contributes to a higher incidence of fractures. This risk is exacerbated by both PD itself as well as the medications used to manage PD. Despite the heightened risk of fragility fractures, osteoporosis in PD is frequently under-recognized and inadequately managed.
Objective
This review aimed to explore the current literature on osteoporosis management strategies specifically for individuals with PD.
Methods
MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched from database inception to August 10, 2025.
Results
Following a two-stage review process conducted by two independent reviewers, 18 relevant articles were identified. Of these, 17 were review articles and one was an interventional study. The literature most commonly identified lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, and surgical interventions as management strategies for osteoporosis in PD. However, most of the recommendations were based on research conducted in the general population, raising concerns about their effectiveness for individuals with PD, who may have unique clinical needs.
Conclusions
We note a significant gap in research focused on osteoporosis management in PD patients. Research efforts should prioritize developing tailored strategies to manage osteoporosis in individuals with PD.

Abstract: Background
Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Psychosis is an uncommon but debilitating psychiatric manifestation in HD. This systematic review synthesizes published case reports to characterize the clinical presentation and management of psychosis in HD.
Methods
We searched the literature for case reports (including small case series) of HD patients with psychosis. Eligible publications (English, 1980–2024) were reviewed, and data on demographics, HD onset, timing of psychosis, family history, psychotic symptomatology, treatments, and outcomes were extracted.
Results
Forty-eight case reports, encompassing 55 HD patients with psychosis. The mean age of psychosis is lower than the mean age of HD diagnosis and motor symptom onset. Psychosis in HD typically presents delusions and hallucinations. Nearly all patients were treated with antipsychotics, predominantly atypical agents; only a few received first-generation antipsychotics. Most patients showed good responses to medication. Common adverse effects of antipsychotics included extrapyramidal symptoms and sedation. Nine reports (13 patients) described the use of ECT for severe or refractory psychosis, with the majority achieving significant reduction in psychotic symptoms and only minimal side effects.
Conclusions
Psychosis in HD can manifest across a wide spectrum of ages and disease stages. Atypical antipsychotics are generally effective for symptom control, and ECT appears to be a safe and effective adjunct for refractory cases. Clinicians should be vigilant for psychosis as a potential early sign of HD and consider a tailored, multidisciplinary treatment approach. Further research is needed to guide management.

Abstract: Summary
The ketogenic diet (KD) is a potential therapeutic strategy for glioma; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we first identify that glioma patients exhibit a distinct gut microbial profile characterized by reduced butyrate-producing bacteria abundance, particularly R. faecis, along with decreased butyrate levels. Notably, KD reshapes the gut microbiota especially enriching A. muciniphila in a mucin-2-dependent manner, elevates butyrate production, and activates caspase-3 in microglia. These changes promote an anti-tumor microglial phenotype, ultimately suppressing glioma progression in mice. Crucially, KD’s anti-glioma effect is notably abolished by antibiotics treatment; germ-free condition; or specific depletion of mucin-2, microglia, or microglial caspase-3. Furthermore, butyrate, A. muciniphila, R. faecis, or A. muciniphila plus R. faecis restores KD-induced microglial caspase-3 activation and the anti-tumor phenotype of microglia in antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice. These findings highlight that targeting the gut microbiota by KD or supplementing with butyrate could be an effective strategy for glioma therapy.

Abstract: Background
Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to motor, sensory and autonomic dysfunction with no effective therapy till now. The malignant microenvironment and glial scars at the injury site impede neural circuit remodeling and functional recovery of SCI. Urolithin B (UB), an intestinal metabolite of ellagitannin, possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor and neuropharmacological activities.
Purpose
To investigate the effects and mechanism of UB in SCI recovery both in vitro and in vivo.
Methods
At the cellular level, the study focused on the effects of UB on H2O2-induced PC12 cells damage and LPS-induced HMC3 cells polarization. At the in vivo level, the repair effect of UB gavage on SCI mice was performed by behavioral analysis, immunofluorescence, histopathology, and ELISA. Finally, network pharmacology, transcriptome sequencing, molecular docking, and reverse validation were conducted to explore the molecular mechanism by which UB promotes SCI repair.
Results
UB protected PC12 cells against H2O2-induce injury and decreased LPS-induced M1-type polarization of HMC3 cells. In addition, UB promoted nerve regeneration, regulated M1/M2 polarization of microglia, and reduced the formation of glial scars, thereby facilitating the motor function recovery of SCI mice. Further studies indicated that UB inhibited the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1β pathway both in vivo and in vitro to reduce neuroinflammation. In contrast, BMS-986299 (an agonist of NLRP3 inflammasome) attenuated the restorative effects of UB in SCI mice.
Conclusion
UB inhibits the NLRP3/Caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway and M1 polarization of microglia to attenuate neuroinflammation and promote the functional recovery of SCI mice. Therefore, UB may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of SCI.

Abstract: Summary
Integrating exercise prescriptions with medication management represents a novel approach for enhancing health and function, optimising medication effectiveness, and reducing adverse drug reactions and polypharmacy in older adults (ie, those aged ≥60 years). This Personal View highlights the need for a comprehensive assessment of lifestyle, diagnoses, geriatric syndromes, and medications with an emphasis on fully incorporating exercise treatment into geriatric care. Exercise is an alternative to less effective or unsafe medications for many conditions, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, osteoarthritis, and dementia. Exercise is an important adjunct to pharmacotherapy for many common chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Adding exercise to drug management can mitigate adverse drug reactions, enhance medication compliance, and reduce the adverse effects of sedentary behaviour and ageing processes on chronic disease expression. Targeted exercise programmes have also been shown to ameliorate drug-induced side-effects, including anorexia, falls, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and orthostatic hypotension, and to overcome constraints such as reduced aerobic fitness, balance impairment, and muscle atrophy due to some medications. Health-care professionals require additional training and support to ensure that exercise assumes a key, central role in older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, as supported by the current literature. This Personal View describes practical approaches to incorporating exercise into clinical practice as a step towards an integrated geriatric care model, with the ultimate aim of increasing health span and minimising disability.

Abstract: The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brainstem nucleus best known for being the primary site of noradrenaline production for the forebrain and is involved in the modulation and optimization of behavioral performance. The LC has many targets throughout the cortex, and ascending projections from the LC join the central tegmental tract (CTT), a well-defined white matter brainstem tract in the pons that terminates in the thalamus. Evidence indicates that the LC is one of the first brain regions to show pathological burden in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and AD patients exhibit structural alterations in the LC and its ascending projections. The extent to which changes occur in the LC and its projections in normal aging, however, is less clear. Analysis of LC-forebrain tractography has historically been difficult due to the small size of the LC as well as the abundance of crossing fibers in the brainstem. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows us to overcome some of these setbacks, as longer scan times can be used to generate higher resolution images than is possible in live subjects. Here, we utilize a cohort of bonnet macaques, an excellent model of normative aging, and analyze the microstructure of the LC and its projections that join the CTT with respect to age. We have been able to overcome issues associated with LC tractography and have found a negative association with age and diffusivity.

Abstract: Background
Intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) plays a critical role in clinical care and neuroscience research, enabling precise mapping of human cortex. However, localizing subdural electrodes in patients with brain tumors presents unique challenges due to altered neuroanatomy and the impracticality of acquiring extraoperative imaging.
New method
To address these gaps, we developed BrainTRACE, a novel MATLAB tool that combines MRI, cortical vascular reconstructions, and intraoperative photography for accurate subdural electrode grid placement. Preoperative MRI, cortical photography, and subdural electrode array data were recorded from patients with diffuse glioma and brain metastasis. BrainTRACE generated 3D cortical surfaces, integrated vascular reconstructions, and enabled precise placement of electrode grids. Each electrode was placed based on cortical anatomy and vascular landmarks informed by intraoperative photographs.
Results
Expert users achieved high consistency and accuracy, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.934 and a mean deviation of 4.3 mm from consensus placements. Novice users demonstrated lower reliability and greater variability, highlighting the non-trivial nature of intraoperative ECoG localization, which requires neuroanatomical expertise.
Comparison with existing methods
To our knowledge, BrainTRACE is the first freely available tool that enables photograph-guided ECoG localization using cortical surface reconstructions and vascular anatomy without relying on post-operative imaging.
Conclusions
BrainTRACE enables accurate localization of intraoperative ECoG electrodes in brain tumor patients. By integrating anatomical images, intraoperative photographs, and vascular mapping, the tool addresses challenges posed by tumor-induced artifacts. BrainTRACE provides a freely available practical tool for neurosurgical and neuroscience applications, including brain malignancy, epilepsy, and deep brain stimulation.

Abstract: Social environments present opportunities for connection and resources, but they also involve the risk of rejection. How do people learn which individuals will reject or accept them upon entering a novel environment? Here, we propose a route to such learning: people use knowledge of relationships in social networks to infer who will be likely to accept or reject them. Previous research shows that people generalize trust from one individual to that individual's friends, yet it remains unclear whether rejection and acceptance experiences generalize in similar ways in social network contexts. We designed a novel experimental paradigm in which participants experienced rejection and acceptance within an artificial group, learned about network connections among group members, and decided which members to approach in a new task. Study 1 found that participants generalized rejection by avoiding individuals socially closer to a rejector and approaching those closer to an accepter, forming a gradient of avoidance and approach based on network distance. Study 2 further demonstrated stronger generalization when networks reflected friendship as opposed to randomly assigned ties, suggesting partner choices depend on explicit inferences about meaningful relationships rather than associative learning alone. Finally, in a longitudinal survey of student groups, Study 3 extended these findings to real-world social networks, revealing similar patterns of generalization in college student organizations. Together, our findings inform the cognitive processes that help humans successfully navigate social environments by adaptively forming new connections.

Abstract: Pyridazine is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound with a six-membered ring containing four carbon and two nitrogen atoms. Studies have demonstrated their multiple pharmacological properties, including anticancer, antiviral, and anti-Parkinson's disease effects. Recently, there has been increasing interest in their potential anti-tumor resistance activity. Several pyridazine-based drugs and their analogs are currently undergoing clinical trials at different stages, suggesting that pyridazine is a promising chemical structure for drug development. Notably, modifications of pyridazine structures significantly affect their anti-tumor resistance activity. This review summarizes current advances in developing pyridazine derivatives as anti-tumor drug, highlighting key SAR-based design optimization strategies, molecular design principles, and mechanistic insights into target binding. These insights could pave the way for the development of more effective anti-tumor agents overcoming resistance.

Abstract: Background
Diquat is a highly toxic pyridine-based herbicide, and its central nervous system (CNS) toxicity is a major factor contributing to the high mortality rate and poor neurological outcomes in poisoned patients. Compared with other organ injuries, the complex molecular mechanisms underlying diquat-induced CNS damage and effective neuroprotective strategies remain poorly understood.
Methods
A systematic search and screening of relevant literature on diquat-induced CNS toxicity were conducted. Based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 articles were selected from 424 retrieved records, including 11 experimental and 10 case studies. A systematic review approach was employed to integrate basic research with clinical evidence.
Results
The study identified typical clinical manifestations of CNS damage caused by diquat poisoning (e.g., impaired consciousness, convulsions, and brainstem symptoms), along with characteristic imaging findings (e.g., lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem). The core findings highlight six major mechanisms underlying diquat-induced neural damage: excessive activation of the oxidative stress response; pronounced neuroinflammatory cascade reactions; dysregulated autophagy function; activation of apoptotic signaling pathways; mitochondrial dysfunction; and significant alterations in the neurotransmitter system. These mechanisms are interrelated and collectively lead to neuronal death and functional impairment.
Conclusions
Diquat induces severe CNS damage through multiple interrelated molecular mechanisms. Current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies face significant challenges in improving neurological outcomes, particularly due to the lack of specific antidotes and targeted neuroprotective agents. Future research should aim to elucidate the underlying mechanisms in detail, explore novel neuroprotective targets, optimize comprehensive treatment protocols, and develop long-term rehabilitation strategies to reduce neurological impairment and mortality associated with diquat poisoning.

Abstract: It is an established fact that depression and stress are prevalent among patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. This cross-sectional study, conducted in 2019 over a period of two months, aimed to assess patients' perceptions of stress and depression before and after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery in Jordan. Data were collected at two time points: pre-operatively following hospital admission and at one-month post-operatively,using the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The paired t-test was used to analyse pre-post differences in depression and stress scales, and correlations were calculated through Spearman's and Pearson's correlation tests as appropriate.The mean PSS pre-test scores. A total of 60 patients participated in the study, with 36 (60%) undergoing scheduled surgery and 24 (40%) undergoing urgent surgery High levels of perceived depression were observed both pre- and post-surgery; however, no statistically significant differences were found between the two periods (t=1.63; p=0.108). However, there was a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress one month after surgery (t= -3.43; p=0.001). The mean PSS pre-test scores showed a statistically significant difference between patients in the scheduled surgery group (M = 21.19, SD = 4.76) and those in the urgent surgery group (M = 17.91, SD = 5.63); t [58] = -2.427, p = 0.018).To mitigate the prevalence and adverse effects of stress and depression among CABG patients, these conditions should be managed prior to surgery. Healthcare professionals are recommended to provide preoperative psychological and emotional support to reduce stress and depression levels. Furthermore, patients should be provided with resources and support services to help them cope with any postoperative issues. This study underscores the importance of preoperative and postoperative care in managing stress and depression among CABG patients.

Abstract: Detecting multiple pesticide residues in water is critical due to their risks to human and environmental health, which necessitates rapid and accurate methods. Given its high toxicity and persistence, accurately monitoring the widely used pesticide Abamectin in water is crucial. For this purpose, this study developed a molecularly imprinted polymer sensor based on magnetic metal-organic frameworks modified with graphene quantum dots (MIP-ZIF67/Fe3O4/GQDs) for the detection and determination of the Abamectin. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analyses were used to characterize this polymer. The detection of abamectin pesticide was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy at different concentrations, and the polymer sensitivity was found to be 29.79 (a.u./ppm). Additionally, the detection limit and quantification limit of the prepared MIP-ZIF67/Fe3O4/GQDs were 160 (ppb) and 500 (ppb), respectively. The sensor demonstrated high specificity for abamectin, with an imprinting factor (IF, α) of 2.52 and a relative selectivity coefficient (, β) ranging from 5.82 to 8.17 against competing pesticides. Overall, a highly sensitive and selective molecularly imprinted polymer sensor (MIP-ZIF67/Fe3O4/GQDs) was developed to detect the toxic pesticide abamectin in water. Under optimal conditions, it achieved a 99.82% trapping efficiency and a high recovery rate of 98.88%, demonstrating excellent stability for environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Targeted modulation of the gut microbiome offers significant promise for preventing and treating diverse diseases; yet, enhancing the efficacy of these interventions remains challenging. Polysaccharides have emerged as potent microbiome modulators, functioning as prebiotics that selectively promote beneficial bacterial growth and metabolite production. Their resistance to gastric degradation and selective intestinal fermentation enhance the precision of microbiome modulation while facilitating direct immunomodulatory interactions via pattern recognition receptor engagement on gut immune cells. Despite their high potential, polysaccharide-based microbiome modulators remain underrecognized. Advances in polysaccharide bioengineering now allow rational design of structure–function relationships, enabling targeted control of microbial communities and host immune responses. This review highlights these developments and applications, providing a timely perspective on next-generation microbiome-targeted strategies.

Abstract: Clean hydrogen provides a pathway to a sustainable energy future. However, current commercial water electrolyzers rely on high purity water, which can add significant stress on local water supply and additional economic burdens. To lessen the reliance on freshwater in electrolytic hydrogen production, alternative water sources such as reclaimed water (RW) from wastewater treatment facilities could be used. However, little is known how various water impurities in such source water impact the system performance and longevity. In this study, we characterized such impacts in lab-scale water electrolysis systems, and the results revealed that RW impurities primarily affected the membrane through contamination by cations. By acidifying the RW feedstock, we successfully extended electrolyzer stability from 8 hours to over 300 hours at a current density of 150 mA cm-2. Furthermore, this acidification step reduced cost by 46.9% and energy intensity by 61.8% via the elimination of multi-stage RW pre-treatment. This work highlights the practical feasibility of reclaimed water electrolysis, enabling wastewater facilities to contribute to the broader integration of clean energy transition.

Abstract: Abstract:
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a powerful technique for assessing macromolecular structure. High-throughput SAXS is limited by the time-consuming and, at times, subjective nature of SAXS data interpretation. We present SAXS Assistant, a Python-based script that streamlines SAXS data analysis to extract features for machine learning (ML) and key structural parameters, including the Guinier radius of gyration (Rg), pair distance distribution function (PDDF)-derived Rg, maximum particle dimension (Dmax), and Kratky plots. The script builds upon BioXTAS RAW, and validates reliability via Guinier/PDDF Rg agreement, an important indicator of well-measured datasets. For assistance in Dmax estimation, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor was trained with 1,940 data files from the small angle scattering biological data bank (SASBDB). The model achieved a test set performance R2 = 0.90 and mean absolute error (MAE) = 11.7 Å. Training exclusively with experimental data translates analyses from researchers, including experts in the field, to the ML model, which helps assess Dmax estimations from PDDF. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering was implemented to classify profiles into structural classes based on entries in the SASBDB. Users may therefore assess the similarity between experimental samples and known biomolecular shapes within the mapped repository entries. This probabilistic clustering aids in quantifying information from Kratky and generating shape-descriptive features. SAXS Assistant accelerates SAXS data analysis through enforced quality control, ML-ready outputs, and flags for low-confidence results. In addition to providing the ability to analyze large datasets at high-throughput, this tool is versatile and may serve researchers in both biological and synthetic polymer research fields.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative movement disorder. It is characterized by both motor and non-motor, including neuropsychiatric disturbances such as depression and anxiety. The locus coeruleus (LC), a small nucleus in the brainstem, plays a key role in these symptoms and has white matter connections to the thalamus. This study aims to investigate this LC-thalamic tract in PD patients using ultra-high-field diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and to examine its relationship with non-motor symptoms.
Methods
100 participants, including 69 early-stage PD and 31 healthy control (HC) participants were evaluated using several questionnaires and a 7T diffusion MRI scan. Tractography was performed to reconstruct the LC-thalamic white matter tract, and diffusion parameters (FA, MD, AD, RD) were analysed.
Results
PD patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in the white matter tissue compared to HC, indicating reduced white matter integrity.
Discussion
This study shows the feasibility to visualize the LC-thalamic tract with the use of 7T DWI data. The results provide evidence of the association between the integrity of the white matter tracts and early PD development, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of the LC and its white matter connections in the progression of PD and neuropsychiatric and other symptoms.

Abstract: Central nervous system (CNS) disorders present a profound global health burden, yet therapeutic progress is frequently impeded by their mechanistic complexity, the restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the limitations of traditional mammalian models. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a powerful vertebrate model system uniquely positioned to surmount these obstacles. Its genetic tractability and the conserved principles of its neurovascular development provide an unparalleled platform for dissecting complex disease pathways in vivo. The optical transparency of zebrafish larvae, in particular, enables real-time, high-resolution imaging of dynamic cellular processes, such as neuroinflammation and neurovascular unit dysfunction, offering mechanistic insights unattainable in other models. Furthermore, key physiological traits—including external fertilization for high-throughput screening and exceptional hypoxia tolerance for robust ischemic stroke modeling—make zebrafish an ideal tool for both fundamental research and preclinical drug discovery. This review synthesizes the pivotal contributions of the zebrafish model to our understanding of a wide spectrum of CNS disorders, and highlights its expanding role in accelerating the identification of novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Chitosan, a biopolymer derived from chitin—the second most abundant natural polysaccharide found in crustaceans such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimp—has become a cornerstone in biomedical innovation. Its unique properties, including hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and intrinsic cationic nature, make it an ideal candidate for the development of sustainable and multifunctional nanomaterials. Chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs), distinguished by their nanoscale size and enhanced physicochemical characteristics, offer significant advantages in biomedicine, particularly in diagnostic imaging as targeted delivery systems for drugs, genes, and biomolecules in cancer therapy. The green synthesis of CNPs through methods such as microemulsion, polyelectrolyte complexation, ionic gelation, emulsification-solvent diffusion, and reverse micellization further emphasizes their eco-friendly and sustainable production. Recognized as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) material by the USA Food and Drug Administration, chitosan is widely accepted for use in biomedical applications. This review comprehensively explores the structural features, environmentally benign synthesis strategies, and advanced characterization techniques of CNPs. Moreover, it highlights their interdisciplinary biomedical applications, including drug delivery via ocular, oral, pulmonary, vaginal, and nasal routes, as well as their promising role in tissue engineering and cancer therapy. By integrating green chemistry principles with advanced biomedical design, CNPs are reshaping the future of nanomedicine, offering sustainable and targeted therapeutic solutions.

Abstract: Berberis species are rich in isoquinoline alkaloids with promising therapeutic properties for various diseases, including SARS-CoV-2. Despite their known medicinal attributes, the potential for combining them at suitable doses remains underexplored. This study investigated the compound–target interactions, functional enrichment, and pharmacokinetic profiles of seven B. vulgaris alkaloids (berberine, palmatine, berberrubine, lambertine, obamegine, berbidine, and berbamine) using an in-silico approach. Compound–target interactions were identified using SwissTargetPrediction. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using STRING in Cytoscape, and an UpSet plot was generated in Python to visualize overlapping targets and potential synergy. Functional enrichment analysis was performed in DAVID using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, followed by compound-gene-pathway network construction in Cytoscape. Pharmacokinetic profiles of compounds were assessed using ADMET-AI. A total of 42 genes were shared by at least two compounds. Genes associated with neurotransmission (DRD, ADRA, and ADRB) were identified as hubs mediating key functional interactions. Berbamine and obamegine shared the highest number of targets (10). Functional enrichment by KEGG and GO identified 16 and 20 significantly enriched pathways and biological processes, respectively, and formed networks consisting of distinct nodes (pathway = 67, GOBP = 69) and edges (pathway = 228, GOBP = 229). Favorable drug-likeness was identified for alkaloids, excluding berbamine and obamegine (0.3), and low clinical toxicity (0.0 to 0.3). The results highlight the therapeutic potential of B. vulgaris alkaloids to provide complementary and synergistic effects across different disease pathways and support their development in botanical medicine.

Abstract: Glyphosate, a widely used herbicide in North America, has become prevalent in the food supply, raising concerns about potential health impacts. In this exploratory study, male and female F0 mice were exposed to glyphosate through drinking water during mating and gestation. We investigated whether prenatal exposure at dietary-relevant levels (0.01 mg/kg/day, Average American Diet, [AAD]) or the U.S. EPA's acceptable daily intake (1.75 mg/kg/day, [EPA Upper Limit]) altered gut, metabolic, and behavioral outcomes across two generations in mice with or without genetic susceptibility to colitis (Muc2+/− and Muc2−/−, respectively). Healthy (Muc2+/−) offspring of glyphosate-exposed mice exhibited colonic goblet cell depletion, reduced mucin-2 expression, and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both F1 and F2 generations. These healthy (Muc2+/−) offspring also developed metabolic dysfunction, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and reduced GLP-1 in serum. Behavioral deficits were also observed in healthy (Muc2+/−) mice including reduced locomotion and working memory. These changes were accompanied by significant shifts in gut microbiome composition and associations between specific microbes, including Akkermansia muciniphila and Parabacteroides distasonis and gut-brain signaling molecules including GLP-1 and serotonin, suggesting a microbiota-mediated mechanism for neuroendocrine disruption. In contrast, colitis-susceptible (Muc2−/−) mice showed fewer overt exposure effects, likely due to masking by their baseline disease phenotype, but did show alterations consistent with enteric neuroinflammation resulting from glyphosate exposure including blooms in Cyanobacteria and reduced tryptophan metabolites. These findings suggest that prenatal glyphosate exposure, even below regulatory thresholds, may disrupt multiple physiological systems across generations, highlighting the need for further research and potential regulatory consideration.

Abstract: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are a highly aggressive and inoperable type of paediatric brain tumours, with a median survival of less than one year. Therapeutic progress has been hindered by the tumour’s anatomical location, its extensive molecular heterogeneity, and the restrictive nature of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in drug delivery. This article explores the current therapeutic landscape of DMG and evaluates emerging drug delivery strategies, including oral, intravenous and intrathecal administration, convection-enhanced delivery (CED), and intranasal approaches, designed to improve drug access to the brain. Advancements in these methods, combined with targeted therapies tailored to the tumour’s unique molecular features, represent a critical pathway towards improving clinical outcomes for DMG patients.

Abstract: Sleep stage classification is essential for sleep research and clinical diagnostics. However, frequency aliasing in sleep electroencephalogram (s-EEG) signals remains a significant challenge, existing methods have yet to effectively address this issue. This study proposes a hybrid deep-learning model, RimeSleepNet, comprising four key components. First, the rime optimization algorithm adaptively tunes variational mode decomposition (VMD) to reduce frequency aliasing by generating intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) automatically extracts stage-specific features from IMFs. A multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism then dynamically weights these features to prioritize stage-specific patterns, followed by long short-term memory (LSTM) networks that model temporal dynamics for robust classification of NREM, REM, and WAKE stages. Evaluated on the Chengdu People’s Hospital and Sleep-EDF datasets, RimeSleepNet achieves the highest F1 scores of 0.94, 0.89, and 0.92 for NREM, REM, and WAKE stages, respectively, with an AUC of 0.92, outperforming baseline models like CNN and LSTM. Cross-dataset validation confirms its robust generalization (Cohen’s κ = 0.90), and it reduces validation loss by 53% compared to LSTM, providing an advanced tool for automated sleep stage analysis in sleep disorder diagnosis and personalized monitoring.

Abstract: The assessment of gait variability is a valuable approach for characterizing an individual’s walking pattern over extended time scales. Variability parameters, such as the coefficient of variation, the Hurst exponent, and the Minkowski fractal dimension of the attractor, are influenced by factors like age, dual-task performance, and neurodegenerative conditions. Treadmill walking, a compact and widely used method, enables precise data collection when combined with measurement devices. However, differences between treadmill and overground variability raise questions about its applicability to real-life gait analysis. This study investigates how treadmill walking, as an external stressor, reveals gait variability differences among children, young adults, and seniors by analyzing the center of mass trajectory. Fifteen children (median age: 11 years), 24 young adults (median age: 22.5 years), and 16 seniors (median age: 60 years) participated. Variability was assessed using stride intervals and phase-space metrics. Results indicate that young adults demonstrate “optimal” gait variability, characterized by minimal coefficients of variation and maximal fractal dimension. In contrast, children and seniors exhibit less predictable and less complex gait patterns, with differences in Hurst exponents distinguishing these groups. These findings highlight the nontrivial integration of age, fear of falling, and neurological maturation in gait variability. Practical implications for rehabilitation and clinical assessments are discussed, underscoring the need for protocol standardization and cautious interpretation of treadmill-based variability data.

Abstract: This review systematically examines the phytochemical composition of Sambucus nigra L. (SN) —particularly terpenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids—and their structure-function relationships in food matrices. We analyze traditional uses, modern applications in functional foods, and underlying molecular mechanisms through comprehensive literature evaluation. SN's health benefits primarily stem from flavonoid-mediated modulation of NF-κB and PPARγ pathways, demonstrating dose-dependent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, its anthocyanins demonstrate significant potential in natural food preservation and immune-support applications. Despite these advantages, challenges persist in standardizing bioactive compounds and substantiating health claims. The study underscores the groundbreaking method of amalgamating traditional knowledge with contemporary scientific evidence to propose strategies for enhancing bioavailability and creating functional foods from elderberry.

Abstract: Topic
This article explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the differentiation of choroidal melanocytic lesions, specifically choroidal nevi and small melanomas, within the field of ocular oncology. The primary topic highlights the significance of accurately diagnosing these lesions to enhance patient outcomes and management strategies.
Clinical Relevance
The clinical relevance of the study is underscored by the need for improved diagnostic accuracy, as misdiagnosis can lead to delayed or inappropriate treatment decisions, ultimately affecting patient survival and quality of life.
Methods
To achieve this, the methods discussed in this paper revolve around employing deep learning techniques, which utilize artificial neural networks to analyze high-dimensional medical images. This approach enables automated classification and image analysis of ophthalmic data, allowing for the identification of intricate patterns and features that may be imperceptible to clinicians. Additionally, the text reviews existing clinical and imaging risk factors associated with the growth of choroidal nevi into melanoma, leveraging this information to inform and enhance AI algorithms.
Results
The anticipated results of integrating AI into clinical practice include increased diagnostic accuracy, which can lead to earlier identification of high-risk lesions and, consequently, timely interventions. This proactive approach has the potential to improve patient care significantly by facilitating better management strategies, thus enhancing patient outcomes. AI may also uncover subtle imaging features that would otherwise be overlooked, providing a more comprehensive assessment of lesions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in ocular oncology, advocating for its integration with existing imaging technologies. While AI offers promising advancements in diagnostic practices and patient care, the paper also acknowledges the necessity of addressing regulatory and implementation challenges to fully harness these benefits. Overall, the incorporation of AI technologies into the diagnostic workflow has the potential to not only save vision but also improve survival rates, marking a significant step forward in the management of choroidal melanocytic lesions.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of age-related and chronic neuromuscular disorders has led to a surge in lower-limb motor impairments, posing substantial challenges to mobility, autonomy, and rehabilitation. Decoding electroencephalography (EEG) or surface electromyography (sEMG) biosignals into locomotor intentions using intelligent machine learning algorithms is essential for assisting patients in performing functional tasks such as walking, stair ascent and descent, and obstacle negotiation. However, achieving stable bioelectrical signals for accurate locomotor intent decoding remains challenging due to poor skin-electrode contact, signal drift, and motion-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, we report a self-adhesive ionic skin composed of polyvinylamine (PVAm) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), which together form a hydrogen-bonded polyamine network enriched with protonatable amine groups. This ionic skin exhibits high ionic conductivity (0.0217S·m−1), low interfacial impedance (937.2 Ω), and compliant mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 0.14 MPa), closely matching the biomechanics of hunman skin to ensure durable and conformal adhesion through electrostatic interactions. This stable interface enables reliable acquisition of sEMG and EEG signals under mechanical deformation and perspiration, maintaining high signal fidelity (SNR of 24.63) during prolonged use for at least three weeks. Leveraging the stable biosignals acquired from PVAm-PEI ionic skin, we trained a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying key locomotor modes, including level walking, stair ascent, stair descent, and obstacle negotiation, in older adults with impaired gait, achieving 98.4 % accuracy. This capability enables real-time decoding of motor intention, markedly enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of assistive exoskeletons. By integrating ionic material innovation, high-fidelity biosignal acquisition, and intent-aware neuromechanical decoding, this work offers a scalable and long-term platform for continuous electrophysiological monitoring and individualized gait rehabilitation in both clinical and real-world settings.

Abstract: Objectives
While depression is a risk factor for dementia, few studies examining the association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and dementia risk have controlled for confounding major depression and none to our knowledge have examined neuropathological outcomes. We examined the association between continuation of SSRIs in older adults with a lifetime history of depression on progression of cognitive and functional impairment, depression, and neuropathologic correlates of dementia.
Design
This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center.
Participants
Participants aged ≥ 55 years or older were required to have clinician documented lifetime history of depression (N=688). 463 (67.3%) reported continued SSRI use at every study visit prior to death.
Measurements
Primary clinical outcomes included the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Neuropathological outcomes included assessments of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pathology and cerebrovascular changes relevant to Vascular dementia (VaD).
Results
Continued SSRI use during later life was associated with a significantly slower increase on the CDR-SB compared to discontinuation of SSRIs. Rates of change on the FAQ and GDS-15 did not differ significantly between groups. While rates of AD pathology did not differ significantly between groups, continued SSRI use was associated with significantly lower rates of lacunes/infarcts on autopsy after controlling for smoking years and hypertension.
Conclusions
Persistent use of SSRIs prior to death was associated with decreased progression of cognitive impairment and a nearly 50% reduction of lacunes/infarcts on autopsy. Our study is the first of our knowledge to identify associations between SSRI exposure in later life and neuropathological changes relevant to VaD on autopsy, which is considered the gold standard of diagnosis.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Primary headaches, particularly tension-type headaches (TTH) and migraine, are common and are associated with several comorbidities, including psychiatric conditions such as depression and suicide. However, there is limited evidence on the temporal relationship between primary headaches and subsequent depression and suicide, and most prior research has relied on self-reported data or cross-sectional designs. This population-based retrospective cohort study used data from the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort and involved 459,347 participants. Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to compute adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the risk of depression and suicide from 2006 to 2019 according to exposure to primary headaches from 2002 to 2005. Primary headaches were significantly associated with an elevated risk of depression (aHR for TTH = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.49–1.62, aHR for migraine = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.45–1.55) in both men and women. Tension-type headache was linked to a higher risk of suicide with statistical significance in men (aHR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.00–1.94), but not in women (aHR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.73–1.69). Migraine was not significantly associated with suicide (aHR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.91–1.46). Primary headaches are associated with an increased risk of depression in both men and women. Tension-type headache is related to an elevated risk of suicide in men. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive management of headache disorders that addresses both the physical and mental health aspects, not only in women but also in the male population.

Abstract: Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is primarily metabolized through four key pathways: the kynurenine pathway, serotonin pathways, indole pathways and interleukin 4-induced gene 1 (IL-4I1) pathways. Dysregulation of tryptophan metabolism is implicated in various non-communicable diseases including psychiatric disorders, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as metabolic diseases. The dogma in the field is that tryptophan is metabolized via the kynurenine pathway in the liver mainly by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1/2 (IDO 1/2) and Tryptophan dioxygenase 2 (TDO2) enzymes. However, there is growing evidence demonstrating that IL-4I1 and tryptophanase are also crucial tryptophan catabolizing enzymes resulting in metabolites that activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and modulate immune responses. Tryptophan metabolism is crucial in cellular, tissue and organismal function and its disruption is linked to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and psychiatric disorders like depression, anxiety and metabolic diseases such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes. It is unclear though whether only specific tryptophan pathways are associated with disease or there is a level of redundancy. Some key metabolites from tryptophan catabolism can come from multiple pathways, with opposing or converging effects on cellular functions. This review will explore the critical role of tryptophan metabolism in health and diseases, focusing on its implications in non-communicable diseases. Importantly, this review will focus on recent developments in tryptophan metabolism and strengthen the argument for a revised schematic tryptophan catabolic pathway.

Abstract: Granzyme B (GrB) is a serine protease primarily involved in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated apoptosis through caspase activation. However, emerging evidence suggests that GrB also plays a role in inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, contributing to skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD). GrB is expressed by various immune and non-immune cells, including mast cells, macrophages, and keratinocytes, where it functions independently of perforin to degrade ECM components like fibronectin and decorin. In AD, elevated GrB levels correlate with disease severity, and GrB-deficient mice exhibit reduced AD symptoms, suggesting that inhibiting GrB could be a promising therapeutic approach. Despite its pathological significance, selective GrB inhibitors remain scarce. In this study, we identified cynaroside, a flavonoid compound, as a novel natural inhibitor of GrB. Virtual screening and molecular docking analysis revealed that cynaroside interacts with the Asp88 residue of GrB, forming stable hydrogen bonds that interfere with its catalytic activity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed that this interaction remains stable over 200 ns. Additionally, cynaroside inhibited GrB activity in vitro and significantly reduced fibronectin cleavage. Immunohistochemical analysis further demonstrated decreased GrB expression and preserved fibronectin levels in cynaroside-treated AD mice. Moreover, cynaroside treatment led to a reduction in epidermal thickening and immune cell infiltration, including mast cells and Th2 cells—key indicators of AD severity. These findings highlight cynaroside's potential as a targeted GrB inhibitor for inflammatory skin diseases.

Abstract: The interstitial drug delivery system, with a long-standing history in pharmaceutical science, has recently regained significant attention due to its pivotal role in enhancing drug transport to lymphatic vessels and improving lymph node targeting. The success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a new era for interstitial-based drug delivery strategies. Consequently, advancing the development of next-generation interstitial delivery systems necessitates a deeper understanding of interstitial physiology. This review systematically summarizes the physiological composition and functions of the interstitium, discusses the distinct characteristics of diverse interstitial administration routes, evaluates recent advances in formulation design and clinical translation efforts of advanced delivery systems, and highlights current challenges and future directions in the field. By providing this comprehensive analysis, we aim to stimulate the wider clinical application of interstitial delivery systems in therapeutic practice.

Abstract: Background
Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a promising cell-based therapy given their ability to differentiate into various cell types for therapeutic use. Although clinical trials using these cells have recently emerged, such trials are small, heterogenous in design, and examine a broad range of diseases. A systematic scoping review of published clinical studies and registered trials is needed to understand important aspects of study design and identify barriers to greater clinical adoption.
Methods
A systematic search of published clinical studies was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1946 to January 29, 2025) and ongoing registered clinical trials in Clinical Trials.Gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (January 29, 2025). Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Meta-analysis was not performed given the small number and size of included studies.
Results
We identified 10 published clinical studies and 22 ongoing registered trials utilizing iPSCs to treat a wide range of diseases, including cardiac conditions, ocular disorders, cancer, graft-versus-host disease, and as a source of platelets for transfusion. Published studies were mostly small (only 2 studies reported on more than 4 patients) and uncontrolled, with a total of 115 patients treated. While iPSC characterization was generally aligned with criteria established by the International Society for Stem Cell Research, considerable variability was observed in terms of study design, medical conditions examined, and cell source used for iPSC generation. Moreover, a broad range of iPSC-derived cell products were administered. Variability among studies and ongoing trials may complicate and delay our understanding of the safety and efficacy of iPSC-based therapies.
Conclusion
iPSCs are poised to have a significant impact on clinical care for patients with conditions such as cardiac disease, cancer, and ocular disorders. We anticipate a period of several more years before the safety and efficacy of iPSC-based therapies can be definitively determined. Standardized study protocols and adherence to iPSC-derived product characterization criteria could facilitate more accelerated approval of iPSC-based therapies.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. Although levodopa remains the standard therapy, long-term use leads to reduced efficacy and motor complications. Acupuncture-related therapies have gained attention as safe, affordable adjuncts, but the comparative effectiveness of different modalities remains uncertain.
Method
We conducted a comprehensive search of Chinese and international databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture-related therapies for PD. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined PICOS criteria. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the RoB 2.0 tool. A frequentist network meta-analysis was performed using Stata SE 15.1. For continuous outcomes, mean differences were calculated; for binary outcomes, risk ratios were used. A random-effects model was applied, with heterogeneity assessed by τ² and consistency tested across the network. SUCRA values were calculated to rank the comparative efficacy of interventions.
Result
Fifty-seven RCTs (n = 4,262; 2002–2024) were included. Interventions comprised manual acupuncture (MA), electroacupuncture (EA), warm acupuncture (WA), fire acupuncture (FA), and moxibustion (MOX), used alone or in combination with conventional medication (CM) or Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). For total effective rate (41 RCTs; n = 3,086), the most pronounced benefit was observed with EA + WA + CM (RR = 3.00; 95% CI: 1.20–7.48; SUCRA = 97%; moderate confidence). Significant improvements were also found for MOX + CM (RR = 1.33; 1.07–1.64; SUCRA = 68.8%), MA + CM (RR = 1.20; 1.10–1.32; SUCRA = 51.7%), and EA + CM (RR = 1.15; 1.05–1.26; SUCRA = 38.3%). For UPDRS (36 RCTs; n = 2,655), MA + CM significantly improved motor symptoms compared with CM (MD = –0.89; 95% CI: –1.58 to –0.20; SUCRA = 61.6%; moderate certainty). For Webster score (5 RCTs; n = 444), both EA + CM (MD = –3.65; –5.01 to –2.28; SUCRA = 91.1%) and MA + CM (MD = –2.62; –4.31 to –0.92; SUCRA = 61.8%) were superior to CM. For HAMD (11 RCTs; n = 802), significant reductions in depressive symptoms were observed with MA + CM (MD = –2.41; 95% CI: –3.48 to –1.34; SUCRA = 91.9%) and EA + CM (MD = –2.16; 95% CI: –3.74 to –0.58; SUCRA = 62.8%). CINeMA ratings were low to moderate for most pairwise comparisons.
Conclusion
Acupuncture-based therapies provided added benefits over conventional medication for Parkinson’s disease. EA + WA + CM showed the most consistent improvement in overall effectiveness, MA + CM was most effective for motor symptoms, EA + CM and MA + CM demonstrated superiority for Webster scores, and MA + CM also performed best for depressive symptoms. Although the certainty of evidence ranged from low to moderate, these findings suggest that tailored combinations of acupuncture and conventional treatment may optimize outcomes in PD.

Abstract: Objective
The purpose of this case report is to describe chiropractic management of a patient with neck pain, cervical kyphosis, cervical radiculopathy, and resting tremors of the left arm.
Clinical Features
A 58-year-old White male presented with an insidious onset of severe neck pain and burning pain down the left arm with accompanying involuntary resting tremors of the left arm. The pain and tremors limited his ability to sit, walk, work, drive, sleep, and perform household chores, with driving and sleeping reportedly being the most substantial activities affected. Clinical testing revealed left cervical radiculopathy with severe myospasm in the scalene and levator scapulae muscles. Radiographs revealed reversed cervical curvature and degenerative spondylosis with neural foraminal encroachment at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7.
Intervention and Outcome
The patient was initially managed with soft tissue therapy to the upper trapezius and levator scapulae, and gentle manual cervical traction for 4 visits over the course of 1 week. This was followed by incorporation of cervical spinal manipulation using low force adjustments, manual cervical traction, and thoracic spinal manipulation using diversified technique 3 times a week for 3 additional weeks. After active treatment, a monthly maintenance plan was prescribed. At the start of treatment, the Numeric Pain Rating (NPR) was recorded at 8/10, and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) Score was 26%. At 1- and 2-year follow-ups, NPR was recorded as 0/10 and 0/10, respectively, and NDI Score was 4% and 0%, respectively.
Conclusion
Neck and arm pain and debilitating tremors resolved in a patient who received chiropractic care. These improvements were maintained 2 years after the start of treatment.

Abstract: Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) has the potential to restore vision and hearing by stimulating relevant cortical regions in both animals and humans, offering significant clinical promise for sensory restoration. While the neuronal response to ICMS has been extensively studied at the cellular level through electrophysiology and two-photon (2P) imaging, the response of non-neuronal cells, particularly microglia, as well as the effects on blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity remain poorly understood. In this study, we applied ICMS under 2P imaging in dual-reporter mice, with green fluorescent protein labeling microglia and a red fluorescent Ca2+ indicator labeling neurons. We also monitored vascular dye leakage to assess BBB integrity. Using clinically relevant waveforms, we tested a range of current amplitudes. Surprisingly, we found that microglia responded within 15 min of stimulation by converging their processes (MPC) on areas of high neural activity and the prevalence of MPC increased at higher current amplitudes. Additionally, vascular dye penetration into brain tissue was higher in stimulated animals and increased with current amplitude. This study reveals a rapid microglia and BBB response to ICMS that has not been reported previously, underscoring the need for further research to fully characterize the biological response to ICMS and establish improved safety standards.

Abstract: SUMMARY
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two auditory-perceptual voice assessment tools, GRBASZero (an AI-based application) and Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V), in evaluating voice impairments in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The research sought to determine the sensitivity and reliability of these tools across different stages of PD severity, focusing on parameters such as overall severity, roughness, breathiness, strain, loudness, and pitch.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 44 PD patients, categorized by disease severity using the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Voice samples were collected through sustained vowels /a/. Trained speech-language pathologists (SLP) performed CAPE-V assessments, while GRBASZero evaluations were conducted using an AI application, while GRBASZero evaluations were conducted using an AI application. Statistical analyses included the Kruskal-Wallis test and correlation tests to compare the tools' performance.
Results
This study showed that CAPE-V has higher sensitivity in identifying voice disorders at all stages of the disease (all P values < 0.05), while GRBASZero only detects Breathiness and Strain parameters at advanced stages (P = 0.049 and P = 0.034, respectively). Analyses were performed based on the vowel /a/ and the common parameters of the two instruments. The findings highlight the importance of choosing the appropriate instrument based on the stage of the disease.
Conclusion
CAPE-V is more comprehensive and sensitive for assessing voice impairments in PD patients across all disease stages, making it preferable for clinical and research use. GRBASZero, while useful for monitoring vocal strain and breathiness in advanced PD, lacks sensitivity in early stages. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate tools for early diagnosis and monitoring of voice disorders in PD.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
The pervasive inflammatory response orchestrates every stage of tumor initiation and progression, not only serving as a catalyst for tumorigenesis but also as a nurturing environment for malignant growth. Within this intricate microenvironment teeming with cancer cells, immune cells, and stromal cells, a continuous exchange of inflammatory signals mediated by exosomes, small membrane-bound vesicles guide the development of the proinflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we delve into the intricate dialogue mechanisms among tumor cells, resident immune cells and stromal cells, scrutinizing the roles of exosomes derived from both tumor cells and other resident cells in shaping the inflammatory milieu. Anti-tumor therapies harnessing the diverse compositions and effects of exosomes have unveiled novel strategies for combating tumor malignancy.

Abstract: Biological aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by the progressive erosion of cellular homeostasis, driven by intersecting pathways of inflammaging, immune senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, and genomic instability. This review delineates current knowledge on the interconnected mechanisms underlying aging-related diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, sarcopenia, neurodegenerative disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. We further discuss the critical role of contributing factors such as microbiome dysbiosis, sex differences, and exosome-mediated communication in modulating disease progression. Advancements in multi-omics technologies and AI-driven biomarkers, particularly epigenetic clocks, are highlighted for their ability to precisely quantify biological aging and stratify disease risk. Finally, we explore the therapeutic potential and promising clinical trials of targeting these shared mechanisms with senolytics, mitochondrial enhancers, and immunomodulators, offering a paradigm shift from disease-specific treatment to holistic interventions designed to extend healthspan.

Abstract: Aim
To characterize the nature and prevalence of comorbid conditions, as well as the extent of exposure to concomitant medications other than antiseizure medications (ASMs), in a large cohort of adults with epilepsy.
Materials and Methods
This was a prospective, non-interventional, single-center study involving consecutive patients receiving care at a university epilepsy clinic. Demographic data, epilepsy characteristics, comorbid conditions, and medication use were retrieved from medical records during two consecutive clinical visits. Comorbidities were categorized according to the ICD-10, while medications were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.
Results
The final cohort included 517 patients (60 % female; median age: 35 years; SD ± 12). Focal epilepsy was present in 64 % of patients, and 58 % were drug-resistant. Comorbidities were observed in 48 % of patients, and 41 % received at least one non-ASM medication. Patients with comorbidities or concomitant medications were older, had a later epilepsy onset, and more frequently presented with focal and drug-resistant epilepsy. The most common comorbidity categories (ICD-10) were mental and behavioral disorders (22 %), endocrine/metabolic diseases (18 %), and circulatory system disorders (13 %). Frequently used non-ASMs included selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (7 %), antipsychotics (7 %), and thyroid preparations (7 %). Comorbidities and comedication were significantly more common in drug-resistant cases (p = 0.007), focal epilepsy (p < 0.001), and with increasing age (rho = 0.310, p < 0.001). Notably, 73 % of patients on non-ASMs were also treated with enzyme-inducing or enzyme-inhibiting ASMs, posing a potential risk of drug interactions.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that nearly half of adults with epilepsy present with comorbid conditions and that more than 40% require concomitant non-ASM medications. Mental and behavioral, endocrine/metabolic, and circulatory disorders were the most frequent comorbidities, while antidepressants, antipsychotics, and thyroid preparations were the most commonly prescribed medications. Both comorbidities and comedications were more prevalent in patients with focal and drug-resistant epilepsy and in older individuals. These results underscore the importance of systematically assessing comorbid conditions and non-ASM use in clinical practice to optimize treatment and minimize the risk of drug interactions.

Abstract: Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder linked to CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene. These expanded repeats produce toxic FMR1poly-Glycine (FMR1polyG) proteins in neurons through mechanisms such as Repeat-Associated Non-AUG (RAN) translation and RNA foci formation, driving disease progression. In this study, we investigate the potential of Nitazoxanide (NTZ), a broad-spectrum antiparasitic and antiviral medication, as a therapeutic agent for FXTAS by targeting CGG repeat-associated toxicity. This comprehensive approach utilizing biophysical techniques, bioinformatic studies, cellular assays, and Drosophila models reveals NTZ's remarkable ability to bind specifically to toxic CGG repeat RNA, particularly GG mismatches, and to inhibit FMR1polyG aggregation. Biophysical methods, including Circular Dichroism (CD), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), Electrophoretic Mobility Shift assays (EMSA), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, accompanied with Molecular Docking, confirmed that NTZ effectively binds to CGG repeat RNA and mitigates its toxicity. Moreover, treatment with NTZ significantly reduced FMR1polyG-associated toxicity, corrected the splicing defects in FXTAS cell models, and improved different phenotypes in the Drosophila model of FXTAS. These compelling findings position NTZ as a promising candidate for neuroprotection in FXTAS, indicating its remarkable therapeutic potential and paving the way for future clinical applications to improve outcomes for the affected patients.

Abstract: The scope of smart grids is progressively extending toward Integrated Energy Systems (IES) that couple electricity with gas, heating, and cooling. Due to the unsteady-state physical characteristics inherent in the transmission of gas, heat, and cooling resources, IES scheduling must not only balance multiple typical objectives but also account for the dynamic coupling of heterogeneous physical domains. To address these challenges, this paper formulates a Many-objective Optimization Model for Coupled Multi-Energy Flows (MaOCMFM) with partial differential equations (PDEs) in IES, which captures the dynamic physical behaviors of electricity, gas, heat, and cooling subsystems. Building upon this model, we propose a Probabilistic Contributing Many-objective Evolutionary Algorithm enhanced by a Physics-Informed Neural Network surrogate model (PC-MaOEA-PINN). Cubic B-spline functions are employed to achieve a continuous representation of the decision variables, while multi-physics constraints are embedded into the loss function of the surrogate model. This design enables efficient approximation of the objective function with a limited number of samples and facilitates focused exploration in critical evolutionary regions, thereby accelerating population convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is validated on 9 typical scheduling days across four simulated IES scenarios.

Abstract: Neuroscience has probed only a sliver of the rich cognitive, emotional, and social behaviors that enable primates to thrive in the real world. Technological breakthroughs allow us to quantify these behaviors alongside wireless neural recordings. New studies reveal that neural activity is intricately bound to movement and is profoundly modulated by behavioral context, emotional states, and social dynamics. We frame our review of primate neuroethology around Niko Tinbergen’s four foundational questions – function, mechanism, development, and evolution – to unify classic ethological insights with modern neuroscience tools. We demonstrate that investigating natural behavior promises deep insights into primate cognition, which are relevant for advanced brain–machine interfaces, improved therapies for neurological disorders, and deeper understanding of natural and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: A process for producing 200 kt/y of H2 via molten metal (MM)-based CH4 pyrolysis was analyzed for global warming potential (GWP) and economic feasibility, considering MM catalysts (Te and NiBi), metal impurities (1 %–0.001 %) in the carbon byproduct, and heat supply. The CH4 conversion reached 34 % for Te-based BCR at 800 °C and 43 % for BCR using Ni0·27Bi0·73 at 1065 °C. The CO2 equivalent emissions were driven by MM losses (∼1.75 kg-CO2/kg-H2), MM catalysts (∼0.88 kg-CO2/kg-H2), and heat sources (∼0.83 kg-CO2/kg-H2). The levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) varied by ±$4/kg-H2 due to MM losses, with additional costs of $0.4–0.5/kg-H2 for electric arc furnace (EAF) heating compared to the natural gas-fired furnace (NFF). For Te-based BCR, the LCOH ranged $2.7–7.2/kg-H2, while the NiBi-based process exhibited a lower range of $2.3–3.2/kg-H2. This study revealed that MM catalysts and loss influence CO2 emissions and LCOH in the MM-based CH4 pyrolysis process.

Abstract: —The unique vascularized anatomy of the human eye, encased in the retina, provides an opportunity to act as a window for human health. The retinal structure assists in assessing the early detection, monitoring of disease progression and interven- tion for both ocular and non-ocular diseases. The advancement in imaging technology leveraging Artificial Intelligence has seized this opportunity to bridge the gap between the eye and human health. This approach facilitates the unveiling of systemic health insights from the ocular system and the identification of non- invasive surrogate markers for timely intervention and detection. The new frontiers of oculomics in ophthalmology cover both ocular and systemic diseases, and are getting more attention to explore them. In this survey paper, we explore the evolution of retinal imaging techniques, the dire need for the integration of AI-driven analysis, and the shift of retinal imaging from classical techniques to oculomics. We also discuss some hurdles that may be faced in the progression of oculomics, highlighting the research gaps and future directions.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
The phytochemical assessment of Pogostemon esquirolii resulted in the isolation and identification of sixteen sesquiterpenoids, including eudesmane-type (1–6, 9, and 11), bisabolane-type (8 and 10), caryolane-type (13–14), guaiacane-type (15–16), and other types (7 and 12). Of them, compounds 1–10, namely pogostesquines A–J, are ten previously undescribed ones. Compound 7 possessed an unusual backbone with the isopropyl group substituted at C-8 instead of C-7. Their structures were confirmed by extensive spectroscopic analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, and ECD calculations. All the compounds were reported from this plant for the first time. Biological evaluation revealed that compound 4 exhibited the most anti-neuroinflammatory activity by inhibiting NO production in LPS-induced BV2 mouse microglial cells. Subsequently, network pharmacology analyses indicated that compound 4 primarily alleviated neuroinflammation-induced cognitive dysfunction through the TNF signaling pathway. Molecular docking studies, molecular dynamics simulations techniques, and western blotting analysis further clarified that compound 4 could downregulate the expression of TNF-α and IL-6, and inhibit the activity of inflammation-associated inducible enzymes iNOS and COX-2. Concurrently, it was further demonstrated that compound 4 could inhibit the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways via the TNF pathway.

Abstract: We propose a set of machine learning models, based on recurrent neural networks, for the prediction of stock market spillovers. While classic spillover models, such as the Diebold–Yilmaz approach, can explain which are the spillover effects, we aim to predict them, and provide an early warning system. To assess the effectiveness of our proposal, we compare our predictions to the actual return and volatility spillovers across fourteen major equity market indices, spanning the period from January 2000 through January 2024, and considering two hundred rolling window test samples. Our empirical findings show that the predictions are quite accurate, and that the Gate Recurrent Unit network consistently outperforms the other models, primarily due to its ability to capture complex and non-linear dependencies.

Abstract: Summary
The prevailing theory on the origins of mitochondria proposes that they were once independent organisms. Though symbiotically integrated into eukaryotic cells, they have retained a striking degree of autonomy. This self-governance manifests as the capacity to sense internal metabolic, ionic, and redox states and transduce these into signals that modulate cellular function—a process we refer to as mitochondrial inside-out signaling. These mitochondria-initiated signaling mechanisms are crucial for bioenergetic homeostasis of all cells, including neurons. Unlike conventional outside-in signaling, these mitochondria-initiated signals stem from within the organelle and propagate outward, tuning cytosolic signaling pathways, nuclear transcriptional programs, and neuronal behavior. In this review, we provide mechanistic insights into this distinct and underappreciated signaling modality, discussing how internal mitochondrial conditions are sensed and transmitted to the cytosol and how these signaling events influence mitochondrial and cellular health with a focus on their implications for neuronal physiology and disease vulnerability.

Abstract: Summary
Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is a central regulator of intestinal barrier function, inflammation, and pain. Upregulated intestinal proteolysis and PAR2 signaling are implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), conditions often associated with gut microbiome alterations. To identify potential bacterial regulators of PAR2 activity, we developed a functional assay for PAR2 processing to screen a library of diverse gut microbes. We identify multiple bacteria that secrete proteases capable of cleaving host PAR2. Using chemoproteomic profiling with a covalent irreversible inhibitor, we uncovered a previously uncharacterized Bacteroides fragilis serine protease 1 (Bfp1) and show that it cleaves and activates PAR2 in multicellular and murine models. PAR2 cleavage by Bfp1 disrupts the intestinal barrier, sensitizes nociceptors, and triggers colonic inflammation and abdominal pain. Collectively, our findings uncover Bfp1-mediated PAR2 processing as an axis of host-commensal interaction in the gut that has the potential to be targeted for therapeutic intervention in IBD or IBS.

Abstract: Antioxidants are crucial in mitigating oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), contributing to chronic diseases and biomolecular damage. Beyond their biological significance, antioxidants are widely used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals to enhance stability and shelf life. Conventional detection methods—such as spectrophotometric assays (DPPH, ABTS, ORAC) and chromatographic techniques (HPLC, LC-MS)—are accurate but suffer from high costs, complex workflows, and limited portability. Biosensors offer a promising alternative, combining high sensitivity, rapid analysis, and real-time monitoring. Among these, metal-organic framework (MOFs) based biosensors stand out due to their tunable porosity, high surface area, and multifunctional design, enabling precise antioxidant detection via fluorescent, colorimetric, electrochemical, or hybrid mechanisms. These sensors achieve enhanced selectivity and signal amplification by integrating MOFs with various functional materials (e.g., graphene, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)) or biomimetic catalysts (nanozymes), even in complex matrices like biological fluids or food extracts. However, challenges remain in improving commercial applications’ selectivity, stability, and scalability. This review examines MOF-based biosensing platforms, their design strategies, and detection mechanisms while addressing key obstacles in transitioning from lab-scale to real-world deployment. By highlighting recent advances and unmet needs, we aim to guide the development of next-generation biosensors for antioxidant monitoring in clinical, industrial, and environmental settings.

Abstract: Aging in place, the concept of older individuals living independently within their communities, is gaining importance as the global population aged over 65 rises. Technology, particularly information and communication technology (ICT), plays a crucial role in supporting aging in place by enhancing safety and quality of life. Given Taiwan's strong research and development sector in ICT and the prevalence of aging in place, the case study is conducted in Taiwan. Content analysis of the interviews identified 16 key barriers, which were combined with those from the literature review. To systematically address these barriers and develop strategies, the study employed the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology, which involved establishing pairwise relationships among challenges with expert input. The study included 27 expert respondents, including physicians and scholars. This study found that User's Computer Literacy, Product Operation Complexity, Network Equipment Support, and Usage Safety Consideration require immediate attention. Therefore, older adults with an early educational background in computer literacy tend to adopt ICT more successfully. This study offers a hierarchical framework for overcoming barriers to ICT adoption among the elderly, enhancing elderly safety and supporting aging in place.

Abstract: This paper introduces the use of per-class regularization hyperparameters in Gabriel graph-based binary classifiers. We demonstrate how the quality index used for regularization behaves both in the margin region and in the presence of outliers, and how incorporating this regularization flexibility can lead to solutions that effectively eliminate outliers while training the classifier. We also show how it can address class imbalance by generating higher and lower thresholds for the majority and minority classes, respectively. Thus, rather than having a single solution based on fixed thresholds, flexible thresholds expand the solution space and can be optimized through hyperparameter tuning algorithms. Friedman test shows that flexible thresholds are capable of improving Gabriel graph-based classifiers.

Abstract: Human small heat shock protein B5 (HspB5) or αB-crystallin is essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis through its ATP-independent chaperone activity. Mutations in HspB5 have been recognized to be implicated in myopathies, cardiomyopathies, and cataracts; however, the structural and functional reasons for their pathogenicity remains poorly understood. The p.P51L mutation, located within the N-terminal domain critical for oligomerization and client recognition, has been associated with cardiomyopathy and cataracts. In this study, we generated the p.P51L variant using site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed the mutation using mass spectrometry. We employed spectroscopic, microscopic, NMR, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques to study the structural and functional consequences of this mutation. Our findings demonstrate that the p.P51L mutation induces alterations in secondary structures and conformation, accompanied by an increase in oligomer size and amyloid fibril formation. MD simulations also revealed enhanced structural stability and compactness in the mutant dimer, and lower binding affinity to the key client proteins, such as HspB4 (αA-crystallin) and desmin, suggesting a feasible mechanism of its association with cardiomyopathy and cataracts. These observations demonstrate how a point mutation can disrupt the conformational and functional properties of HspB5, its chaperone activity and client interactions. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of diseases related to HspB5 protein misfolding.

Abstract: The mitochondrion is the only organelle in animal cells with its own genome (mtDNA). Nevertheless, most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and are then imported into the mitochondria. Because animal mtDNA has an order of magnitude higher mutation rate compared to the nuclear genome, tight mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution is required to maintain mitochondrial function. Here we discuss three levels of such coevolution: protein-protein interaction within the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system; nuclear-encoded protein-mtDNA-encoded RNA interactions in the mitochondrial translation system; nuclear DNA-encoded protein-mtDNA binding site interactions as part of the mitochondrial transcription and replication machineries.

Abstract: Objective
Long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) regulates neurological damage in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) injury. The purpose of this study was to characterize the regulatory function of the LncRNA MAGI2 antisense RNA 3 (MAGI2-AS3) and explore its potential mechanism in CIR injury.
Methods
A rat middle cerebral artery occlusion/ischemia-reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was utilized. Neurological deficits and infarct volume were assessed using the mNSS and TTC staining. The levels of MAGI2-AS3 and microRNA (miR)-218-5p were quantified using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then, cell viability and apoptosis were determined via the Cell Count Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry. Oxidative stress indicators and the expression of neuroinflammatory factors were assessed via commercially available kits and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Finally, dual-luciferase reporter (DLR), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down assays confirmed the targeted interaction.
Results
MAGI2-AS3 was reduced in both MCAO/R and OGD/R models, accompanied by increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, as well as decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. OGD/R reduced cell viability and promoted apoptosis. However, MAGI2-AS3 overexpression mitigated these effects by partially reversing the significant increases in mNSS score, cerebral infarct volume, and brain water content, while also suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation. Mechanistically, MAGI2-AS3 targets miR-218-5p and represses its expression. Furthermore, miR-218-5p significantly weakened the protective effects of MAGI2-AS3 in MACO/R and OGD/R models.
Conclusion
MAGI2-AS3 was initially identified as a potential protective agent against circulatory CIR. It exerts neuroprotective effects by targeting miR-218-5p, thereby alleviating neurological damage caused by such injury.

Abstract: Background
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders by modulating neuronal circuits. However, the effects of electrical stimulation on the neurovascular unit remain poorly understood due to limitations of capturing microvascular changes near implanted leads. This motivated us to investigate the cardioballistic waveform (CBW) as an electrophysiological surrogate of vascular dynamics in response to microstimulation.
Methods
Microelectrode recordings (n = 193; 108 patients) were obtained during DBS implantation surgery from two electrodes (∼600 μm apart) before and after microstimulation through one electrode. Generalized linear mixed models assessed CBW amplitude changes following 1 Hz or 100 Hz stimulation across basal ganglia regions and white matter. Neuronal activity was also analyzed, including phase-locking to the cardiac cycle, firing rates and patterns, and micro-LFP features. An analytical model interpreted CBW amplitudes as pressure-driven vessel wall expansion, enabling estimation of stimulation-evoked vasodilation and cerebral blood flow.
Results
CBW amplitudes increased significantly after 100 Hz stimulation at the stimulating electrode, but not at the non-stimulating electrode or after 1 Hz stimulation. Significant region-specific effects were observed in the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim; 107 ± 13%), subthalamic nucleus (STN; 79 ± 7%), and globus pallidus internus (GPi; 78 ± 8%), but not in white matter (WM; 50 ± 14%) or substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr; 45 ± 8%). Across 50 recorded single units, 18 (36%) were phase-locked to the cardiac cycle, but stimulation did not alter phase-locking value, and changes in spiking or micro-LFP features before versus after stimulation did not scale with CBW changes. Modelling showed that the mean 88% CBW increase across Vim, STN, and GPi corresponds to an acute increase in cerebral blood flow.
Conclusion
CBW recordings reveal that high-frequency DBS evokes region-specific vascular responses which can be modelled as substantial increases in local blood flow, establishing CBW amplitude as a potential biomarker of subcortical hemodynamics, and a potential therapeutic modality.

Abstract: The circadian rhythm, regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus through a transcription-translation feedback loop, plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and optimizing physiological processes based on time of day. Recent studies have highlighted its role in cell survival under pathophysiological conditions. In this study, we explored the impact of the transcription factor Bmal1, a key clock protein, on ischemic brain injury by manipulating its expression through lentiviral vectors and Bmal1 knockout in mice exposed to 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 72 h or 42 days survival. Ischemic injury was evaluated alongside proteome analyses and Western blots in the acute stroke phase at 72 h post-ischemia/reperfusion. In the long-term phase, we examined neurogenesis, gliogenesis, angiogenesis, and brain atrophy at 42 days post-ischemia/reperfusion. Our results demonstrate that Bmal1 overexpression enhances neuronal survival and reduces cell injury in the ischemic brain, whereas Bmal1 knockdown or knockout has opposite effects. At the molecular level, Bmal1 was found to control key signaling pathways, including the master regulator mTOR in ischemic brain tissue. Proteome analyses by LC-MS/MS showed that Bmal1 potently regulated pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation, cell metabolism, neurodegeneration, and oxidative stress. In the long-term phase, Bmal1 overexpression was shown to promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis, while reducing gliogenesis and glial scar formation, thereby facilitating brain recovery. These findings suggest that Bmal1 plays a pivotal role in ischemic stroke recovery, positioning it as a potential target for stroke treatment.

Abstract: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent cells that have attracted considerable attention in regenerative medicine. Current in vitro test focus on biochemical assays of hair cell-like cells (HCLCs) derived from BMSCs associated with changes in electrophysiological properties. HCLCs were produced from BMSCs by culturing BMSCs with B27, EGF, FGF, and IGF-1. RNA Sequencing studies, immunocytochemistry (ICC) and double immunofluorescence staining were used to test hair cell-associated markers on day 17 and 21–26. Next, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording by utilizing current- and voltage-clamp techniques to assess changes in membrane potential and ionic currents during differentiation. Immunostaining assay reveals significant expression of myosin VIIA and SOX2 in cultured hair cells on day 21–26. We have also found 8 enhanced transcripts in differentiated cell genes (Wnt7a, Mgat5b, Myo7a, Pou4f3, SOX2, Atoh1, Map2k3, Actin) using RNA Sequencing. Electrophysiological results indicate that cells undergoing differentiation had an average resting membrane potential (RMP) of −11.93 ± 0.89 mV on day 17 and −58.96 ± 1.10 mV on days 21–26. Differentiated HCLCs displayed a mean resting membrane resistance of 171.66 ± 29.12 MΩ, membrane time constant of 10.73 ± 0.45 ms and membrane capacitance of 0.0625 ± 0.0087 pF, following 21–26 days in culture. Our results also showed cultured HCLCs express transcriptomic profile of this cell type. These findings indicate that alterations in RMP may serve as a valuable indicator for distinguishing HCLCs differentiation potential from BMSCs.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of membrane receptors and have attracted significant attention as pharmacological targets, and they represent the largest target class for many drugs used in the treatment of various diseases. One of the intriguing members of this family is G protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35), which belongs to the class A GPCR superfamily and is an orphan receptor. GPR35 has been shown to be expressed in many organ-tissue systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, immune system, and central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, its association with the progression of pathophysiological diseases in these organ-tissue systems is not surprising. Accumulating evidence has implicated GPR35 in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Additionally, GPR35 has been demonstrated to be involved in depression-like behaviours induced by inflammation in mice. Despite these findings, the precise mechanisms by which GPR35 contributes to the pathogenesis of depression remain unclear. In this article, we highlight the structure, widespread expression, and endogenous ligands of GPR35, as well as its role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, particularly in depression. In addition, we explored the role of GPR35 agonists and antagonists in the antidepressant mechanism, expanding the potential therapeutic value of GPR35 in depression. In summary, GPR35 has shown clear preclinical potential in the treatment of depression, which will provide a theoretical basis for accelerating its translation from the laboratory to the clinic, holding promise as a new breakthrough in the treatment of mental disorders.

Abstract: Climate change necessitates precise solar forecasting due to its weather-dependent intermittency. Key parameters - temperature, visibility, altitude, pressure, and wind speed - were analyzed using non-parametric tests. We prioritized short-term weather patterns over random data splitting for enhanced accuracy.Non-parametric tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, were used to assess data normality and select highly correlated features. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces dataset dimensionality while preserving critical trends. Various machine learning approaches were evaluated, including: weighted linear regression (both with and without dimensionality reduction), boosted regression trees, and deep learning architectures-comprising both fundamental models (Convolutional Neural Networks [CNNs] and Recurrent Neural Networks [RNNs]) and advanced hybrid architectures (Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory network (CNN-LSTM). All models were optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive performance, reduce computational complexity, and improve learning convergence rates. Special attention was given to addressing vanishing gradient problems in deep neural network implementations. Results show TCN outperform other deep learning models, achieving lower training and testing errors with fewer parameters and reduced time complexity. CNN-LSTM models, designed for spatial-sequence prediction, perform well but require more parameters and computational time. The lowest test and training errors belong to CNN-LSTM and TCN, with approximately 9 % and 2 % lower than the maximum amount, respectively. A trade-off between model complexity, error rates, and computational efficiency must be considered when selecting the optimal approach. Since relevant weather features vary by location, the proposed methodology serves as an adaptable algorithm for solar energy prediction in diverse geographical regions.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and abnormal protein aggregation. The silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) family of proteins, known as sirtuins (SIRT1 - SIRT7), are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone deacetylases that regulate important signal transduction pathways in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. An increasing number of studies revealed that sirtuins play diverse roles in cellular homeostasis, such as metabolic regulation, oxidative stress response, apoptosis, organelle protection, and gene stability. Intriguingly, growing evidence suggests that sirtuins may serve as pivotal molecular mediators in PD, yet a comprehensive synthesis of their roles in this disorder is lacking. Although the precise pathogenesis of PD remains unmapped, identifying common molecular nodes could offer effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we present the first systematic integration of current knowledge on the distinct contributions of individual sirtuins to PD pathophysiology offering promising molecular targets for the treatment of PD. Unlike previous studies focusing on isolated aspects of sirtuin biology, our work uniquely consolidates the multifaceted mechanisms by which sirtuins modulate PD, offering a holistic perspective on their therapeutic potential. We underscore the transformative potential of sirtuin modulation, positioning a promising and unexplored frontier in neurodegenerative disease therapy. This work aims to provide new insights into potential sirtuin-targeted therapy of PD.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and pathological accumulation of p-α-Synuclein (p-α-Syn). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as a regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, yet its role in PD pathology remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of AMPK activation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in an MPTP-induced PD mouse model. In both undifferentiated and retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), pharmacological AMPK activation with AICAR reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and p-α-Syn aggregation. These effects were associated with enhanced mitophagy, increased lysosomal degradation, and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, collectively restoring mitochondrial integrity and improving dopaminergic features. In vivo, AICAR treatment attenuated nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in MPTP-exposed mice, reduced p-α-Syn accumulation, and preserved tyrosine hydroxylase expression. Moreover, systemic cytokine analysis revealed that AMPK activation suppressed IL-6–mediated inflammation, while modulating IL-1β levels in a context-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that AMPK activation mitigates α-synuclein pathology, preserves mitochondrial function, and protects dopaminergic neurons in both cellular and animal PD models. Our findings support AMPK as a potential therapeutic target for disease modification in PD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two pathological hallmarks: extracellular β-amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by aggregated Tau protein. Ongoing research focuses on identifying inhibitors that either block Tau aggregation or destabilize pre-formed fibrils. In this study, we evaluated derivatives of Rhodanine (RDN), Anthraquinone (AQ), Phenylaminopyrimidine (PhNH2), Phenylthiazol hydrazide (PTH) and Benzothiazole (BZT) as potential modulators of Tau aggregation. We synthesized target compounds using Pd- and Cu-catalyzed coupling reactions and confirmed their structures via NMR spectroscopy. Thioflavin T fluorescence assays and 1H15N Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) NMR experiments demonstrated that PhNH2 and PTH effectively inhibited Tau polymerization by interacting with key hexapeptide motifs. Additionally, AQ, RDN, and PhNH2 reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression in LPS-stimulated monocytes, underscoring their anti-inflammatory activity. These findings suggest PhNH2 and PTH as promising candidates for modulating Tau aggregation, with PhNH2 exhibiting dual anti-aggregation and anti-inflammatory properties.

Abstract: Adult spinal deformity remains a complex challenge with medical and surgical complication rates post-operatively reported to be around 40 %. Patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are particularly susceptible to musculoskeletal disease secondary to postural deformity, muscle rigidity, and bradykinesia and have an increased risk of spinal deformity compared to the general population. There is a paucity of literature investigating the outcomes of multi-level spinal deformity surgery in this at-risk population. Patients undergoing multi-level posterior spinal fusion for spinal deformity with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease were identified using the PearlDiver database. Patients with PD were propensity-matched in a 1:1 ratio to a control group by age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI). Medical complications and rates of surgical site infection (SSI) were assessed at 90 days. Surgical revision rates were assessed at 2 years. A total of 2776 patients met criteria with 1,388 patients in the PD group and 1,388 in the control group after propensity matching. Patients with PD had a significantly higher rate of surgical revision at 2 years and an increased risk of 90-day medical complications post-operatively. There was no difference in infection rates between groups within 90 days. Patients with Parkinson’s Disease undergoing multilevel posterior spinal fusion for spinal deformity correction have an increased risk of medical complications and need for surgical revision compared to age and comorbidity matched controls. Non-operative management should be exhausted prior to surgical treatment and further research is needed to optimize outcomes in this high-risk patient population.

Abstract: We undertook the rational design and synthesis of a novel series of ligands intended to function as selective dual dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) partial agonists and D3 receptor (D3R) antagonists. The molecular architecture of these compounds was derived by integrating key pharmacophoric features from established D1R partial agonists and D3R antagonists. Specifically, the 6-(2-methylphenyl)-1,5-dimethylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione scaffold was employed as the core “tail” region associated with D1R partial agonism, while various substituted phenyl piperazine moieties were introduced as “head” groups to confer D3R antagonistic activity. A pyridine ring was utilized as a central linker across the series. Contrary to the intended dopaminergic profile, these compounds exhibited markedly higher binding affinities for α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) relative to their activity at dopamine receptor subtypes. Several analogues demonstrated potent α2C-AR binding affinities in the low nanomolar range (Ki = 7–30 nM), with moderate selectivity (up to 17-fold) over other α2-AR subtypes. Notably, compounds bearing ortho-substituted aryl groups within the “head” domain generally displayed enhanced α2C-AR binding compared to their para-substituted counterparts. Molecular docking studies conducted at both α2A-AR and α2C-AR suggested that multiple receptor-ligand interactions contribute to the observed binding profiles. In particular, an anion–pi interaction between Asp131 of α2C-AR and the phenyl ring of the phenyl piperazine “head” moiety was identified as a possible determinant of the increased α2C-AR affinity observed in ortho-substituted analogues.

Abstract: Flexible chemiresistive gas sensors are gaining significant attention due to their transformative applications in wearable health monitoring, environmental sensing, and industrial safety. Their ability to operate at room temperature, low cost, high sensitivity, low power consumption, simple fabrication, and ease of data retraction make them ideal for integration into smart textiles, e-skins, and portable devices, enabling real-time monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gases, and biomarkers. These sensors are poised to revolutionize personalized healthcare, pollution detection, and workplace safety, with applications ranging from point-of-care diagnostics to continuous environmental monitoring. Advancements in innovative designs incorporating highly responsive and functional materials—such as two-dimensional materials, conducting polymers, and hybrid nanocomposites—have significantly enhanced the performance of these gas sensors. However, integrating sensitive and conductive materials onto flexible substrates presents challenges in maintaining structural integrity and performance under environmental stress. Thus, surface modification techniques are pivotal in overcoming flexible substrate limitations—such as low surface energy, thermal mismatch, porosity, hydrophilicity, etc. while countering practical constraints like humidity, temperature and mechanical stress. Methods like plasma treatment and UV-ozone enhance surface energy and adhesion; sol-gel ensures uniform functional coatings; and CVD/ALD provide precise, conformal layers. Collectively, these strategies improve film uniformity, sensing response, and long-term mechanical and environmental reliability, making them essential for robust, scalable sensor development. The review also highlights scalable fabrication methods such as inkjet, screen, and roll-to-roll printing for precise, cost-effective sensor manufacturing. By overcoming substrate challenges and leveraging advanced treatments and printing strategies, this work presents a roadmap for developing robust, eco-friendly, and high-performance flexible gas sensors.

Abstract: Chitosan–graphene oxide (CS–GO) nanocomposites have been investigated as hybrid platforms for drug delivery because they combine the biodegradability of chitosan with the high surface functionality of graphene oxide. However, their clinical translation is still at an early stage, and a systematic overview of their design strategies and biological performance is needed. Publications were classified according to carrier responsiveness to pH, redox environments, and near-infrared (NIR) light, as well as approaches for co-delivery of multiple agents. Reported findings indicate that CS–GO systems can improve drug loading efficiency and enable controlled release, although results vary depending on fabrication method, surface modification, and drug type. Applications have been explored in cancer treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and delivery to tissues such as bone, brain, and the gastrointestinal tract. In vitro and in vivo studies generally demonstrate therapeutic potential, but limitations such as incomplete toxicity evaluation, lack of standardized synthesis protocols, and variability in biological outcomes remain major obstacles. Unlike other chitosan-based nanocarriers, the application of artificial intelligence in CS–GO design is still limited and has not been systematically assessed. Overall, this review synthesizes current knowledge, identifies gaps between experimental findings and translational requirements, and highlights directions for future work, including long-term safety assessment, reproducible large-scale fabrication, and integration with computational optimization tools.

Abstract: The integration of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and nanozymes has proven to be a highly effective strategy in bioanalytical applications, owing to its superior capabilities in signal transduction and amplification. Nevertheless, clinical applications still face obstacles, particularly in achieving sufficient selectivity. In this work, we have presented a SERS strategy for the selective detection of dopamine in human urine with MOF-818 which exhibits selective catechol oxidase-like activities. AgNPs@MOF-818 catalyze the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) to diaminobenzazine (DAP) molecules, when dopamine (DA) is present, the oxidation of OPD is inhibited while DA is catalyzed into o-quinones, thereby suppressing the SERS signal intensity. An indirect SERS detection strategy of dopamine with high sensitivity and selectivity was established. The catechol oxidase-like activity of MOF-818 provides ideal selectivity to dopamine, while the OPD-dopamine catalytic system induces significant changes in SERS intensity. The detection protocol was subsequently optimized to achieve high sensitivity for dopamine, yielding a linear response range of 0.1–30 μmol/L and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.04 μmol/L. The method was successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of dopamine in human urine samples, demonstrating excellent recovery rates and minimal relative error in comparison with results obtained by commercial dopamine ELISA kit. This strategy presents a cost-effective, efficient, and accurate approach for dopamine detection while delivering insights into the integration of selective multifunctional nanozymes with sensitive SERS technique.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of refractory painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), although the current evidence for efficacy is limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up. We aimed to assess the benefits of SCS, compared to combination pharmacotherapy (gabapentinoid plus duloxetine), in a large population of PDN patients using real-world evidence.
Methods
We performed a real-world cohort study of electronic medical records using the TriNetX network, a global federated database (9th September 2024). The treatment arm was patients with PDN (defined as diabetes plus neuropathic pain treatment) treated with SCS (refractory to pharmacotherapy), compared against a reference arm of patients treated with gabapentinoid and duloxetine combination therapy. We propensity score matched (1:1) for confounders with 3 years of follow-up. The primary outcome was time-to incident major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, that is, a composite outcome of non-fatal ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular accident or heart failure, or sudden cardiac death) and secondary outcomes included time-to all-cause mortality, below-knee amputation (BKA), suicide (suicidal ideation and/or attempt), staphylococcus aureus infection, major adverse kidney events (end stage renal failure and/or dialysis), diabetes-related ophthalmic disease (retinopathy and/or maculopathy), hospitalisation and SCS explantation. All outcomes were assessed using ICD-10/CPT codes. Stratified analyses assessed the impact of sex, ethnicity, age, geographic location (USA) and discontinuation of analgesia post SCS implantation on these outcomes.
Findings
We identified 145,380 patients, with 3212 treated with SCS and 142,168 treated with dual pharmacotherapy alone. After PSM, 3105 patients were included in each arm. Treatment with SCS significantly reduced the risk of MACE (hazard ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.49, 0.67]), all-cause mortality (0.49 [0.39, 0.62]), BKA amputation (0.19 [0.08, 0.46]), suicide (0.36 [0.22, 0.59]), staphylococcus aureus infection (0.67 [0.51, 0.90]), MAKE (0.46 [0.27, 0.79]), diabetes-related ophthalmic disease (0.33 [0.23, 0.48]) and hospitalisation (0.59 [0.53, 0.66]), compared with combination pharmacotherapy. 11.1% of SCS patients underwent explant. Female and older patients had greater reductions in BKA and infection with SCS, whilst the associated reduced risk of suicide was most prominent in younger adults.
Interpretation
Our results suggest that SCS treatment of PDN is associated with a reduced risk of MACE, all-cause mortality, major amputation, suicide, and staphylococcus aureus infection. The findings provide evidence for the putative benefits of SCS as treatment for PDN. Prospective sham controlled RCTs with pain endpoint whilst incorporating longer term follow-up of CV/mortality outcomes are needed to confirm the benefits and explore cost-effectiveness of SCS.
