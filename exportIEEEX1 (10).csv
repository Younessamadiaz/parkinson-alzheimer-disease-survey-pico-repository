Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly affects motor functions, including gait, leading to shuffling steps, festinating gait, and freezing of gait. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial, as timely intervention can mitigate disease progression. This paper presents an ensemble learning approach to improve early recognition of PD through gait analysis. We construct a dataset of over 2,000 samples from both PD patients and healthy controls, utilizing 6-axis Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to capture gait metrics. An adaptive ensemble learning model, incorporating five different classifiers, is trained on this dataset, achieving an F1 score of 96.54% and an accuracy of 96.61% in distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls.","","979-8-3315-1709-0","10.1109/ACAIT63902.2024.11022046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11022046","ensemble learning;gait analysis;inertial measurement units (IMUs);parkinson's disease;sixth-Generation communication technology (6G)","6G mobile communication;Adaptation models;Measurement units;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Refining;Inertial navigation;Communications technology;Ensemble learning;Gait recognition","","","","10","IEEE","10 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the early stages, symptoms are mild and patients may ignore their existence. As a result, they do not undergo any related clinical examination; hence delaying their PD diagnosis. In an effort to remedy such delay, analysis of data passively captured from user's interaction with consumer technologies has been recently explored towards remote screening of early PD motor signs. In the current study, a smartphone-based method analyzing subjects' finger interaction with the smartphone screen is developed for the quantification of fine-motor skills decline in early PD using Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results from the analysis of keystroke typing in-the-clinic data from 18 early PD patients and 15 healthy controls have shown a classification performance of 0.89 Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 0.79/0.79 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. Evaluation of the generalization ability of the proposed approach was made by its application on typing data arising from a separate self-reported cohort of 27 PD patients' and 84 healthy controls' daily usage with their personal smartphones (data in-the-wild), achieving 0.79 AUC with 0.74/0.78 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. The results show the potentiality of the proposed approach to process keystroke dynamics arising from users' natural typing activity to detect PD, which contributes to the development of digital tools for remote pathological symptom screening.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8857211","","Keyboards;Pipelines;Parkinson's disease;Convolutional neural networks;Tools;Monitoring","Early Diagnosis;Humans;Motor Skills;Neural Networks, Computer;Parkinson Disease;Sensitivity and Specificity;Smartphone;User-Computer Interface","17","","13","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461555","FAU Emerging Fields Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7169494","Wearable technologies;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;knowledge discovery;patients;Internet of things (IoT);knowledge discovery;parkinson's disease (PD);patients;wearable technologies","Parkinson's disease;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of things;Wearable sensors","Cell Phone;Humans;Internet;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine","272","","112","IEEE","28 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its main clinical manifestations are a variety of movement disorders, including abnormal gait, which seriously affect the performance of motor function, leading to shaking hands at rest, bradykinesia, myotonia, and difficulty in maintaining postural balance. The current work focuses on the methods of wearable devices and non-wearable devices to evaluate sports injuries. However, the network models based on the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) to quantify the severity of Parkinson's disease injuries have problems such as incomplete generalization of input features, insufficient feature extraction of network models, and imbalance between recognition accuracy and model size. A lightweight and high-precision convolutional neural network model is essential for accurate and quantitative assessment of disease progression and for slowing or preventing further disease progression. Regarding the above issues, we use a computer vision-based model to observe video recordings of the human body, extract their 3D body skeletons, track them through time, and input them into our proposed a Triple-feature Triple-motion Convolutional Neural Network (PE-TTNET) with Positional encoding for training. We position encode the triple scale features and classify the gait severity of PD patients based on MDS-UPDRS. The experimental results indicate that PE-TTNET achieved better results compared to previous network models in testing the clinical dataset we collected, with higher Fl-score and average accuracy in classifying the severity level of Parkinson's disease.","","979-8-3503-1452-6","10.1109/AINIT59027.2023.10212599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212599","Convolutional Neural Network;3D body skeletons;Parkinson's disease","Three-dimensional displays;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Wearable computers;Feature extraction;Bones;Encoding","","1","","14","IEEE","21 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ideally, identification is the best practice for control and intervention; nevertheless, traditional approaches used in diagnosing may fail to detect the disease during its early stage. This paper aims to determine whether DBNs are suitable for detecting PD early since they can assess complicated and high-dimensional medical information. During the DBN modelling, the data used here were trained and tested using publicly available datasets, and the accuracy level recorded was 92 percent. In comparison, the sensitivity was 90 percent, and the specificity was 94 percent. The ROC-AVC of the timing of task execution was calculated to be 0. 95 percent in the diagnostic capacity, which indeed indicates the high level had been maintained. According to the above results, the DBN model provided superior performance to other diagnostic methods, which include a low false-negative rate. Traditional techniques, where the diagnosis depends on a doctor's assignment and imaging techniques, are usually less accurate and take more time to detect diseases early. It is crucial to note that this research proves the DBN model's feature of recognizing little deviations that hint at early-stage Parkinson's disease, making for a robust and practical diagnostic application.

The prototype has been developed using a triboelectric sensor based on Ecoflex™ and PEDOT:PSS that is placed on the forearm. The movement of the skin above the forearm muscles and tendons correlates with the extension and flexion of fingers and hands. This way, the small gap of 0.5 cm between the polymer layers is displaced, generating voltage due to the triboelectric contact. Signals from preliminary experiments can discriminate different dynamics of emulated tremor and bradykinesia in hands and fingers. A modified version of the TS is integrated with a printed circuit board (PCB) in a single package with signal conditioning and wireless data transmission.

Unlike our previous works and the majority of the published studies, where UPDRS tasks were the sole focus, in this paper, we carry out a comparative investigation of the LA, S2S, and G tasks.

We analyzed the performance achieved by the automatic UPDRS scoring system and compared the estimated UPDRS evaluation with the one performed by neurologists, showing that the proposed system compares favorably with typical interrater variability. We then investigated the correlations between the UPDRS scores assigned to the various tasks by both the neurologists and the automatic system. The results, based on a limited number of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) (34 patients, 47 clinical trials), show poor-to-moderate correlations between the UPDRS scores of different tasks, highlighting that the patients' motor performance may vary significantly from one task to another, since different tasks relate to different aspects of the disease. An aggregate UPDRS score is also considered as a concise parameter, which can provide additional information on the overall level of the motor impairments of a Parkinson's patient.

Wearable sensors have been demonstrated to help overcoming such a difficulty, by providing objective measures of motor abnormalities. However, up to now, those sensors have been used on advanced PD patients with evident motor impairment. As a novelty, here we report the impact of wearable sensors in the evaluation of motor abnormalities in newly diagnosed, untreated, namely de novo, patients. Methods: A network of wearable sensors was used to measure motor capabilities, in 30 de novo PD patients and 30 healthy subjects, while performing five motor tasks. Measurement data were used to determine motor features useful to highlight impairments and were compared with the corresponding clinical scores. Three classifiers were used to differentiate PD from healthy subjects. Results: Motor features gathered from wearable sensors showed a high degree of significance in discriminating the early untreated de novo PD patients from the healthy subjects, with 95% accuracy. The rates of severity obtained from the measured features are partially in agreement with the clinical scores, with some highlighted, though justified, exceptions. Conclusion: Our findings support the feasibility of adopting wearable sensors in the detection of motor anomalies in early, untreated, PD patients. Significance: This work demonstrates that subtle motor impairments, occurring in de novo patients, can be evidenced by means of wearable sensors, providing clinicians with instrumental tools as suitable supports for early diagnosis, and subsequent management.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2903627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8662663","IMU;machine learning;motion analysis;parkinson's disease;signal processing;wearable technology","Task analysis;Wearable sensors;Biomedical measurement;Parkinson's disease;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","Accelerometry;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;Machine Learning;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Physiologic;Movement;Parkinson Disease;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wearable Electronic Devices","63","","54","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This will enhance quality of life (QoL) in PD through improved self-monitoring and also provide information that could be shared with a healthcare provider to help better manage treatment. Until recently, nonmotor symptoms (“soft signs”) had been generally overlooked in clinical management, yet these are of primary importance to patients and their QoL. Day-to-day variability of the condition, the high variability in symptoms between patients, and the isolated snapshots of a patient in periodic clinic visits make better monitoring essential to the proper management of PD. Continuously monitored patterns of activity, social interactions, and daily activities could provide a rich source of information on status changes, guiding self-correction and clinical management. The same tools can be useful in earlier detection of PD and will improve clinical studies. Remote medical communications in the form of telemedicine, sophisticated tracking of medication use, and assistive technologies that directly compensate for disease-related challenges are examples of other near-term technology solutions to PD problems. Ultimately, a sensor technology is not good if it is not used.

To address this issue, we employ sensor systems to collect tremor parameters from PD patients and analyzed these collected data using traditional machine learning algorithms, providing an objective and quantitative diagnosis for PD. To obtain more comprehensive features, this study adopts the PKG wearable device to extract 12 tremor features from 100 PD patients, along with recording 9 scale-based features and 3 demographic characteristics. Furthermore, to overcome the issues of low accuracy and poor generalization ability of traditional machine learning methods, we propose a capsule network integrated with a self-attention mechanism (SA-CapsNet) for classifying and predicting early stage and moderate to advanced stage stage PD patients. We also utilize the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve the model's ability to generalize. Lastly, The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model is introduced to improve the interpretability of the predictive model, and feature analysis is conducted to identify the main factors influencing classification and prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the SA-CapsNet method for PD can achieve an accuracy of 92.31%, precision of 82.19%, recall of 91.23%, specificity of 80.00%, and an F1 score of 85.25%.

Machine learning approaches, including algorithms like SVM, DNN, and random forests, show promise in detecting subtle changes indicative of PD onset, especially when combined with wearable technologies. These methods face challenges such as overfitting, generalization, and interpretability. The paper compares the methods based on accuracy, cost, and practicality, aiming to guide future research and development in PD early detection. Here These features are analyzed using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to classify the input and detect early signs of Parkinson's. The system provides immediate feedback via an LCD screen connected to an Arduino microcontroller, offering real-time results.","","979-8-3315-3638-1","10.1109/ICITIIT64777.2025.11040662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11040662","SVM;Neural Networks;Parkinson's Disease (PD);ML Algorithm","Neuroimaging;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Brain modeling;Data models;Real-time systems;Biomedical monitoring;Wearable sensors","","","","17","IEEE","27 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Pull Test is the most common clinical examination to assess postural instability in PD. However, the subjectivity and low discriminative power of this test presents as a major drawback. In this paper we propose a novel methodology to estimate the Pull Test scores from patients with PD. We capture the relationship between the Pull Test outcomes and patients' foot motion patterns, using wearable sensors mounted on their shoes. 139 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients performed four motor function tests, including walking and repetitive foot motions, while acceleration and orientation data was recorded. A total of 684 features were extracted from the acceleration and orientation signals. Feature selection and classification algorithms were utilized to estimate the Pull Test score for each participant. Further, we estimate which motor function test would better predict the Pull Test score, depending on the patient's phenotype (i.e. bradykinetic, tremor-dominant or equivalent). When combining all phenotypes and all tests, the mean of the classification probability distribution achieved was 0.75 (CI: [0.69 – 0.82]). Foot circling was the best predictive test for the equivalent patients (mean = 0.79, CI: [0.69 – 0.87]) and the bradykinetic patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64 – 0.85]), while 2×10 m. walk with stop-and-go proved superior for the tremor-dominant patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64 – 0.85]). Overall, these results suggest that inertial data from patient's foot motion can be used to estimate postural instability in PD patients.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7319050","","Parkinson's disease;Feature extraction;Foot;Chlorine;Frequency measurement;Accuracy;Acceleration","Algorithms;Databases as Topic;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Physiology;Probability","15","","18","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we present a new approach that combines the assessment of CNN deep learning models and RF in diagnosing PD based on neuroimages and clinical information. CNN provides feature extraction capability, while RF provides classification capacity, and the model combines these two characteristics, leading to high diagnostic performance. The proposed approach is then evaluated on an available real dataset, which includes MRI images and other clinical features like motor UPDRS scores, cognitive test results, age, and gender, and the experimental outcomes are reported. Based on the authors' experimental findings, the hybrid CNN-RF model produced the highest accuracy of 93 %. 7% outperforming CNN and RF standalone models with accuracies of 88. 4% and 85. The model also erected a high sensitivity of 94. 2 % and a specificity of 92. 8% provided a reliable model for differentiating PD cases and the control group. The first metric is ROC with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of0. 96, hence adding to the confirmation of the workability of the model when discriminating between the classes. The assessments of motor UPDRS scores suggested that they were essential predictors of PD and that specific brain regions revealed by the CNN were also important indicators of PD. Although the model can achieve high accuracy, this paper has shown the limitations of relying on labelled data.

This information can be perceived by computational systems. In this work, we show that early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is possible solely from the voice signal. This is in contrast to earlier work in which we showed that this can be done using hand-calculated features of the speech (such as formants) as annotated by professional speech therapists. In this paper, we review that work and show that a differential diagnosis can be produced directly from the analog speech signal itself. In addition, differentiation can be made between seven different degrees of progression of the disease (including healthy). Such a system can act as an additional stage (or another building block) in a bigger system of natural speech processing. For example it could be used in automatic speech recognition systems that are used as personal assistants (such as Iphones' Siri, Google Voice), or as natural man-machine interfaces. We also conjecture that such systems can be extended to monitoring and classifying additional neurological diseases and speech pathologies.

In this paper, the gait of two healthy individuals and three patients with PD is compared using a radar network to determine which gait parameters are more determinant to detect PD. This effect is quantified for three different gait paces. The results show that the mean and maximum stride times when the subjects walk at their regular pace are the most determinant to detect PD.

A person with PD manifests PD-related symptoms. The condition slows down movement, affects speech, and the ability to perform a task, and writing becomes time-consuming for a person suffering from it. The prevalence of PD is 1-2 per 1000 people at any time. Parkinson's Disease cases rise with age and affect 1% of those over the age of 60. Even in this day and age, despite the numerous technological developments and advancements that have been made, the process of early disease detection is still challenging to achieve. As a result of this, it is important to develop automatic methods that are based on machine learning and that assist clinicians in accurately identifying this disease in its early phases. Literature supports the link between Parkinson's disease and the cardiovascular system. In research, the main objective is to establish the correlation between PD and heart disease by using a Machine learning algorithm named Extreme Gradient Boosting. The experiments were run utilizing python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit Learn.

This impairment of neurons leads to a decrease in dopamine production, which is the primary cause of Parkinson's disease. PD impairs motor functions and hinders cognitive and emotional stability, noticeably degrading the patient's quality of life. While PD remains incurable, proper diagnosis, early detection, and timely medication can assist PD patients in their healthier aging. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals represent the brain's electrical activity and provide critical insights into neural activities. Existing methods in deep learning necessitate manual feature extraction, which requires domain expertise. Hence, this work represents an automated hybrid CNN-BiLSTM neural network architecture that predicts Parkinson's disease using rest-EEG signals. First, we design three 1–D CNN layers to extract the spatiotemporal relationship across the EEG channels. Subsequently, we utilize BiLSTM to identify temporal characteristics relevant to classifying these spatiotemporal features. The study utilizes EEG recordings from two open-access datasets: the University of Mexico (UNM) EEGs and the University of California San Diego (UCSD) resting state EEGs.

Machine learning (ML) can be used to detect Parkinson's disease by analyzing patterns in data, such as hand drawings. In this paper, the unique learning model (ULM) used for hand drawings to detect PD; a dataset would need to be collected containing drawings from both people with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. The dataset should be large enough to ensure that the machine learning algorithm can accurately distinguish between the two groups. Once the dataset is collected, a machine learning algorithm can be trained to classify the drawings as either Parkinson's or healthy. The machine learning algorithm would need to be trained on the dataset using features extracted from the hand drawings, such as the size and shape of certain parts of the drawing, the angle of the lines, and the smoothness of the lines. These features would be used to create a model that can accurately distinguish between Parkinson's and healthy hand drawings. The performance of the model analyzed by a separate testing dataset would be used, containing hand drawings from both groups. The model would be evaluated on this dataset to determine its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics can be used to assess how well the model is able to distinguish between Parkinson's and healthy hand drawings. Overall, using ULM to detect PD from dataset has the potential to be a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible method for early detection of the disease.","","979-8-3503-0085-7","10.1109/ICSSAS57918.2023.10331854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10331854","Parkinson's disease;unique learning model (ULM);support vector machines (SVMs);random forests;neural networks (NN)","Support vector machines;Measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Shape;Medical services;Predictive models","","1","","18","IEEE","6 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis is an important tool for studying dynamic changes in brain functional activity. This study explores the pathophysiological changes in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients by analyzing the EEG microstate of PD patients, and analyzes the impact of rTMS on the clinical symptoms of PD patients. In a trial, 25 patients with PD and 18 healthy subjects of the same age were included. The clinical scale (the third part of Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) scores of each patient were evaluated and the microstate characteristic parameters of all subjects were calculated. 10 Hz rTMS was used to stimulate the bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) of PD patients. After two weeks of treatment (10 times), the clinical scale score of each patient was re-evaluated and the microstate characteristic parameters were calculated. At the baseline, the occurrence, duration and coverage of microstate C in PD patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P <0.05),and were significantly negatively correlated with the MoCA score (P <0.05). The duration and coverage of microstate D in PD patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls (P <0.05), and were significantly negatively correlated with UPDRS-III score (P <0.05). After rTMS treatment in the PD group, the scale score of UPDRS-III was significantly reduced (P <0.05) and the scale score of MoCA was significantly increased. Moreover, the occurrence and coverage of microstate B were significantly increased (p <0.05). The occurrence, duration and coverage of microstate C were significantly reduced (P <0.05). The occurrence, duration and coverage of microstate D were significantly increased (P <0.05). This study shows that abnormal brain functional activity of PD patients can change microstate characteristic parameters, and these changes are significantly related to the decline of motor and cognitive functions. Furthermore, rTMS can improve the motor and cognitive functions and adjust the microstate characteristic parameters of PD patients. EEG microstate analysis can reflect the therapeutic effect of rTMS on PD patients.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3418846","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52320105008,51877067); Key Research and Development Project of Hebei Province(grant numbers:21372002D); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10570451","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation;Parkinson’s disease;EEG;microstate analysis","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Diseases;Surfaces;Voltage;Motors;Parkinson's disease","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Male;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation;Female;Electroencephalography;Middle Aged;Aged;Motor Cortex","6","","50","CCBY","25 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These nerve cells die or become damaged, resulting in a loss of ability to produce an important chemical called dopamine. Currently, there is no any cure for this disorder and also no way to reverse the condition. Therefore, it is very essential to identify the presence of disease at its initial stage rather than allowing it to develop into a more lethal threat. In order to predict the Parkinson's in its earlier stage, we have developed an efficient machine learning model using Random Forest and XGBoost classifier algorithms. The model is trained with the help of data collected from various hospitals with the help of neurologists. To predict whether the individual is affected by PD or healthy, we use a videocam to monitor the individual and SensorTile - sensor node, which contains accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer incorporated on a board with built-in transmitter. All the data are transmitted in real-time and stored in a PC for data analysis. With the data collected from the individual, the trained ML model is evaluated and the disease can be detected on comparison with threshold value. If PD is detected, the patient is provided with a wearable glove which aids in performing their day-to-day tasks.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10099917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099917","Bluetooth;Disease Prediction;Healthcare;Machine Learning;Parkinson;Sensors;Videocam","Parkinson's disease;Transmitters;Neurons;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Real-time systems","","4","","22","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It causes thoughts to arise in the mind, produces responses, and makes it possible for body parts to move. It further controls additional functions, including digestion and breathing. This nervous system is made up of billions of cells that can translate the information received by sensory organs into actions carried out by body parts. However, as we get older, these cells begin to die, which causes the amount of the dopamine compound to decrease. This causes unexpected progression in the movement of the body parts, which is known as Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the disease is very challenging to cure but its production can be decelerated with early prediction. In this work, five machine learning models namely, random forest, decision tree, linear regression, naive bayes, and logistic regression have been used for the early PD diagnosis. For the implementation of the model, the dataset has been collected from Kaggle containing the normal cases and PD patients. The results have depicted that random forest models outperform with an accuracy rate of 86.24%, however, the naive shows the least accuracy value of 73.94%. Furthermore, the work can be helpful in diagnosing the active cases of PD in real-time medical treatment if enabled by the healthcare departments.

Machine learning based approach has been used in many cases of Parkinson's disease using gait data as well as voice data. However, so far no body ha s compared the performance metrics using different feature sets by applying non-linear based classification approach based on the voice data.

Numerous initiatives have been made throughout the years to effectively diagnose Parkinson's disease automatically. For analysis and detection, a variety of datasets have been used, counting voice data samples, radiological pictures, gait specimens and handwriting samples. Widespread usage of methods like deep learning and machine learning has produced encouraging outcomes. The ageing neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease (PD) impairs both cognitive as well as motor function. Although the cause of PD is largely understood, genetic factors and environmental conditions are probably concerned. In contrast, the pathophysiology of Parkinson Disease at the network level is quite well characterized. The motor manifestations of PD treatment can be effective with several medicines. Additionally, simulation of deep brain activity is frequently used to indulge in medication-resistant Parkinson's disease (DBS). Despite DBS's effectiveness in treating Parkinson's, nothing is learned about how it functions. Worldwide, several millions of people get affected with this PD. Around 1% of persons over 60 have Parkinson's disease, and as people get older, their symptoms get worse. Patients may suffer irregularities in speech and voice that may go unnoticed by listeners but that can be examined utilizing recorded speech signals. Because of the enormous technological breakthroughs, there is a need to use data mining andmachine learning methods to extract scientific understanding from the vast amounts of medical data that have been generated.

Although there is no known cause or cure, it is possible to manage symptoms with treatment. PD affects about 7 million people worldwide and is projected to reach 10 million by 2030. Recent studies have explored protein and peptide levels as potential PD biomarkers that could impact Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. In this research paper, we analyze data from 1,019 patients to predict the UPDRS score based on biomarkers. We leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning to identify changes in protein and peptide levels that could serve as useful PD risk biomarkers. These analytical techniques utilize protein and peptide levels from general health screenings of patients for early PD detection to uncover patterns and correlations that enable accurate predictive models for UPDRS. This helps in the early detection of PD, allowing effective management and intervention. Our results show that several proteins and peptides are associated with PD risk. These proteins and peptides have a deep impact on the UPDRS score. We also find that the levels of these proteins and peptides are higher in people with PD than in healthy individuals. Finally, we obtain Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) scores from various machine learning algorithms to measure the accuracy of predictions. Analysis with SMAPE reveals the superiority of Random Forest as the best-performing machine learning technique for PD prediction, with a score of 0.37. In conclusion, PD is a complex disorder without a known cure. However, biomarker analysis with machine learning offers promise for early PD detection and gives clinicians and patients hope for early diagnosis and better treatment strategies.","","979-8-3503-0611-8","10.1109/ICCCIS60361.2023.10425287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10425287","Parkinson's disease (PD);Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS);Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)","Proteins;Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Peptides;Biomarkers;Predictive models;Random forests","","","","15","IEEE","15 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our idea is to employ LSTM to detect walking abnormalities. To examine the effectiveness, we conducted some experiments. Firstly, two Parkinson's disease patients in on-state were asked to perform two 60-seconds walks. Secondly, a healthy person performed pseudo-off-state abnormal gait by attaching rubber restraints to his feet. Finally, a model was generated by the time series of acceleration in off-state patients' walk. The model was then used to calculate Mahalanobis distance to examine anomalies by comparing the model to the pseudo off-state walk data. As a result, the distance exhibited significantly high values at the pseudo off-state walk phases, which suggests that the proposed simple method will detect off-state walking by actual Parkinson’s disease patients.","","978-1-6654-1904-8","10.1109/LifeTech53646.2022.9754768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754768","Parkinson’s Disease;Off Phenomenon;Accelerometer;Walking;Periodicity","Legged locomotion;Performance evaluation;Parkinson's disease;Time series analysis;Medical services;Logic gates;Data models","","3","","4","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The images used in this study were obtained from the NTUA Parkinson's disease database: 11 SWI image volumes (4 Non-PD and 7 PD) and 8 Magnitude image volumes (3 Non-PD and 5 PD). One Non-PD template was created per each image type to obtain a mask of the left and right SN. All images were registered to the respective template. The segmentation method consisted of setting a seed point based on the masks of 2D image slices created to perform a flood fill algorithm. The method's performance was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between automatic and manual segmentation. The segmentation method achieved higher performance using the SWI images (DSC: SN $=0.684 \pm 0.182$; left SN $=0.722 \pm 0.137$; right SN: $0.664 \pm 0.226$) than using the Magnitude images (DSC: SN $=0.589 \pm 0.249$; left SN $=0.604 \pm 0.223$; right SN $=0.569 \pm$ 0.284), suggesting that the SWI images are more suitable for SN segmentation.

Utilized data to extract the temporal shapes of the gait cycle are based on changing vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF), measured by 16 sensors placed in the soles of shoes worn by each subject. To reduce the number of data dimensions, the sequences of corresponding sensors placed in different feet are combined by subtraction. This method analyzes the temporal pattern of time-series collected from different sensors, without extracting special features representing statistics of different parts of the gait cycle.

Here, we have focused on exploring the contribution of Loading Response and Terminal Stance to risk of fall along with the relevance of postural deformity (e.g., knee bending) while an individual walked overground on pathways (with 0° and 180° turn) under dual task condition. For this, we have used a wearable device consisting of a pair of Sensored shoes and Knee Bending Angle Recorder Units. The device was used to compute Coefficient of Variation of knee bending angle during different gait phases as an indicator of one's risk of fall that corroborated with clinical measure.

Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative, progressive disease that can be in sight in older people but also the younger population. As the disease progresses, conditions such as posture disorders, falls, and dementia may also occur. One of the most challenging and restrictive conditions for Parkinson's patients in daily life is the ""Freeze of Gait"" (F.o.G). This study aims to propose and present a design process for an electronic smart belt to increase the mobility and life quality of patients with Parkinson's disease in the case of a freeze of gait. During the design step, Arduino Pro Micro, laser diode, gyroscope and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors were preferred, immediately detecting the user's F.o.G (Freeze of Gait) condition. The work process of the proposed smart belt begins by transmitting the gyroscope data to Arduino Pro Micro. The mainboard activates the laser diode and provides a visual stimulus by drawing a laser walking line in front of the patient. This system allows the patient's relatives to be instantly informed about the F.o.G situation, even if they are far from the person they care for, with the help of SMS-retrieved location data from a GSM sensor. Sensors and circuits are integrated into the belt prototype, which is designed based on the universal design principle and tested for the usability step. Laboratory assessments show that the proposed model is ready for use and serial production.

It causes some or all loss of the ability to move, speak, behave, think, and perform other essential tasks. Monitoring the patient's condition on a frequent basis is one of the essential elements of a successful treatment. In order to track the evolution of a condition, physiological analysis results are translated to a metric, the Universal Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). It is a scoring system that measures the existence and severity of the symptoms. It ranges from 0-176 for patients who are not receiving treatment, with 0 denoting a healthy condition and 176 denoting entire disability. It is divided into three categories: motor activities, everyday living activities, and thought, behavior, and mood. The motor UPDRS measures the functions including speech, facial expression, stiffness, and tremor on a scale of 0 to 108, with 0 signifying normal status and 108 denoting significant movement disorders. Speech spans from 0 to 8, where 8 indicates incoherent speech. Nowadays, in health care environments, noninvasive tele-monitoring is a growing alternative that may allow for reliable, affordable disease screening and relieving the strain of frequent, clinic visits. As a result, the burden on the costs is reduced, and the clinical evaluation of the subject's condition is evaluated more accurately. The information acquired from the patients can be utilized to accurately anticipate how severe a patient's PD symptoms will be. The proposed study uses a variety of models such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boost and xgboost with parameter optimization for maximizing the prediction accuracy. The random forest model has the highest R2 value and the lowest RMSE.We also investigate the relationship between the two dependent target variables, total UPDRS and motor UPDRS.

This degeneration is expressed through motor symptoms like tremors, bradykinesia (movement reduction), rigidity, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms like cognitive impairment, depression, and sleep disturbances. The impact of PD on those affected is considerable, often leading to a notable decline in quality of life, diminished independence, and heightened healthcare costs. Although therapeutic approaches like dopamine replacement therapy, deep brain stimulation, and rehabilitation can alleviate symptoms, identifying a conclusive treatment for PD remains a challenging endeavor. Accurate and careful analysis is essential for effective treatment planning and for slowing down the disease's progression. Fuzzy logic, which addresses uncertainty and vague information, can predict PD by examining the severity of symptoms and patient information. By combining quantum computing with advanced data analysis, we can significantly improve the way we process and understand complex medical data. This breakthrough enables us to make more accurate predictions about the progression of diseases, such as Parkinson's, and even offers the potential for personalized treatment recommendations. By harnessing the power of quantum computing, can tap into the intricate patterns hidden within neurological signals, ultimately leading to more effective treatments for patients with Parkinson's and other conditions.

These illnesses manifest their symptoms at a far later stage, making a full recovery all but impossible. The second most typical diagnosis for a neurodegenerative condition of the brain is Parkinson's disease (PD). One could claim that it causes a great deal of agony to the patients and is nearly incurable. All of these point out the impending need for a quick, accurate, and comprehensive diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. An intense problem calls for automating the diagnostic to produce accurate and trustworthy outcomes. Speech measurements and indicators are one of the most crucial factors in PD prediction because it has been shown that the majority of PD patients exhibit some form of speech impairment or dysphonia. In order to successfully predict the severity of Parkinson's disease, it is important to compare different machine learning models. The goal of this work is to compare these models in order to create an accurate model that can be used to diagnose Parkinson's disease earlier and, ultimately, help treat and recover PD patients. We intend to use the Parkinson's Telemonitoring data set that we obtained from the UCIML repository for the aforementioned purpose.","","978-1-6654-7655-3","10.1109/ICCST55948.2022.10040421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040421","","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Scientific computing;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Ensemble learning","","4","","10","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method uses cyclogram characteristics such as the slope, second moment of area and the area of the cyclogram to compare movements of left and right side of body. For symmetric movement, cyclogram should lie on a symmetry line passing through the origin inclined at an angle 45°. To study the body movement, measurement was performed using accelerometers (Xsens Technologies B.V.). Four accelerometers were placed on subject's arms and legs to measure accelerations in the anterior-posterior, medial-lateral and inferior-superior directions. Subjects (patients and healthy subjects) accomplished an extended Timed Up & Go Test (TUG). The data from the accelerometers were preprocessed, and then the bilateral cyclograms of two synchronized accelerations were created and evaluated. Using the cyclograms we confirmed the hypothesis that patients with PD have asymmetrical movements of the limbs. Omitting medication 24 hours before the measurement in patients with early stage PD had little effect on the synkinesias of gait. Findings suggest the possibility of the designed application of wearable MoCap system and bilateral cyclograms for use in drug therapy by evaluating postural stability via measuring accelerations. Thus, method using accelerometers and bilateral cyclograms is newly proposed for patients with PD.","","978-8-0261-0642-5","10.23919/AE.2017.8053628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8053628","accelerometer;bilateral cyclogram;gait;symmetry;Parkinson's disease","Accelerometers;Acceleration;Parkinson's disease;Legged locomotion;Biomedical measurement;Statistical analysis;Motion measurement","","1","","17","","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve the problem of small samples, it was proposed to increase artificially the sample of subjects using the bootstrap method. Three artificially enlarged samples of subjects were created: a sample of patients with PD, a sample of patients with ET, and a sample of control subjects. When constructing models, two problems arise: the problem of inadequacy and the problem of insufficient generalizing ability of the model. Both of these issues must be considered when building models. The paper proposes models that, according to the authors, are promising for the early and differential diagnosis of PD and ET.

Most people diagnosed with Parkinson's disease are age 60 years or older, however, an estimated 5 to 10 percent of people with. It is possible to determine a person's hand tremors. The ADXL335 accelerometer communicates over the I2C protocol, which can be implemented using the ATtiny85's hardware I2C module or by bit-banging the I2C protocol using GPIO pins. Once the accelerometer is set up and configured, it can provide acceleration data in real-time that can be used to trigger the vibration motor.

It connects to an Arduino and ATtiny 85 directly through analog pins. The wide range of wearable gadgets increases the variety of their applications. With the introduction of wearable technologies capable of processing and storing vast volumes of a person's health data, continuous monitoring of the human body is becoming more widespread. The antitremor wearable band makes the person aware of the tremor by the vibration and gets stability when the tremor occurs.

The aim of this study is to examine whether LIPUS stimulation of the motor cortex can improve parkinsonian motor deficit in a mouse model induced by 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Methods: Acute Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model is built by injection of MPTP (20 mg/kg) every 4 h in a total of four doses in one day. Mice are randomized into control, MPTP, sham-LIPUS+MPTP, and LIPUS+MPTP group. For LIPUS+MPTP group, 7 days of LIPUS (800 kHz, 10% duty cycle, 100-Hz pulse repetition frequency, 40 min/day) is delivered to the motor cortex. An open field test (OFT) is conducted on day 4 and a pole test on day 5, respectively. Striatal total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) are measured on day 8. The safety of LIPUS is verified using Hematoxylin and esosin (HE) staining and Nissl staining. Results: LIPUS treatment improves rearing number in the OFT on day 4 $(n= 8, p= 0.037)$ and locomotor activity in the pole test on day 5 $(n= 8, p= 0.007)$ compared with the sham-LIPUS+MPTP group.

Examples of wave trains in EEG are alpha, beta, and sleep spindles. We analyze any kinds of wave train electrical activity of the brain in a wide frequency range. We have developed a new method for analyzing wave train electrical activity of the cerebral cortex based on wavelet analysis and ROC analysis that enables to study the detailed time-frequency features of EEG in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The idea of the method is to find local maxima in a wavelet spectrogram and to calculate various characteristics describing these maxima (called wave trains): the leading frequency, the duration (the full-width on the half-maximum of the peak in the spectrogram, FWHM), the bandwidth (FWHM), the number of wave trains per second. Then we conduct statistical analysis of these characteristics. In our previous papers, frequency ranges were found where the quantity of wave trains per second differs between a group of patients in early stage of PD and a group of healthy volunteers.

It is particularly important to study an objective and fast tremor assessment method to assist doctors in the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this paper, a recognition system of Parkinson's patients' hand function tremor based on machine learning is designed. Firstly, the acceleration sensor is used to collect the hand tremor signal, and then the median and band-pass filters are used to remove the noise. Next, the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the tremors signal are extracted. Finally, BP neural network algorithm is used to classify the tremor degree into three categories. 12 volunteers were selected to carry out the system function experiment, and the results show that the system can achieve the classification of hand tremors, with an accuracy rate of 84.5%. The Parkinson's patient's hand tremor evaluation system designed in this paper has the advantages of low cost, small size, comfortable wearing, and high accuracy.

Tremor is the most identifiable symptom of this disease and it affects nearly 80% of the patients with Parkinson's Disease. This prototype was designed to observe and quantify the tremor signal from Parkinson's disease patients. The prototype is based on Arduino Uno programming and interfacing, and the ADXL335 tri-axial accelerometer is used as a sensor. The resting tremor signal was acquired in the form of acceleration using the sensor accelerometer from fingertip, wrist and forearm of the patient. The Arduino processed the data which was transferred to MATLAB for further processing. The resting tremor was observed in terms of amplitude and spectral density. For the three parts considered, the amplitude values of acceleration were ranging from 40 dB/Hz- 80 dB/Hz and spectral density were observed and compared. Hence this basic prototype could be useful and developed further to assist the Parkinson's Disease patients.","","978-1-6654-4126-1","10.1109/ICBSII51839.2021.9445140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445140","Accelerometer;ADXL335;Arduino Uno;Parkinson’s disease;Tremor","Accelerometers;Wrist;Parkinson's disease;Wearable computers;Instruments;Prototypes;Programming","","3","","21","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Timely and precise diagnosis of PD is of paramount importance, enabling early interventions and enhancing overall patient care. The presented work focuses on non-invasive detection of PD through voice analysis, targeting early intervention. Dysphonic voice patterns, indicative of PD progression, are analyzed using advanced signal processing and machine learning. Methodology involves collecting voice recordings from PD-affected individuals and healthy controls, with rigorous analysis of acoustic features. This approach minimizes patient discomfort and reduces healthcare costs, potentially revolutionizing PD care and enhancing patient quality of life. This study explored the efficacy of 4 machine learning models - Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes- in Parkinson's Disease (PD) detection. k-Nearest Neighbors classifier demonstrates much better performance compared to the other three, achieving an accuracy of 96.61%.","","979-8-3503-7105-5","10.1109/ICDT61202.2024.10489334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10489334","Machine Learning;Parkinson”s Disease;KNN;Dysphonic Voice Pattern","Support vector machines;Analytical models;Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Signal processing algorithms;Machine learning;Predictive models","","1","","20","IEEE","11 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wearable technologies can be useful in this context as long as they do not unnecessarily increase patient and caregiver burden. The goal of the current study was to identify whether using more wearable sensors improved the estimation of whole-body bradykinesia scores. Ten patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD were recruited to take part in this study. Data was collected over 3 separate occasions using clinical evaluations and three-axis acceleration. In order to estimate the clinical scores associated with bradykinesia of the upper-and lower-limbs, a machine learning algorithm using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation paradigm was implemented. Using two sensors per limb did not improve estimation error within the upper-or lower-limbs. Results demonstrate that the use of multiple sensors on a single limb does not significantly improve the estimation of clinical scores related to bradykinesia. However, in order to obtain whole-body limb-specific bradykinesia scores, a minimum of one wearable sensor per limb is required.","","978-1-5090-4722-2","10.1109/CHASE.2017.94","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010649","Parkinson's disease;wearable sensor;accelerometer;bradykinesia;sensor reduction","Wearable sensors;Parkinson's disease;Acceleration;Biomedical monitoring;Monitoring;Estimation","","15","","7","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such motor impairment affects patients' movement accuracy and coordination, disrupting their daily life. Taking into account recent studies stating that computer-based physical therapy games can be used as a PD rehabilitation option, we propose a novel Exergame, the iPrognosis Warming up Game (http://www.i-prognosis.eu/), as a user-friendly tool that could both serve as a computer-based physical therapy game, as well as a means of accurately and automatically identifying the severity of PD motor symptoms. To this regard, we propose a novel deep learning methodology for motor impairment stage prediction that relies solely on human body motion data extracted from the recorded game sessions. Experimental results using a dataset of both early and advanced PD patients reveal a good classification performance of the proposed methodology, predicting the motor impairment stage of PD patients and paving the way for additional research in the field.","2381-8549","978-1-7281-6395-6","10.1109/ICIP40778.2020.9191017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9191017","i-PROGNOSIS;iPrognosis Personalized Game Suite;Parkinson’s Disease;Motor Status;Deep learning","Cameras;Parkinson's disease;Games;Physics;Indexes;Predictive models","","3","","25","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
