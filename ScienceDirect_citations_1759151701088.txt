Abstract: Background and Objective
The importance of early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is by no means negligible because no cure has been recognized for it rather than some therapies only lowering the pace of progression. The research gap reveals information on the lack of an automatic non-invasive approach toward the diagnosis of AD, in particular with the help of Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence. Another perspective highlights that current VR studies fail to incorporate a comprehensive range of cognitive tests and consider design notes for elderlies, leading to unreliable results.
Methods
This paper tried to design a VR environment suitable for older adults in which three cognitive assessments namely: ADAS-Cog, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), are implemented. Moreover, a 3DCNN-ML model was trained based on the corresponding cognitive tests and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with different modalities using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI2) dataset and incorporated into the application to predict if the patient suffers from AD.
Results
The model has undergone three experiments with different modalities (Cognitive Scores (CS), MRI images, and CS-MRI). As for the CS-MRI experiment, the trained model achieved 97%, 95%, 95%, 96%, and 94% in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and accuracy respectively. The considered design notes were also assessed using a new proposed questionnaire based on existing ones in terms of user experience, user interface, mechanics, in-env assistance, and VR induced symptoms and effects. The designed VR system provided an acceptable level of user experience, with participants reporting an enjoyable and immersive experience. While there were areas for improvement, including graphics and sound quality, as well as comfort issues with prolonged HMD use, the user interface and mechanics of the system were generally well-received.
Conclusions
The reported results state that our method's comprehensive analysis of 3D brain volumes and incorporation of cognitive scores enabled earlier detection of AD progression, potentially allowing for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. The proposed integrated system provided us with promising insights for improvements in the diagnosis of AD using technologies.

Abstract: Background
Shift work, the proven circadian rhythm-disrupting behavior, has been linked to the increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the putative causal effect and potential mechanisms of shift work for AD were still unclear.
Methods
Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to discover the putative causal effect of shift work for AD. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and transcriptome data were integrated to identify genes causally associated with AD from circadian-related genes. An in vitro experiment was also conducted to validate the expression of target genes. Based on the identified genes, a novel integrative program and 4,077 samples from 16 microarray datasets were leveraged to assess the extent of circadian rhythm disruption (CRD), defined as the clock deviation level (CDL).
Findings/Results
Shift work causally increased the risk of AD [odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.79 - 3.19, p = 0.01]. Seven circadian-related genes were causally associated with AD, including CCS, CDS2, MYRIP, NRP1, PLEKHA5, POLR1D, and PPP4C. These genes were significantly correlated with the circadian rhythm pathway. CDL was higher in CRD mice group, shift work group, sleep restriction group, and AD patients compared to control mice group (p = 0.043), non-shift group (p = 0.004), sleep extension group (p = 0.025), and health controls (multiple cohorts, p < 0.05). Additionally, CDL was also significantly correlated with AD's clinical biomarkers.
Interpretations/Conclusion
By combining GWAS and transcriptome data, this study demonstrated the causal role of CRD behavior in AD, identified the potential target genes in shift work-induced AD, and generated CDL to characterize CRD status, which provided evidence and prospects for disease prevention and future therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Aging-induced hepatic dysfunction can impair cholesterol metabolism, reducing the availability of cholic acid (CA, bile-acid) in brain. CA is reported to have neuroprotective characteristics in preclinical investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our aim is to probe the causal-connectivity between the players: amyloid, cholic acid and cerebral-blood-flow, and thereby explore therapeutic applicability in AD. From AD neuroimaging initiative biospecimen platform, we evaluated serum cholic-acid (182 healthy/136 AD individuals). We also assessed 50 healthy/50 Alzheimer's subjects containing MRI-ASL scanning (cerebral blood-flow, CBF) and PET-AV45 scanning (amyloid-load). We performed computational causal connectivity to determine the cause-effect relationship among the parameters. Serum cholic acid in AD subjects substantially decreased to half of controls. Causal-connectivity revealed two novel causative pathways: (i) Decreasing serum CA markedly increased amyloid-load; (ii) Increasing amyloid-load distinctly decreased CBF. We substantiated these two causation pathways respectively with collateral available preclinical observations: (a) increased cholic acid reduces amyloid formation by diminishing gamma-secretase; (b) this decreased amyloid induces capillary-flow enhancement by relaxing vascular pericytes. Indeed, cholic acid can increase amyloid-clearance factor. Neuroimaging-based causal connectivity analysis showed that repositioned pharmacological modulation by cholate derivatives may have appreciable potential as novel window for therapeutic approach to AD. Indicative clinical validation is furnished from available therapeutic trial leads.

Abstract: Background
β-Amyloid (Aβ) fibrillation is critical for Aβ deposition and cytotoxicity during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Consequently, anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody drugs targeting Aβ oligomers and aggregation are considered potential therapeutic strategies for AD treatment. Similar to the working mechanisms of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody drugs, our study identified osmundacetone (OAC), a small-molecule compound isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine Rhizoma Osmundae, as exerting anti-AD effects by targeting Aβ.
Purpose
This study sought to determine whether OAC influences the Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice and to identify potential regulatory mechanisms.
Methods
Five-month-old APP/PS1 mice were injected intraperitoneally with OAC at a dose of 1 mg/kg for 12 weeks. The cognitive functions of the mice were assessed via the Morris water maze test and the open field test. Osmundacetone was analyzed via molecular docking, an isothermal dose‒response fingerprint-cellular context thermal shift assay, a thioflavine T fluorescence assay, and an atomic force microscopy assay to analyze the effects of OAC on Aβ fibrillation. Immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to assess Aβ clearance, AD pathology, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses.
Results
The innovative biochemical and physical data illustrated that the ability of OAC to inhibit Aβ fibrillation was accomplished by binding directly to Aβ, which differed from the majority of previously reported natural polyphenols that modulate the Aβ content and structure in an indirect manner. The inhibition of Aβ fibrosis by OAC subsequently promoted Aβ lysosomal degradation, resulting in a decreased Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, OAC treatment inhibited oxidative damage by upregulating glutathione peroxidase expression and attenuated the production of inflammatory factors by downregulating nuclear factor-kB phosphorylation in APP/PS1 mice.
Conclusion
These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that OAC could reduce the brain Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice by inhibiting Aβ fibrillation through direct binding to Aβ and improve cognitive dysfunction by attenuating oxidative damage and neuroinflammation. These findings indicate that OAC may be a promising candidate for the treatment of AD.

Abstract: Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests a significant relationship between gut microbiota and brain health, mediated through the gut-brain axis. Alterations in gut microbiota composition may influence AD progression by affecting molecular pathways and miRNA interactions.
Methods
We retrieved and analyzed microarray data from 34 tissue samples of AD patients and controls (GEO accession number GSE110298). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the GCS score package in R, considering a p-value < 0.05 and logFC<-1 and logFC>1 to isolate significant gene clusters. Enrichment analysis of signaling pathways and gene ontology was conducted using Enrichr, KEGG, Panther, DAVID, and shiny GO databases. Protein-protein interactions were visualized with Networkanalyst and CytoScape. Gut microbiota in 200 CE patients was analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from gutMDisorder and GMrepo databases. miRNA interactions were evaluated using miEAA, Targetscan, MienTurnet, and miRnet databases.
Results
Significant reductions in microbial taxa, including Clostridia (LDA score −4.878208), Firmicutes (LDA score −4.817032), and Faecalibacterium (LDA score −4.40714), were observed in AD patients. Pathway analysis highlighted the involvement of Axon guidance, ErbB, and MAPK signaling pathways in AD. Venn diagram analysis identified 619 intersecting genes in brain and gut tissues, emphasizing pathways such as Axon Guidance and Cell Cycle. miRNA analysis revealed important regulatory miRNAs, including hsa-let-7c, hsa-mir-125b-2, and hsa-mir-145, which target key transcription factors involved in AD pathology.
Conclusion
The study demonstrates significant dysbiosis in the gut microbiota of AD patients and underscores the potential role of gut microbiota in AD progression through altered signaling pathways and miRNA interactions. These findings highlight the need for further research into microbiota-based interventions as potential therapeutic strategies for AD.

Abstract: Nanoconjugates are promising for therapeutic drug delivery and targeted applications due to the numerous opportunities to functionalize their surface. The present study reports the synthesis of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-entrapped polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanoconjugates, precisely 5-FU-PVP and 5-FU-PVP-Au, and the evaluation of protein aggregation inhibition efficiency. The 5-FU-loaded polymer nanoconjugates were functionalized with gold nanoparticles and analyzed using characterization techniques like dynamic light scattering, UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and zeta potential analysis. These conjugates exhibit consistent morphology with a spherical, flat, disc-like structure. The 5-FU-PVP and 5-FU-PVP-Au nanoconjugates exhibited a high drug loading, up to 81% and 90%, respectively. The nanoconjugates exhibited prolonged drug delivery of 5-FU from 5-FU-PVP and 5-FU-PVP-Au, wherein 5-FU-PVP-Au depicted a higher drug release. They were investigated for inhibiting the protein hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) aggregation by ThT fibril size measurement, binding assay, and electron microscopy, and the results showed that conjugates repressed the fibrillogenesis in HEWL. The prominent activity of amyloid aggregation inhibition for HEWL using 5-FU-PVP and 5-FU-PVP-Au was found to be 29 μg.mL–1 and 27 μg.mL–1, respectively. The dissociation of amyloid aggregates was achieved against 5-FU-PVP and 5-FU-PVP-Au at 27 μg.mL–1 and 25 μg.mL–1, respectively. Furthermore, the nanoconjugates were investigated for anti-Alzheimer’s activity in the Drosophila model. A Drosophila model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was developed that expressed Aβ42 peptides in the neuronal secretory system to comprehend the pathogenic effects of Aβ42 in vivo. All the results demonstrate that polymer nanoconjugates exhibit more effective inhibition of protein aggregation than bare drugs.

Abstract: Summary
Statistical interaction analyses with biomarkers of pathology on cognitive outcome have been put forward to investigate neurobiological surrogates of cognitive reserve in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, as these potential surrogates are likely affected by neurodegeneration during the course of AD, their joint alteration with biomarkers of pathology and cognitive outcome during disease progression may introduce misinterpretable interaction effects in cross-sectional studies. To demonstrate this, we conducted interaction analyses on synthetic data from a mathematical model of the AD biomarker cascade. When randomly sampling cross-sectionally, these gave interaction effects, which greatly reduced when controlling for the corresponding time point of each sampled data point. Cross-sectional studies investigating cognitive reserve using interaction analyses are advised to take into account the different time stages of the disease that individual data points represent.

Abstract: Non-invasive determination of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and tau deposition are important for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD tauopathies. In the present study, we investigated the capacity of a novel radioiodinated compound AD-DRK (123/125I-AD-DRK) with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 11 nM and 2 nM for Aβ and tau aggregates, respectively, as a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligand in living brains. In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography with 125I-AD-DRK was performed in postmortem human and two transgenic (Tg) mice lines with either fibrillar Aβ or tau accumulation, APP23 and rTg4510 mice. SPECT imaging of 123I-AD-DRK was performed in APP23 mice to investigate the ability of AD-DRK to visualize fibrillar protein deposition in the living brain. In-vitro autoradiogram of 125I-AD-DRK showed high specific radioactivity accumulation in the temporal cortex and hippocampus of AD patients and the motor cortex of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patients enriched by Aβ and/or tau aggregates. Ex-vivo autoradiographic images also demonstrated a significant increase in 125I-AD-DRK binding in the forebrain of both APP23 and rTg450 mice compared to their corresponding non-Tg littermates. SPECT imaging successfully captured Aβ deposition in the living brain of aged APP23 mice. The present study developed a novel high-contrast SPECT agent for assisting the diagnosis of AD and non-AD tauopathies, likely benefiting from its affinity for both fibrillar Aβ and tau.

Abstract: Accurate and early disease detection is crucial for improving patient care, but traditional diagnostic methods often fail to identify diseases in their early stages, leading to delayed treatment outcomes. Early diagnosis using blood derivatives as a source for biomarkers is particularly important for managing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study introduces a novel approach for the precise and ultrasensitive detection of multiple core AD biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, p-tau, and t-tau) using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) combined with machine-learning algorithms. Our method employs an antibody-immobilized aluminum SERS substrate, which offers high precision, sensitivity, and accuracy. The platform achieves an impressive detection limit in the attomolar (aM) range and spans a wide dynamic range from aM to micromolar (μM) concentrations. This ultrasensitive and specific SERS immunoassay platform shows promise for identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a potential precursor to AD, from blood plasma. Machine-learning algorithms applied to the spectral data enhance the differentiation of MCI from AD and healthy controls, yielding excellent sensitivity and specificity. Our integrated SERS-machine-learning approach, with its interpretability, advances AD research and underscores the effectiveness of a cost-efficient, easy-to-prepare Al-SERS substrate for clinical AD detection.

Abstract: Numerous studies linking environmental pollutants to oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurotoxicity have assigned pollutants to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Heavy metals, pesticides, air pollutants, and endocrine disruptor chemicals have been shown to play important roles in AD development, with some traditional functions in amyloid-β formation, tau kinase action, and neuronal degeneration. However, pharmacological management and supplementation have resulted in limited improvement. This raises the interesting possibility that activities usually considered preventive, including diet, exercise, or mental activity, might be more similar to treatment or therapy for AD. This review focuses on the effects of diet on the effects of environmental pollutants on AD. One of the primary issues addressed in this review is a group of specific diets, including the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean-DASH intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), which prevent exposure to these toxins. Such diets have been proven to decrease oxidative stress and inflammation, which are unfavorable for neuronal growth. Furthermore, they contribute to positive changes in the composition of the human gut microbiota and thus encourage interactions in the Gut-Brain Axis, reducing inflammation caused by pollutants. This review emphasizes a multi-professional approach with reference to nutritional activities that would lower the neurotoxic load in populations with a high level of exposure to pollutants. Future studies focusing on diet and environment association plans may help identify preventive measures aimed at enhancing current disease deceleration.

Abstract: In order to gain more insight into the nature of the disease and fill in numerous gaps in predictions and treatment, the problem of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been extensively studied. A lot of research has already been done to assist identify AD patients utilizing structural and textural features. In this work, texture features based machine learning models are proposed for multi-stage classification of Alzheimer’s disease. Multi-stage classification helps in identifying the disease at early stages and will reduce the suffering of the patients and their family members. The patients in this study are divided into four groups: CN (Cognitive Normal), AD (Alzheimer’s Disease), pMCI (Progressive Mild Cognitive Impairment), and sMCI (Static Mild Cognitive Impairment). The dataset is collected from the ADNI database and has about 15000 MRI raw images in ‘NIFTI’ format. In the first step, the data is preprocessed. Images are converted to the ‘jpg’ format after being stripped of their skulls. 8856 images are selected after preprocessing. For Feature Extraction, FOS (First-Order Statistical) and GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) features are utilized. Using normalization, the extracted features are scaled between 0 and 1. The normalized features are then used as input by SVM, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Decision Tree machine learning methods. Input features used for classification include GLCM, FOS features, and a combination of both. The performance is evaluated using accuracy, recall, F1-score, and precision parameters. The suggested method performs best when both GLCM and FOS features are provided as input. The most accurate method is Random Forest, which has a 66.1% accuracy rate. Decision tree, ANN, and SVM also performed well, with accuracies of 56.4, 58.5, and 59.2 respectively. The proposed approach has the potential for multi-stage classification of Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation in the brain are major neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Immunotherapies targeting Aβ and/or tau are deemed the most promising approaches for AD. Administrations with monoclonal antibodies against Aβ have yielded substantial breakthroughs clinically. Most vaccines tested clinically so far failed to prove efficacious in large part due to inappropriate design of vaccine antigens. In this study, a structure-guided approach was employed to design novel antigens targeting Aβ and/or tau by grafting multiple copies of Aβ and/or tau B-cell epitope peptide onto CRM197, which is the most widely used carrier protein in polysaccharide conjugate vaccines. The immunogenicity of the vaccines was evaluated in BALB/c mice and the efficacy was tested in a transgenic mouse model of human amyloidopathy. The antigens were highly immunogenic early vaccination substantially ameliorated cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice and significantly reduced insoluble Aβ42/40 in the brains. These results demonstrate that the engineered antigens have protective effects on AD mice, offering a promising translatable strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of AD.

Abstract: Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by their progressive nature and debilitating impact on individuals' cognitive and motor functions, pose a significant challenge to public health. Despite extensive research efforts, the severity of cognitive dysfunction remains formidable, with gaps persisting in understanding its underlying mechanisms and developing effective therapeutic interventions. Natural phytohormones have emerged as promising candidates for managing neurodegenerative diseases, offering potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. The phytohormone trans-zeatin (tZ) is a derivative of the cytokinin zeatin (6-isopentenylaminopurine). tZ derivatives such as N6-isopentyl adenosine (iPR), t-zeatin riboside (tZR), kinetin (K), and kinetin riboside (KR) are the active components available in coconut water and are also isolated from many plant extracts that aid in plant growth.
Methods
We searched the various online databases (Pub-Med, WOS, and Google Scholar) for the last twenty years using keywords such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, phytohormones, trans-zeatin, and cytokinins, paired with traditional Chinese plants. This literature review sought to illuminate the therapeutic role of cytokinins in AD and PD. In addition, this article talked about the biological importance of cytokinins to understand how trans-zeatin and its derivatives, which are cytokinins, protect neurons. We searched and screened 75 articles. Results were summarized, compared, and research gaps identified throughout the data collection and interpretation.
Results
TZ and its derivatives have garnered attention for their notable biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-aging, cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and particularly their anti-Alzheimer and anti-Parkinson effects. tZ may be useful as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease because it stops cholinesterase from working, stops amyloid beta (Aβ) from clumping together, and changes the Nrf2/ARE pathway. In Parkinson's disease (PD), tZ prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by lowering JNK/P38 phosphorylation, moderating Bax-mediated apoptosis, and blocking caspase 3/7 activation.
Discussion and conclusion
Dietary foods could incorporate trans-zeatin, derived from coconut (Cocos nucifera) and other natural sources, to provide a variety of health benefits. Because they can change important cellular pathways like Nrf2, NF-κB, and PI3K/Akt, they may be able to protect neurons from damage and slow down its growth. By evaluating trans-zeatin's efficacy in preclinical and clinical studies, it holds the promise of becoming a valuable therapeutic agent for combating neurodegeneration in AD and PD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Current diagnostic modalities of AD generally focus on detecting the presence of amyloid β and tau protein in the brain (for example, positron emission tomography [PET] and cerebrospinal fluid testing), but these are limited by their high cost, invasiveness, and lack of expertise. Retinal imaging exhibits potential in AD screening and risk stratification, as the retina provides a platform for the optical visualization of the central nervous system in vivo, with vascular and neuronal changes that mirror brain pathology. Given the paradigm shift brought by advances in artificial intelligence and the emergence of disease-modifying therapies, this article aims to summarize and review the current literature to highlight 8 trends in an evolving landscape regarding the role and potential value of retinal imaging in AD screening.

Abstract: Introduction
Metrics of a participant's socioeconomic status (SES) are not routinely collected or standardized in clinical trials. This omission limits the ability to evaluate the generalizability of trial results and restricts clinicians from confidently interpreting the efficacy of new treatments across important sub-populations.
Methods
We adapted an SES measure of social disparity; the Hollingshead Two Factor Index of Social Position, which combines education and occupation into a single metric. We modernized the 1965 occupations to reflect the 2017 careers tabulated by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. We currently use this adapted measure in Alzheimer's Clinical Trials Consortium studies.
Results
We present the revised table of occupations. We found that the collection of SES data using the modified Hollingshead was feasible in a multi-site clinical trial and scores were distributed across all SES strata.
Discussion
The modified Hollingshead provides a standardized method for collecting SES information, enabling data aggregation, monitoring, and reporting.

Abstract: The recently announced revision of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostic ATN classification adds to an already existing disregard for clinical assessment the rejection of image-based in vivo assessment of the brain's condition. The revision suggests that the diagnosis of AD should be based solely on the presence of cerebral amyloid-beta and tau, indicated by the "A" and "T". The "N", which stands for neurodegeneration – detected by imaging – should no longer be given importance, except that A+ ± T + = AD with amyloid PET being the main method for demonstrating A+ . We believe this is an artificial and misleading suggestion. It is artificial because it relies on biomarkers whose significance remains obscure and where the detection of "A" is based on a never-validated PET method using a tracer that marks much more than amyloid-beta. It is misleading because many patients without dementia will be falsely classified as having AD, but nonetheless candidates for passive immunotherapy, which may be more harmful than beneficial, and sometimes fatal.

Abstract: Most classification models for Alzheimer's Diagnosis (AD) do not have specific strategies for individual input samples, leading to the problem of easily overlooking personalized differences between samples. This research introduces a customized dynamically ensemble convolution neural network (PDECNN), which is able to build a specific integration strategy based on the distinctiveness of the sample. In this paper, we propose a personalized dynamic ensemble alzheimer's Diagnosis classification model. This model will dynamically modify the deteriorated brain areas of interest depending on various samples since it can adjust to variations in the degeneration of sample brain areas. In clinical problems, the PDECNN model has additional diagnostic importance since it can identify sample-specific degraded brain areas based on input samples. This model considers the variability of brain region degeneration levels between input samples, evaluates the degree of degeneration of specific brain regions using an attention mechanism, and selects and integrates brain region features based on the degree of degeneration. Furthermore, by redesigning the classification accuracy performance, we respectively improve it by 4 %, 11 %, and 8 %. Moreover, the degraded brain regions identified by the model show high consistency with the clinical manifestations of AD.

Abstract: Efforts to accelerate Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drug development have been spurred on by the creation of open science, public–private R&D consortia. An R&D consortium provides an improved structure for generating and disseminating AD knowledge across a range of organizations while also aligning their interests. Drawing from archival and interview data collected on 46 public–private R&D consortia focused wholly or in part on AD, we uncover two important innovations: the creation of novel consortium types that facilitate coordination beyond the individual consortium, and the practice of organizations joining multiple consortia. Collectively these innovations provide member organizations with different pathways for advancing AD research. These findings have significant implications for how member organizations should approach collaboration in the AD drug development process.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease, characterized by progressive and irreversible deterioration of cognitive functions, represents a significant health concern, particularly among older adults, as it stands as the foremost cause of dementia. Despite its debilitating nature, early detection of Alzheimer’s disease holds considerable advantages for affected individuals. This study investigates machine-learning methodologies for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, utilizing datasets sourced from OASIS and ADNI. The initial classification methods consist of a 5-class ADNI classification and a 3-class OASIS classification. Three unique methodologies encompass binary-class inter-dataset models, which involve training on a single dataset and subsequently testing on another dataset for both ADNI and OASIS datasets. Additionally, a hybrid dataset model is also considered. The proposed methodology entails the concatenation of both datasets, followed by shuffling and subsequently conducting training and testing on the amalgamated dataset. The findings demonstrate impressive levels of accuracy, as Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) achieved a 99.63% accuracy rate for 5-class ADNI classification and a 95.75% accuracy rate by Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for 3-class OASIS classification, both when hyperparameter tweaking was implemented. The K-nearest neighbor algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 87.50% in ADNI-OASIS (2 Class) when utilizing the Select K Best method. The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm demonstrated exceptional performance in the OASIS-ADNI approach, attaining an accuracy of 77.97% using Chi-squared feature selection. The accuracy achieved by the Hybrid method, which utilized LGBM with hyperparameter optimization, was 99.21%. Furthermore, the utilization of Explainable AI approaches, particularly Lime, was implemented in order to augment the interpretability of the model.

Abstract: Summary
The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Knockdown of ε4 may provide a therapeutic strategy for AD, but the effect of APOE loss of function (LoF) on AD pathogenesis is unknown. We searched for APOE LoF variants in a large cohort of controls and patients with AD and identified seven heterozygote carriers of APOE LoF variants. Five carriers were controls (aged 71–90 years), one carrier was affected by progressive supranuclear palsy, and one carrier was affected by AD with an unremarkable age at onset of 75 years. Two APOE ε3/ε4 controls carried a stop-gain affecting ε4: one was cognitively normal at 90 years and had no neuritic plaques at autopsy; the other was cognitively healthy at 79 years, and lumbar puncture at 76 years showed normal levels of amyloid. These results suggest that ε4 drives AD risk through the gain of abnormal function and support ε4 knockdown as a viable therapeutic option.

Abstract: Phosphorylated Tau proteins are promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease. This study presents a novel voltametric sensor using a vanadium MXene polydopamine (VxPDA) redox active composite and a Tau-441-specific polyaniline molecularly imprinted polymer (PANI MIP) for the sensitive detection of Tau-441 in interstitial fluid (ISF) and plasma. The VxPDA/PANI MIP sensor demonstrates a broad detection range of 5 fg/mL to 5 ng/mL (122 aM/L to 122 pM/L) in ISF without the use of redox mediators, with a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 2.3 fg/mL (60 aM/L). Furthermore, a handheld device utilizing this technology successfully detects Tau-441 in artificial serum with high sensitivity (5 fg/mL to 150 fg/mL (122 aM/L to 366 aM/L)) and specificity within a clinically relevant range. The rapid detection time (∼32 min) and low cost (∼£20/device) of this sensor highlight its potential for minimally invasive, early AD diagnosis in clinical settings. This advancement aims to facilitate a transition away from invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based diagnostic techniques for AD.

Abstract: Background
Little is known about association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and plasma biomarkers across the entire Alzheimer's continuum.
Methods
A total of 305 individuals with amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition (determined by 18F-florbetapir PET) participated in this study, including cognitively normal controls (n = 53), subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 75), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 74), and dementia (n = 103). Plasma biomarkers (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, total tau [t-tau], phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau181], and neurofilament light [NfL]), apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) were completed. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were classified into four subsymdromes (hyperactivity, psychosis, affective, and apathy). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms and plasma biomarkers.
Results
About one-third of cognitively unimpaired individuals (normal controls: 34.0 %, SCD: 28.0 %) reported one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms, and more in symptomatic stages such as MCI (40.5 %) and dementia (81.0 %). Plasma NfL significantly increased in dementia group compared to SCD and healthy controls, relating to a higher risk of aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, sleep disturbance, disinhibition, and euphoria. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.079, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.022–1.140, p = 0.006), lower cognitive score (OR = 0.846, 95%CI = 0.791–0.905, p < 0.001) and increased plasma NfL (OR = 1.021, 95%CI = 1.00–1.042, p = 0.041) could predict psychosis. No significant differences were found in plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, t-tau or p-tau181 across all groups, and none correlated with neuropsychiatric symptoms.
Limitations
The cross-sectional design, small sample size and use of NPI-Q.
Conclusions
This study supported neuropsychiatric symptoms as early manifestations of preclinical Alzheimer's disease, and suggested plasma NfL to be a potential biomarker for detecting neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's continuum.

Abstract: Background/Objective
Alzheimer's disease is a prominent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Variations in subjective cognitive decline among Alzheimer's patients, often reported by caregiver, may stem from cultural, socioeconomic, healthcare access, and genetic factors. This study investigates racial disparities in subjective cognitive decline reported by caregivers and their implications.
Methods
In this study, data from 12,627 Alzheimer's caretakers from the CDC's Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Data Portal were analyzed using JMP software. Caregivers reported patients’ cognitive decline for various racial categories: Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Native Alaskan, and White. Fit model tests and distribution analyses were employed to assess disparities in symptom severity. The study focused on four key questions regarding symptom prevalence and healthcare communication to assess the degree of symptoms the patients were experiencing.
Results
Significant disparities in symptom severity reported by Alzheimer's caretakers were observed among the racial groups analyzed. The symptom severity ranked from least to most severe is the following: White, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, Native American/Native Alaskan, and Hispanic patients. There was variance when it came to communication with healthcare providers, as the Asian population had the lowest communication rates. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions considering cultural differences. It is important that tailoring healthcare approaches for different racial backgrounds is happening as a remedy to this gap in communication.
Conclusion
Due to cultural, socioeconomic, genetic factors, and others, there were significant observed disparities. Tailoring interventions to these diverse populations is crucial to address these inequities.

Abstract: Summary
Background
It is estimated that ∼60% of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are undetected or undiagnosed, with higher rates of underdiagnosis in low-to middle-income areas with limited medical resources. To promote health equity, we have developed a web-based tool that utilizes easy-to-collect clinical data to enhance AD detection rate in primary care settings.
Methods
This study was leveraged on the data collected from participants of the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle (AIBL) study and the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). The study included three phases: (1) constructing and evaluating a model on retrospective cohort data (1407 AIBL participants), (2) performing simulated trials to assess model accuracy (30 AIBL participants) and missing data tolerability (30 AIBL participants), and (3) external evaluation using a non-Australian dataset (500 ROSMAP participants). The auto-score machine learning algorithm was employed to develop the Florey Dementia Risk Score (FDRS). All the simulated trials and evaluation were performed using a web-based FDRS tool.
Findings
FDRS achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of approximately 0.82 [95% CI, 0.75–0.88], with a sensitivity of 0.74 [0.60–0.86] and a specificity of 0.73 [0.70–0.79]. The accuracy of the simulated pilot trial for 30 AIBL participants with complete record was 87% (26/30 correct), while it only slightly decreased (80.0–83.3%, depending on imputation methods) for another 30 AIBL participants with one or two missing data. FDRS achieved an AUC of 0.82 [0.77–0.86] of 500 ROSMAP participants.
Interpretation
The FDRS tool offers a potential low-cost solution to AD screening in primary care. The present study warrants future trials of FDRS for optimization and to confirm its generalizability across a more diverse population, especially people in low-income countries.

Abstract: Background
Sex differences in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are gaining increasing attention. Previously research has shown that sodium benzoate treatment can improve cognitive function in AD patients, particularly in the female patients; and 1000 mg/day of benzoate appears more efficacious than lower doses. Catalase is a crucial endogenous antioxidant; and deficiency of catalase is regarded to be related to the pathogenesis of AD. The current study aimed to explore the role of sex and benzoate dose in the change of catalase activity among benzoate-treated AD patients.
Methods
This secondary analysis used data from a double-blind trial, in which 149 CE patients were randomized to receive placebo or one of three benzoate doses (500, 750, or 1000 mg/day) and measured with Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale. Plasma catalase was assayed before and after treatment.
Results
Benzoate treatment, particularly at 1000 mg/day, increased catalase among female patients, but not among male. The increases in the catalase activity among the benzoate-treated women were correlated with their cognitive improvements. In addition, higher baseline catalase activity was associated with more cognitive improvement after benzoate treatment among both female and male patients.
Conclusions
Supporting the oxidative stress theory and sex difference in AD, the finding suggest that sex (female) and benzoate dose co-determine catalase increase in benzoate-treated AD patients and the catalase increment contributes to cognitive improvement of benzoate-treated women.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, has garnered increased attention due to its substantial economic burden and the escalating global aging phenomenon. Amyloid-β deposition is a key pathogenic marker observed in the brains of Alzheimer’s sufferers. Based on real-time, safe, low-cost, and commonly used, near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging technology have become an essential technique for the detection of AD in recent years. In this work, NIRF probes with hemicyanine structure were designed, synthesized and evaluated for imaging Aβ aggregates in the brain. We use the hemicyanine structure as the parent nucleus to enhance the probe’s optical properties. The introduction of PEG chain is to improve the probe’s brain dynamice properties, and the alkyl chain on the N atom is to enhance the fluorescence intensity of the probe after binding to the Aβ aggregates as much as possible. Among these probes, Z2, Z3, Z6, X3, X6 and T1 showed excellent optical properties and high affinity to Aβ aggregates (Kd = 24.31 ∼ 59.60 nM). In vitro brain section staining and in vivo NIRF imaging demonstrated that X6 exhibited superior discrimination between Tg mice and WT mice, and X6 has the best brain clearance rate. As a result, X6 was identified as the optimal probe. Furthermore, the docking theory calculation results aided in describing X6′s binding behavior with Aβ aggregates. As a high-affinity, high-selectivity, safe and effective probe of targeting Aβ aggregates, X6 is a promising NIRF probe for in vivo detection of Aβ aggregates in the AD brain.

Abstract: Peripheral immune cells play an important role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), impacting processes such as amyloid and tau protein aggregation, glial activation, neuronal integrity, and cognitive decline. Here, we examine cutting-edge strategies – encompassing animal and cellular models – used to investigate the roles of peripheral immune cells in AD. Approaches such as antibody-mediated depletion, genetic ablation, and bone marrow chimeras in mouse models have been instrumental in uncovering T, B, and innate immune cell disease-modifying functions. However, challenges such as specificity, off-target effects, and differences between human and mouse immune systems underscore the need for more human-relevant models. Emerging multicellular models replicating critical aspects of human brain tissue and neuroimmune interactions increasingly offer fresh insights into the role of immune cells in AD pathogenesis. Refining these methodologies can deepen our understanding of immune cell contributions to AD and support the development of novel immune-related therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Light-driven heterogeneous processes are promising approaches for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) by regulating its relevant biomolecules. The molecular understanding of the heterogeneous interface environment and its interaction with target biomolecules is important. This review critically appraises the advances in AD early diagnosis and therapy employing heterogeneous light-driven redox processes, encompassing photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensing, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, PEC therapy, and photoacoustic therapy. The design strategies for heterogeneous interfaces based on target biomolecules and applications are also compiled. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives are discussed. The present review may promote the fundamental understanding of AD diagnosis and therapy and facilitate interdisciplinary studies at the junction of nanotechnology and bioscience.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains the foremost cause of dementia and represents a significant unmet healthcare need globally. The complex pathogenesis of AD, characterized by various pathological and physiological events, has historically challenged the development of anti-AD drugs. However, recent breakthroughs in AD drug development, including the approvals of aducanumab, lecanemab, and sodium oligomannate (GV-971), have ended a nearly two-decade hiatus in the introduction of new AD drugs. These developments have addressed long-standing challenges in AD drug development, marking a substantial shift in the therapeutic landscape of AD. Moreover, natural products (NPs) have shown promise in AD drug research, with several currently under clinical investigation. Their distinct properties and mechanisms of action offer new avenues to complement and enhance existing AD treatment approaches. This review article aims to provide an overview of the recent advancements and prospects in AD therapeutics, focusing on both NPs and approved drugs.

Abstract: The detection of patients in the cognitive normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages of neurodegeneration is crucial for early treatment interventions. However, the heterogeneity of MCI data samples poses a challenge for CN vs. MCI vs. AD multiclass classification, as some samples are closer to AD while others are closer to CN in the feature space. Previous attempts to address this challenge produced inaccurate results, leading most frameworks to break the assessment into binary classification tasks such as AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and CN vs. MCI. Other methods proposed sequential binary classifications such as CN vs. others and dividing others into AD vs. MCI. While those approaches may have yielded encouraging results, the sequential binary classification method makes interpretation and comparison with other frameworks challenging and subjective. Those frameworks exhibited varying accuracy scores for different binary tasks, making it unclear how to compare the model performance with other direct multiclass methods. Therefore, we introduce a classification framework comprising unsupervised ensemble manifold regularized sparse low-rank approximation and regularized multikernel support vector machine (SVM). This framework first extracts a joint feature embedding from MRI and PET neuroimaging features, which were then combined with the Apoe4, Adas11, MPACC digits, and Intracranial volume features using a regularized multikernel SVM. Using that framework, we achieved a state-of-the-art (SOTA) result in a CN vs. MCI vs. AD multiclass classification (mean accuracy: 84.87±6.09, F1 score: 84.83±6.12 vs 67.69). The methods generalize well to binary classification tasks, achieving SOTA results in all but the CN vs. MCI category, which was slightly lower than the best score by just 0.2%.

Abstract: Summary
Genetic variants in ABCA7, an Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated gene, elevate AD risk, yet its functional relevance to the etiology is unclear. We generated a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated abca7 knockout zebrafish to explore ABCA7’s role in AD. Single-cell transcriptomics in heterozygous abca7+/− knockout combined with Aβ42 toxicity revealed that ABCA7 is crucial for neuropeptide Y (NPY), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) expressions, which are crucial for synaptic integrity, astroglial proliferation, and microglial prevalence. Impaired NPY induction decreased BDNF and synaptic density, which are rescuable with ectopic NPY. In induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human neurons exposed to Aβ42, ABCA7−/− suppresses NPY. Clinical data showed reduced NPY in AD correlated with elevated Braak stages, genetic variants in NPY associated with AD, and epigenetic changes in NPY, NGFR, and BDNF promoters linked to ABCA7 variants. Therefore, ABCA7-dependent NPY signaling via BDNF-NGFR maintains synaptic integrity, implicating its impairment in increased AD risk through reduced brain resilience.

Abstract: Ranked as the world’s second leading cause of mortality, ischemic stroke (IS) imposes a significant global burden, marked by its substantial incidence and economic impact across nations and regions, chiefly attributed to its elevated disability rates. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is linked to a heightened susceptibility to IS. However, few studies have been reported to explain the potential correlation between IS and AD. We investigated the relationship and relevant mechanisms between IS and AD using single-cell RNA sequencing and multiple bioinformatics approaches. By intersecting differentially expressed genes and WGCNA critical module genes, we obtained 15 IS related AD genes. According to the KEGG pathway analysis, the IS related AD disease genes were significantly enriched in the parkinson disease pathway, oxidative phosphorylation pathway, thermogenesis pathway, alzheimer disease pathway and neurodegeneration pathway. Finally, five genes associated with immunity (TXN, HINT1, TOMM7, COX7C, RPL17) were identified in IS related AD. Significantly, it was found that all hub genes were mainly highly expressed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, monocytes and oligodendrocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. We believe these hub genes may regulate the immune pathway which may contribute to the development of IS related AD. In addition, these genes may be potential targets for the treatment of IS related AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder, is increasingly understood through the regulatory lens of microRNAs (miRNAs). This review comprehensively examines the pivotal roles of miRNAs in AD pathogenesis, shedding light on their influence across various pathways. We delve into the biogenesis and mechanisms of miRNAs, emphasizing their significant roles in brain function and regulation. The review then navigates the complex landscape of AD pathogenesis, identifying key genetic, environmental, and molecular factors, with a focus on hallmark pathological features like amyloid-beta accumulation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation. Central to our discussion is the intricate involvement of miRNAs in these processes, highlighting their altered expression patterns in AD and subsequent functional implications, from amyloid-beta metabolism to tau pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction. The predictive analysis of miRNA targets using computational methods, complemented by experimental validations, forms a crucial part of our discourse, unraveling the contributions of specific miRNAs to AD. Moreover, we explore the therapeutic potential of miRNAs as biomarkers and in miRNA-based interventions, while addressing the challenges in translating these findings into clinical practice. This review aims to enhance understanding of miRNAs in AD, offering a foundation for future research directions and novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid – β extracellular plaques and tau interfibrillar tangles, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. With dementia posing a growing global health concern, there is an urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address its challenges. The economic burden of dementia is projected to rise significantly, emphasizing the necessity for collaborative efforts in research and healthcare. In the United States alone, millions are affected by AD, with prevalence increasing with age and even affecting younger individuals. The complexity of AD involves intricate biological processes, including the aggregation of amyloid beta, oxidative stress, and metal ion dysregulation. Metal ions, particularly those from copper, iron, and zinc, play pivotal roles in AD pathology, influencing Aβ deposition and tau protein accumulation. Current treatments offer symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying disease mechanisms. This paper explores the potential of various chelating compounds to target metal ions involved in AD pathology. N-acylhydrazones, morpholine, chrysin, quinoline, oxindole, cyclam, catechol-based, and quinazolinone-based derivatives show promising chelation activity and therapeutic effects. Metal chelation therapy offers a targeted approach to AD treatment by addressing the core pathology. By selectively binding to metal ions implicated in disease progression, chelators may minimize side effects associated with broad-spectrum treatments. Additionally, chelators may offer neuroprotective effects beyond metal binding, further enhancing their therapeutic potential. Overall, metal chelation therapy presents a promising strategy in combating AD, with the potential to significantly impact disease progression and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is associated both with imbalances in Al3+ production and changes in viscosity in cells. Their simultaneous measurement could therefore provide valuable insights into Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Their simultaneous measurement would therefore be of great value in investigating the pathological mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease. We designed a fluorescent probe YM2T with AIE effect that is capable of selectively responding to Al3+ by fluorescence colormetrics and to viscosity by fluorescence “turn on” modes. Additionally, Al3+ and viscosity were simultaneously detected in PC12 cells using the low cytotoxic probe YM2T via blue and green fluorescence channels. More importantly, the YM2T probe was used to image mice with AD. Hence, the YM2T probe shows potential as a useful molecular instrument for studying the pathological impact of Al3+ and viscosity.

Abstract: Apolipoprotein B (APOB), a receptor-binding protein present in cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). High levels of APOB-containing low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are linked to the pathogenesis of both early-onset familial and late-onset sporadic AD. Rare coding mutations in the APOB gene are associated with familial AD, suggesting a role for APOB-bound lipoproteins in the central nervous system. This research explores APOB gene regulation across the AD spectrum using four cohorts: BRAINEAC (elderly control brains), DBCBB (controls, AD brains), ROSMAP (controls, MCI, AD brains), and ADNI (control, MCI, AD clinical subjects). APOB protein levels, measured via mass spectrometry and ELISA, positively correlated with AD pathology indices and cognition, while APOB mRNA levels showed negative correlations. Brain APOB protein levels are also correlated with cortical Aβ levels. A common coding variant in the APOB gene locus affected its expression but didn't impact AD risk or brain cholesterol concentrations, except for 24-S-hydroxycholesterol. Polymorphisms in the CYP27A1 gene, notably rs4674344, were associated with APOB protein levels. A negative correlation was observed between brain APOB gene expression and AD biomarker levels. CSF APOB correlated with Tau pathology in presymptomatic subjects, while cortical APOB was strongly associated with cortical Aβ deposition in late-stage AD. The study discusses the potential link between blood-brain barrier dysfunction and AD symptoms in relation to APOB neurobiology. Overall, APOB's involvement in lipoprotein metabolism appears to influence AD pathology across different stages of the disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by metabolic imbalances and neuroinflammation, posing a formidable challenge in medicine due to the lack of effective treatments. Despite considerable research efforts, a cure for AD remains elusive, with current therapies primarily focused on symptom management rather than addressing the disease's underlying causes. This study initially discerned, through Mendelian randomization analysis that elevating pantothenate levels significantly contributes to the prophylaxis of Alzheimer's disease. We explore the therapeutic potential of pantothenate encapsulated in liposomes (Pan@TRF@Liposome NPs), targeting the modulation of CRM1-mediated PKM2 nuclear translocation, a critical mechanism in AD pathology. Additionally, we investigate the synergistic effects of exercise, proposing a combined approach to AD treatment. Exercise-induced metabolic alterations share significant similarities with those associated with dementia, suggesting a potential complementary effect. The Pan@TRF@Liposome NPs exhibit notable biocompatibility, showing no liver or kidney toxicity in vivo, while demonstrating stability and effectiveness in modulating CRM1-mediated PKM2 nuclear translocation, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. The combined treatment of exercise and Pan@TRF@Liposome NP administration in an AD animal model leads to improved neurofunctional outcomes and cognitive performance. These findings highlight the nanoparticles' role as effective modulators of CRM1-mediated PKM2 nuclear translocation, with significant implications for mitigating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. Together with exercise, this dual-modality approach could offer new avenues for enhancing cognitive performance and neurofunctional outcomes in AD, marking a promising step forward in developing treatment strategies for this challenging disorder.

Abstract: Introduction/Objective
Apathy is a multidimensional and complex disease that is the primary neuropsychiatric symptom among those diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, apathy in AD is sometimes underestimated.
Methods
A systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The search utilized specific keywords related to apathy and Alzheimer's disease (e.g., “apathy,” “Alzheimer's disease,” “neuropsychiatric symptoms,” “front-striatal circuitry”). The studies were selected based on pre-defined criteria, including publication date (within the last 10 years), peer-reviewed status, and relevance to neurobiological, neurochemical, and behavioral aspects of apathy in AD. The articles were screened through title and abstract reviews, followed by full-text evaluations to ensure they met the inclusion criteria, such as relevance to apathy in Alzheimer's patients, study design rigor, and methodological quality.
Results
Some research on the behavioral and neurobiological characteristics of apathy in AD points to the role of the front-striatal circuitry, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In addition, we reviewed the neurochemical, neuropsychological, and neuropathological characteristics believed to be associated with apathy symptoms.
Conclusion
The findings indicate that understanding the intricate neurobiological underpinnings of apathy in AD is crucial for developing targeted interventions. Our analysis suggests that a multimodal approach, incorporating both pharmacological and personalized non-pharmacological strategies, could enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. This highlights the need for future research to explore these combined treatment modalities and their potential to alleviate apathy in AD patients.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the primary neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, lacking a definitive treatment. The gut microbiota influences the gut-brain axis by aiding in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis development and neuromodulator production. Research links AD and gut microbiota, suggesting gut microbiota regulation could be a therapeutic approach for AD. This study explores Akkermansia muciniphila’s impact on preventing AD. This research investigates the effect of A. muciniphila consumption (1 × 109 CFU) on tau protein-induced AD rats compared to a control group. Rats were divided into four groups: sham, sham + Akk, AD (tau-induced rats), and AD + Akk (tau-induced rats treated with A. muciniphila). A. muciniphila gavage lasted five weeks. Rats underwent qRT-PCR analysis to assess mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ) in the hippocampus. Behavioral tests included Morris Water Maze (MWM), Passive Avoidance Memory Test (Shuttle box), Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and marble burying. After five weeks of A. muciniphila treatment, anxiety-like behavior significantly decreased. The AD group receiving A. muciniphila showed improved spatial and recognition memory compared to the AD group. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ) decreased. A. muciniphila effectively reduces cognitive impairments and anxiety-related behavior, showing promise as an AD therapeutic by influencing the gut-brain axis.

Abstract: Background
Linking data from clinical trials and real-world claims may improve the robustness of trial data and provide information on the health, economic, and societal impacts of a disease.
Objective
To report on the feasibility of linking trial data to Medicare claims data in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the US.
Design and Setting
Alzheimer's Disease Linkage to Real-World Evidence (AD-LINE) was a noninterventional cohort study that included participants recruited from the GRADUATE program whose trial data were linked to their Medicare claims.
Participants
AD-LINE participants were 66 years and older with early symptomatic AD (ie, mild cognitive impairment [MCI] due to AD or mild AD dementia) and were enrolled in the GRADUATE program and a Medicare fee-for-service or Medicare Advantage plan.
Measurements
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services linked participants' clinical trial identifiers to their Medicare beneficiary identifiers using a deterministic, exact matching process. Demographics and clinical characteristics of the AD-LINE cohort at baseline were collected. Outcomes measured in this study included healthcare resource utilization derived from Medicare claims data.
Results
In total, 147 participants across 21 US sites were invited to participate and 111 provided informed consent. Of those, 61 patients had linkable data (ie, Medicare beneficiary identifier), Medicare Parts A/B enrollment, and no health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollment in the year before trial entry. Of the 61 participants whose data were analyzed in this study, 30 had MCI due to AD and 31 had mild AD dementia. Participants in the MCI due to AD group had more healthcare resource utilization on average in the baseline period than those in the mild AD dementia group (29.9 [SD, 20.9] vs 24.5 claims [SD, 12.3]). In an ad hoc analysis, a relatively high concordance (85.3%) was seen between the rates of clinically confirmed AD diagnosis and evidence of AD diagnosis in claims data.
Conclusion
This linkage process may serve as a proof of concept for researchers interested in linking clinical trial and real-world claims data. The lessons learned from AD-LINE and innovation of data linkage approaches may encourage key stakeholders to link data in the future.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The role of tau lactylation at the K677 site in AD progression is not well understood. This study explores how tau K677 lactylation affects ferritinophagy, ferroptosis, and their functions in an AD mouse model. Results show that mutating the K677 site to R reduces tau lactylation and inhibits ferroptosis by regulating iron metabolism factors like NCOA4 and FTH1.Tau-mutant mice showed improved memory and learning skills compared to wild-type mice. The mutation also reduced neuronal damage and was associated with decreased tau lactylation at the K677 site, regardless of phosphorylated tau levels. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that lactylation at this site was linked to the MAPK pathway, which was important for ferritinophagy in AD mice. In summary, our research indicates that the K677 mutation in tau protein may protect against AD by influencing ferritinophagy and ferroptosis through MAPK signaling pathways. Understanding these modifications in tau could lead to new treatments for AD.

Abstract: Background
Despite higher dementia prevalence in racial and ethnic minoritized communities, they are underrepresented in Alzheimer's disease clinical trials. Community-based recruitment strategies are believed to yield positive outcomes in various fields, such as cancer and cardiovascular clinical trials, but their outcomes in Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) require further study. In this systematic rapid review, we synthesized the available evidence on community-engaged recruitment strategies in enhancing participation in AD/ADRD clinical trials and observational study participation.
Methods
We searched and identified studies describing a community-based recruitment approach for racial and ethnic minoritized communities across seven databases (Pubmed, OVID MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and EMBASE).
Results
Out of 1915 screened studies, 49 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies employed multiple community-based recruitment approaches, including educational presentations, collaborations with community-based faith organizations, community advisory boards, and engagement with local clinics or health professionals. 52% of studies targeted more than one racial and ethnic minoritized population, primarily African Americans and then Hispanic/Latino. Gaps in knowledge about AD/ADRD, its increased risk among minoritized populations, distrust, and stigma were noted as barriers to research participation. Approximately 50% of the studies specified whether they evaluated their recruitment approaches, and in studies where approaches were evaluated, there was substantial heterogeneity in methods utilized.
Conclusion
The quality of available evidence on the use of community-based recruitment approaches to include racial and ethnic minoritized populations in AD/ADRD research, particularly in clinical trials, is limited. Systematic assessment of recruitment strategies is urgently needed to increase the evidence base around community-engaged recruitment approaches.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, leading to cognitive decline and neuronal loss. While current treatments mainly provide symptomatic relief, they do not target the underlying molecular causes of the disease. In recent years, RNA interference (RNAi), particularly small interfering RNA (siRNA), has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for AD. siRNA works by selectively silencing genes responsible for disease processes, degrading messenger RNA (mRNA) and preventing protein synthesis. In AD, siRNA is used to target key pathological factors, such as beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), tau protein, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, to reduce Aβ production, preventing tau hyperphosphorylation, and mitigating neuroinflammation. Preclinical studies in animal models have shown promising results, including significant reductions in Aβ levels and improved cognitive function following siRNA delivery. However, several challenges remain in translating siRNA-based therapies to clinical use, including efficient delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), minimizing off-target effects, and ensuring prolonged gene silencing with minimal immune activation. To overcome these barriers, innovative delivery methods are being explored, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), exosomes, and viral vectors, which aim to improve the stability, specificity, and efficiency of siRNA therapies. Despite these challenges, recent advances in siRNA design and delivery technologies hold great promise, offering a potential new approach to modifying the course of AD and providing hope for more effective, disease-modifying treatments.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Blood-based biomarkers offer a promising, less invasive, and more cost-effective alternative for Alzheimer's disease screening compared to cerebrospinal fluid or imaging biomarkers. However, they have been extensively studied only in memory clinic-based cohorts. We aimed to validate them in a more heterogeneous, older patient population from primary care.
Methods
We measured plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, P-tau181, NfL, and GFAP in 1007 individuals without dementia, aged 79–94 years, from the longitudinal, primary care-based German AgeCoDe study. We assessed the association with cognitive decline, disease progression, and the capacity to predict future dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). We also evaluated biomarker dynamics in 305 individuals with a follow-up sample (∼8 years later).
Findings
Higher levels of P-tau181 (HR = 1.32 [95% CI: 1.17–1.51]), NfL (HR = 1.19 [95% CI: 1.03–1.36]), and GFAP (HR = 1.36 [95% CI: 1.22–1.52]), and a lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (HR = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.68–0.95]) were associated with an increased risk of progressing to clinically-diagnosed DAT. Additionally, higher levels of P-tau181 (β = −0.49 [95% CI: −0.71 to 0.26]), NfL (β = −0.29 [95% CI: −0.52 to 0.06]), and GFAP (β = −0.60 [95% CI: −0.83 to 0.38]) were linked to faster cognitive decline. A two-step DAT prediction strategy combining initial MMSE with biomarkers improved the identification of individuals in the prodromal stage for potential treatment eligibility. Biomarker levels changed over time, with increases in P-tau181 (β = 0.19 [95% CI: 0.14–0.25]), NfL (β = 2.88 [95% CI: 2.18–3.59]), and GFAP (β = 8.23 [95% CI: 6.71–9.75]). NfL (β = 2.47 [95% CI: 1.04–3.89]) and GFAP (β = 4.45 [95% CI: 1.38–7.51]) exhibited a faster increase in individuals progressing to DAT.
Interpretation
Evaluating plasma biomarkers, alongside brief cognitive assessments, might enhance the precision of risk assessment for DAT progression in primary care.

Abstract: Accurate disease monitoring is an extremely time-consuming task for medical experts and technocrats involved, requiring technical support for diagnostic systems. To overcome this situation, we developed an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) based on Tsukamoto Type 2 Fuzzy Inference System (TT2FIS) that can easily handle diagnostic and predictive aspects in the medical field. In the proposed system, we developed a Tsukamoto type 2 fuzzy inference system that takes the patient’s symptoms as input factors and the medical device as the output factor of the result. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the usefulness of type 2 fuzzy sets in Tuberculosis and Alzheimer’s disease diagnostic system. Numerical calculations are also performed to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. A validation of the proposed derivation of the proposed IoMT model is also discussed in the results and conclusions section.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are often accompanied by dementia, motor dysfunction, or disability. Caring for these patients imposes a significant psychological and financial burden on families. Until now, there are no effective methods for the treatment of NDs. Among them, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the two most common. Recently, studies have revealed that the overexpression of certain genes may be linked to the occurrence of AD and PD. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are a powerful tool for gene silencing because they can specifically bind to and cleave target mRNA. However, the intrinsic properties of naked siRNA and various physiological barriers limit the application of siRNA in the brain. Nanotechnology is a promising option for addressing these issues. Nanoparticles are not only able to protect siRNA from degradation but also have the advantage of crossing various physiological barriers to reach the brain target of siRNA. In this review, we aim to introduce diverse nanotechnology used for delivering siRNA to treat AD and PD. Finally, we will briefly discuss our perspectives on this promising field.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Diabetes mellitus (DM) exhibit comparable pathophysiological pathways. Genetic abnormalities in APP, PS-1, and PS-2 are linked to AD, with diagnostic aid from CSF and blood biomarkers. Insulin dysfunction, termed "type 3 diabetes mellitus" in AD, involves altered insulin signalling and neuronal shrinkage. Insulin influences beta-amyloid metabolism, exacerbating neurotoxicity in AD and amyloid production in DM. Both disorders display impaired glucose transporter expression, hastening cognitive decline. Mitochondrial dysfunction and Toll-like receptor 4-mediated inflammation worsen neurodegeneration in both diseases. ApoE4 raises disease risk, especially when coupled with dyslipidemia common in DM. Targeting shared pathways like insulin-degrading enzyme activation and HSP60 holds promise for therapeutic intervention. Recognizing these interconnected mechanisms underscores the imperative for developing tailored treatments addressing the overlapping pathophysiology of AD and DM, offering potential avenues for more effective management of both conditions.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is difficult to cure and of global concern. Neuroinflammation is closely associated with the onset and progression of AD, making its treatment increasingly important. Compounds from natural products, with fewer side effects than synthetic drugs, are of high research interest. STAT3, a multifunctional transcription factor, is involved in various cellular processes including inflammation, cell growth, and apoptosis. Its activation and inhibition can have different effects under various pathological conditions. In AD, the STAT3 protein plays a crucial role in promoting neuroinflammation and contributing to disease progression. This occurs primarily through the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, which impacts microglia, astrocytes, and hippocampal neurons. This paper reviews the STAT3 signaling pathway in AD and 25 compounds targeting STAT3 up to 2024. Notably, Rutin, Paeoniflorin, and Geniposide up-regulate STAT3 in hippocampal and cortex neurons, showing neuroprotective effects in various AD models. Other 23 compounds downregulate AD by suppressing neuroinflammation through inhibition of STAT3 activation in microglia and astrocytes. These findings highlight the potential of compounds from natural products in improving AD by targeting STAT3, offering insights into the prevention and management of AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease, as per reports, 50 million people worldwide suffer from dementia and an increase of 152 million is expected by 2050. This study reports a novel synthetic approach to designing and synthesizing a series of benzothiazole-based fused 1,3,4-triazole/1,3,4-thiadiazole hybrid derivatives (1–19), which show promising potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. These derivatives were structurally confirmed through spectroscopic analytical techniques, including 13C NMR, 1H NMR and HREI-MS. All the analogs were subjected to biological inhibitory evaluation against AChE and BuChE, in which analog 2 ((IC50 = 3.30 ± 0.20 and 3.70 ± 0.40 µM), 7 (2.70 ± 0.10 and 3.240 ± 0.10 µM), 12 (4.80 ± 0.30 and 5.40 ± 0.20 µM), 15 (2.10 ± 0.20 and 3.10 ± 0.50 µM) and 19 (4.40 ± 0.20 and 5.10 ± 0.10 µM)) exhibited spellbinding potency in contrast to standard Donepezil (IC50 = 4.60 ± 0.10 µM for AChE and 5.20 ± 0.71 µM for BuChE). The surpassing potential of the analogs is elaborated in SAR analysis, based on number, position and nature of the substituents. In this regard, analog 15 having two flouro groups, was found as the top ranking candidate, inhibiting the enzymes through hydrogen bonding. Additionally, molecular docking study was also performed to investigate the binding modes and interactions between the ligands and the target protein. Furthermore, the drug-likeness of the compounds was evaluated through in silico ADME analysis, which assessed their pharmacokinetic properties and potential to become a successful drug candidate.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most widespread and irreversible form of dementia and accounts for more than half of dementia cases. The most significant risk factors for AD are aging-related exacerbations, degradation of anatomical pathways, environmental variables and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finding a decisive therapeutic solution is a major current issue. Nuanced interactions between major neuropathological mechanisms in AD in patients and microbiome have recently gained rising attention. The presence of bacterial amyloid in the gut triggers the immune system, resulting in increased immune feedbacks and endogenous neuronal amyloid within the CNS. Also, early clinical research revealed that changing the microbiome with beneficial bacteria or probiotics could affect brain function in AD. New approaches focus on the possible neuroprotective action of disease-modifying medications in AD. In the present review, we discuss the impact of the gut microbiota on the brain and review emerging research that suggests a disruption in the microbiota-brain axis can affect AD by mediating neuroinflammation. Such novel methods could help the development of novel therapeutics for AD.

Abstract: Microarray technology is a powerful tool that enables simultaneous analysis of the expression level of a large number of genes for different samples. Reliable information on gene expression level is much needed in the health system as it is widely used to predict, diagnose, and treat human diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's). For the analysis of the microarray dataset, biclustering is known to be a highly capable approach, however some characteristics of the dataset including high dimensionality, noise, uncertainty, and complex biological processes need to be handled properly. Concerning these characteristics, the current paper proposes a novel two-stage biclustering framework based on soft clustering and a metaheuristic technique. The integration of the two stages ensures a reliable search process to find similar expression patterns concerning gene expression characteristics. The proposed framework employs fuzzy and possibilistic clustering along with Type2-Fuzzy Sets theory to handle high-level uncertainty, noise, and outliers in microarray datasets. Considering the NP-hard nature of the biclustering method, the proposed framework incorporates the Genetic Algorithm with a unique chromosome representation, fitness function, and modification mechanisms. Real microarray datasets of Alzheimer's Disease have been used to evaluate the proposed framework. The comparative analysis of different versions of our proposed framework and some well-known biclustering methods demonstrates that the proposed framework is superior in terms of some indices including the mean squared residual and variance indices. The final results are further evaluated using the defined fitness function, which indicates the better performance of our possibilistic-based biclustering methods.

Abstract: Background
Age is one of the major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is considered the most common adult-onset dementia. There is little information about age-related changes during brain dementia.
Methods
This study observed age-related variations in the brain throughout adulthood in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the AD and healthy brains. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) is used as a database. The method consists of design and develop a computer approach based on artificial intelligence (AI) to segment white matter (WM) from the MRI. Then, the number of pixels within the segmented white matter (WM) of the brain was calculated. Correlation was used to investigate age relation with WM changes in the normal and AD brain.
Results
The WM change with aging was more correlated in AD group (rAD = −0.505, p-value = 0.0007) than control group (rControl = −0.357, p-value = 0.0001).
Conclusion
Higher correlation of WM pixel counts with age in AD group approved that AD is characterized by the relevant involvement of the WM and age. Our approach gained additional information on the quantitative pathological changes associated with the AD as the most common brain disorder of the elderly.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia characterized by neuronal damage and the buildup of abnormal proteins such as beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau. PLGA (Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)) nanoparticles are extensively employed drug delivery platforms, known for their biocompatibility, biodegradability, sustained drug release, and targeted delivery capabilities. Leveraging the potentials of PLGA nanoparticle formulations in targeted drug delivery can significantly impact AD disease management and progression control. In this study, memantine (MEM) loaded PLGA nanoparticle formulations were developed and optimized using the double emulsion technique, to be used for treatment of AD. A novel LC-MS/MS method was developed by our group and was used to analyze the prepared MEM-loaded formulations. The MEM-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were characterized in terms of morphology, particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and in-vitro release. Optimization parameters for particle size, including MEM concentration, PLGA concentration, surfactant concentration, and sonication time were tested. The in-vitro drug release studies were investigated using two different formulations containing D-ɑ-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as surfactants. A higher encapsulation efficiency (EE) (55 ± 5.6 %) as well as higher drug release (25 %) was found in TPGS-containing formulation, highlighting the crucial role of the nature of surfactant in the MEM-loaded PLGA nanoparticle system. The concentration of the surfactant, polymer and the drug molecule were also found to influence the efficiency of the formulation. The morphological analysis of nanoparticles across all formulations revealed their spherical shape. Cytotoxicity evaluation was conducted using the MTT assay with the SH-SY5Y cell line, indicating maximum cytotoxicity of 74.94 ± 7.7 % following a 48-h incubation period. In vitro characterization studies demonstrated that MEM-loaded PLGA formulations could provide targeted and sustained drug delivery for Alzheimer's disease treatment without inducing cytotoxic effects.

Estimates of Current Capacity for Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease in Sweden and the Need to Expand Specialist Numbers,

Abstract: Background
The emergence of disease-modifying Alzheimer's (AD) treatments provides new hope to patients and families but concerns have been raised about the preparedness of healthcare systems to provide timely access to such treatments because of a combination of a complex diagnostic process and a large prevalent pool.
Objectives
We assess the preparedness of Sweden, a high-income country known for its dementia-friendly policies, to diagnose AD patients eligible for treatment within a six-month window, given current capacity for specialist evaluations and biomarker testing. We calculate the investment requirements for Sweden to achieve this target over a timeframe of 20 years.
Design
Desk research to identify data for population, mortality, disease burden, cost of services and current capacity, expert consultation to inform assumptions about patient journey, and use of a Markov model to predict waiting times. The model simulates the patients' journey through different evaluation stages: initial evaluation by a primary care specialist, neurocognitive testing by an AD specialist, and confirmatory biomarker testing with PET scanning or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. The model assumes specialist appointments and PET scans are capacity constrained, and patients progress from cognitively normal to MCI and from MCI to dementia in the resulting waiting times.
Measurements
Projected waiting times for diagnosis of eligibility for disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment from 2023 to 2042 assuming current capacity, assuming 20% of Swedish residents aged 60 years and above would seek an evaluation for cognitive decline. Investments required to scale capacity up to reach target of providing diagnosis within six months on average.
Results
Initial average waiting times for AD specialist appointments would be around 21 months in 2023 and remain around 55 months through 2042, as demand would continue to outstrip supply throughout the 20-year model horizon. Waiting times for biomarker testing would be stable at less than four weeks, as patients would be held up in the queue for their first specialist consultations, and use of CSF testing is widely accepted in Sweden. An additional 25% of AD specialists would have to be added above the current growth trend to reduce waiting times to less than 6 months at an average annual cost of approximately 805 million SEK. The increased cost of volume of biomarker testing would amount to about 106 million SEK per year.
Conclusions
At current capacity, the Swedish healthcare system is unable to provide timely diagnosis of patients eligible for disease-modifying AD treatment. Although future diagnostic technologies, such as digital cognitive assessments and blood tests for the AD pathology, might decrease demand for capacity-constrained services, substantial investments will be required to meet a target of less than six months of waiting time for a diagnosis.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Amyloid β(Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles are widely considered the primary pathological hallmarks of familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, cerebrovascular inflammation, which is prevalent in 70% of AD patients, is emerging as another core feature of AD pathology. In our current work, we investigated the hypothesis that Aβ42 exposure drives an increase in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression, a cerebrovascular inflammatory marker expressed on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelium in humans and murine models. We have demonstrated that the inflammation signaling pathway is upregulated in AD patient brains, and VCAM-1 expression is increased in AD patients compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, dynamic SPEC/CT imaging in APP,PS1 transgenic mice (a mouse model that overexpresses Aβ42) demonstrated VCAM-1 upregulation at the BBB. Although there is a strong association between Aβ42 exposure and an increase in VCAM-1 expression, the underlying mechanisms remain partially understood. Molecular mechanisms driving VCAM-1 expression at the BBB were investigated in polarized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell monolayers. Moreover, by employing reverse-phase protein array assays and immunocytochemistry we demonstrated that Aβ42 increases VCAM-1 expression via the Src/p38/MEK signaling pathway. Therefore, targeting the Src/p38/MEK pathway may help modulate VCAM-1 expression at the BBB and help mitigate cerebrovascular inflammation in Alzheimer disease.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Although considered a core pathological feature of Alzheimer disease, molecular pathways leading to cerebrovascular inflammation remain only partially understood. Moreover, clinical diagnostic methods for detecting cerebrovascular inflammation are underdeveloped. This study demonstrated the detection of VCAM-1 using radio-iodinated VCAM-1 antibody and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging. Additionally, exposure to Aβ42 increases VCAM-1 expression on the blood-brain barrier endothelium via the Src/p38/MEK pathway. These findings are expected to aid in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for addressing cerebrovascular inflammation in AD.:

Abstract: Aim of the project was to evaluate the technical and clinical validity of plasma Lumipulse p-tau, Aβ42 and Aβ40 species and their correlation with CSF core Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) markers; a method comparison with SIMOA was also performed. One-hundred-thirthy-three participants, namely 55 A+T+N+ AD, 28 Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) and 50 controls were enrolled for the study. Lumipulse technical validity showed high stability for p-tau181, Aβ42, and Aβ40, with higher stability of p-tau to repeated freezing thaw cycles. p-tau181 levels detected by both techniques were higher in AD compared to both NDD/controls and exhibited a similar correlation with CSF p-tau levels, whereas Aβ42 levels were slightly lower in AD with both methods. In the comparison between SIMOA and Lumipulse plasma markers, both techniques exhibited similar diagnostic accuracy for AD for p-tau181 (0.87; 95 %CI 0.81–0.94, vs 0.85; 95 %CI 0.78–0.93), whereas the best performance was reached by p-tau181/ Aβ42 Lumipulse ratio (ROC AUC 0.915, 95 %CI 0.86–0.97). The study thus confirmed the construct validity of both Lumipulse and SIMOA techniques for the identification of CSF AD pattern in clinical settings.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains a formidable challenge due to its complex pathology, notably involving mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) signaling. This study delves into the underexplored realm of miRNAs' impact on mitochondrial dynamics and their interplay with amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation and tau pathology in AD. Addressing identified gaps, our research utilizes advanced molecular techniques and AD models, alongside patient miRNA profiles, to uncover miRNAs pivotal in mitochondrial regulation. We illuminate novel miRNAs influencing mitochondrial dynamics, Aβ, and tau, offering insights into their mechanistic roles in AD progression. Our findings not only enhance understanding of AD's molecular underpinnings but also spotlight miRNAs as promising therapeutic targets. By elucidating miRNAs' roles in mitochondrial dysfunction and their interactions with hallmark AD pathologies, our work proposes innovative strategies for AD therapy, aiming to mitigate disease progression through targeted miRNA modulation. This contribution marks a significant step toward novel AD treatments, emphasizing the potential of miRNAs in addressing this complex disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is often not even thought about by the person affected and those around them. They think of the symptoms as a simple forgetfulness, while the prevalence is around 1 per cent in the 65-year-old population and affects 18 million people worldwide. Women are also more likely to be affected and the hereditary prevalence is not negligible. It is a very difficult and particularly stressful time for patients and their families living with this disease. There are various tests, such as the worldwide mini-mental state, which can be used to partially confirm suspicion and confirm further investigation, but the patient and those around them need to be aware that such a test may be necessary. The use of artificial intelligence has long been a feature of medicine and supports the diagnosis of various diseases, but is typically limited to image analysis. CT and MRI scans help in the detection of Alzheimer's disease, but access to these is limited and expensive. Our idea is to create a mobile application algorithm that is more accessible and cost-effective than imaging equipment. In our paper, we show how artificial intelligence can be used to assess your mental state from time to time using a mobile app, and if there is a change, to indicate that you should undergo a targeted check-up for early detection.

Abstract: Background
Recently, two monoclonal antibodies that lower amyloid plaques have shown promising results for the treatment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These treatments require the identification of cognitively impaired older adults with biomarker evidence of AD pathology using CSF biomarkers or amyloid-PET. Previous studies showed plasma biomarkers (plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and p-tau181) and hippocampal volume from structural MRI correlated with brain amyloid pathology. We hypothesized plasma biomarkers with hippocampal volume would identify patients who are suitable candidates for disease-modifying therapy.
Objectives
To evaluate the performance of plasma AD biomarkers and hippocampal atrophy to detect MCI or AD with amyloid pathology confirmed by amyloid-PET or CSF biomarkers in ADNI.
Design
A cross-sectional and longitudinal study.
Setting and Participants
Data were from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants were aged 55–90 years old with plasma biomarker and structural MRI brain data.
Measurements
The optimum cut-off point for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau181, and NFL and the performance of combined biomarkers and hippocampal atrophy for detecting cognitive impairment with brain amyloid pathology were evaluated. The association between baseline plasma biomarkers and clinical progression, defined by CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and diagnostic conversion over two years, was evaluated using a Weibull time-to-event analysis.
Results
A total of 428 participants were included; 167 had normal cognition, 245 had MCI, and 16 had mild AD. Among MCI and AD, 140 participants had elevated amyloid levels by PET or CSF. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 provided the best accuracy (sensitivity 79%, specificity 66%, AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.68–0.77) to detect drug candidate participants at baseline. Combined plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and hippocampal atrophy increased the specificity for diagnosis (96%), but had lower sensitivity (34%), and AUC (0.65). Hippocampal atrophy combined with the abnormal plasma p-tau181 or hippocampal atrophy alone showed high sensitivity to detect clinical progression (by CDR-SB worsening) of the drug-candidate participants within the next 2 years (sensitivity 93% and 89%, respectively).
Conclusion
Plasma biomarkers and structural MRI can help identify patients who are currently eligible for anti-amyloid treatment and are likely to progress clinically, in cases where amyloid-PET or CSF biomarkers are not available.

Abstract: Many changes can now be seen in the development and use of tests, especially those incorporating fluid biomarkers, to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating disease caused by the progressive but rapid degeneration of cortical tissue. Some biomarkers we already know have a significant association with AD, such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau, as well as the ratio of concentrations of other Aβ isoforms. In addition, several novel biomarkers are emerging that can also be used as diagnostic fluid biomarkers for AD, but many studies are still needed before we can consider them reliable. The U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration recently announced its final ruling to regulate laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) as medical devices, which can significantly impact LDT development. In this narrative review, we discuss the current status of fluid biomarkers used to diagnose early AD, their potential and limitations, and the impact caused by the FDA's decision and strategies to help developers navigate the complex changes in the regulatory landscape of LDTs.

Abstract: In the field of medicinal chemistry, the versatility of the thiosemicarbazone scaffold makes it a promising platform for the development of next-generation pharmaceuticals. In this paper the thiosemicarbazone scaffold was explored to obtain novel series of derivatives: a) thiosemicarbazones 15–31, and 33 containing a linear thiosemicarbazone scaffold, b) 34–38 and 44–64 containing pyrazoline ring, and c) 39–43 containing the dihydropyrimidine cycle. Among these, compounds 21, 23, 26, 33–35, 37, 38, 44, 57, 61, and 62 demonstrated no significant cytotoxic effects on HDFa cells at concentrations up to 500 μg/mL. Importantly, compounds 21, 23, 26, 33, 34, 35, and 37 exhibited significant protective effects against neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid peptide (1-42) in differentiated SHSY-5Y cell cultures. Enzymatic assays targeting BACE1 and AChE revealed modest inhibitory activity in compounds 21, 23, and 34, 37, respectively. The identification of compounds with inhibitory effects and neuroprotective activity against beta-amyloid peptide (1-42) offers a platform for further optimization and refinement of these compounds to enhance their potency and selectivity.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main dementia type accounting for over 70 % of the entire dementia population and exhibits progressive decline in memory and executive function. AD pathology is characterized by amyloid fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, consistently colocalizes with the amyloid deposits is characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and may contribute to the generation of amyloid proteins. AChE is a potent amyloid-promoting factor as compared with other associated proteins. AChE inhibitors play a vital role to prevent the formation of toxic oligomeric form of amyloid peptide. Recent studies have reported that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is) are present in plants, fungi, and marine products. Some cholinesterase inhibitors, obtained from plant source such as rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine, used in the treatment of AD, offer an alternative approach to alleviate its symptoms by reducing Aβ. Due to limited efficacy of currently available drugs for AD, there is huge potential of phytomedicines for the treatment of AD. Medicinal herbs and herbal drug preparations have traditionally been used to treat neurological disorders such as AD by exhibiting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Phytomedicines containing flavonoids, polyphenols, and other naturally occurring antioxidants crosses the blood-brain barrier and protect neurons from oxidative stress. As compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicines have fewer side effects. Therefore, recent research is focused to explore the potential of phytomedicines and develop it as effective treatment for AD. In our review, we summarized the pathology of AD, amyloid-deposition, role of Acetylcholinesterase, potential of phytoconstituents with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity for AD treatment.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, disrupting brain cell communication, causing atrophy, and leading to cognitive decline. It poses a substantial global health challenge, necessitating urgent research. Molecular biomarkers, reflecting AD progression, have been identified in diverse bodily tissues. Notably, emerging epigenetic biomarkers introduce a novel dimension to AD pathophysiology. However, their precise role in early AD detection and prognosis remains unclear. This review classifies various epigenetic biomarkers, emphasizing their potential in early detection and prognosis. Various epigenetic biomarkers like DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, histone modification, OMICS, and many more get significantly altered during AD; these biomarkers being distinctly expressed in normal conditions to AD offer a huge therapeutic benefit to stop the progression or worsening it. We explore the therapeutic implications and propose integration with existing diagnostic methods to intervene in AD progression, mitigating exacerbation. Addressing challenges, we envision the future scope of these biomarkers, emphasizing their synergy with computational approaches for enhanced AD detection. This review contributes to the field by proposing a multifaceted approach that combines epigenetic markers with computational analysis to improve early detection and facilitate timely therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, we discuss the economic implications of these biomarkers, proposing that their early application could significantly reduce the financial burden of AD by delaying the progression and severity of the disease.

Abstract: A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is a crucial transmembrane protein involved in diverse cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proteolysis. ADAM10’s ability to cleave over 100 substrates underscores its significance in physiological and pathological contexts, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This review comprehensively examines ADAM10’s multifaceted roles, highlighting its critical function in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which mitigates amyloid beta (Aβ) production, a critical factor in AD development. We summarize the regulation of ADAM10 at multiple levels: transcriptional, translational, and post-translational, revealing the complexity and responsiveness of its expression to various cellular signals. A standardized nomenclature for ADAM10 isoforms is proposed to improve clarity and consistency in research, facilitating better comparison and replication of findings across studies. We address the challenges in detecting ADAM10 isoforms using antibodies, advocating for standardized detection protocols to resolve discrepancies in results from different biological matrices. By highlighting these issues, this review underscores the potential of ADAM10 as a biomarker for early diagnosis and a therapeutic target in AD. By consolidating current knowledge on ADAM10’s regulation and function, we aim to provide insights that will guide future research and therapeutic strategies in the AD context.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves a complex pathological process that evolves over years, and its etiology is understood as a classic example of gene-environment interaction. The notion that exposure to microbial organisms may play some role in AD pathology has been proposed and debated for decades. New evidence from model organisms and -omic studies, as well as epidemiological data from the recent COVID-19 pandemic and widespread use of vaccines, offers new insights into the “germ hypothesis” of AD. To review new evidence and identify key research questions, the Duke/University of North Carolina (Duke/UNC) Alzheimer's Disease Research Center hosted a virtual symposium and workshop: “New Approaches for Understanding the Potential Role of Microbes in Alzheimer's disease.” Discussion centered around the antimicrobial protection hypothesis of amyloid accumulation, and other mechanisms by which microbes could influence AD pathology including immune cell activation, changes in blood-brain barrier, or direct neurotoxicity. This summary of proceedings reviews the content presented in the symposium and provides a summary of major topics and key questions discussed in the workshop.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of cognitive decline in the aging population, presenting a critical need for early diagnosis and effective prognostic tools. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, have emerged as promising biomarkers for AD due to their roles in regulating gene expression and potential for reversibility. This review examines the current landscape of epigenetic biomarkers in AD, emphasizing their diagnostic and prognostic relevance. DNA methylation patterns in genes such as APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 are highlighted for their strong associations with AD pathology. Alterations in DNA methylation at specific CpG sites have been consistently observed in AD patients, suggesting their utility in early detection. Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, also play a crucial role in chromatin remodelling and gene expression regulation in AD. Dysregulated histone acetylation and methylation have been linked to AD progression, making these modifications valuable biomarkers. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), further contribute to the epigenetic regulation in AD. miRNAs can modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and have been found in altered levels in AD, while lncRNAs can influence chromatin structure and gene expression. The presence of these non-coding RNAs in biofluids like blood and cerebrospinal fluid positions them as accessible and minimally invasive biomarkers. Technological advancements in detecting and quantifying epigenetic modifications have propelled the field forward. Techniques such as next-generation sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays offer high sensitivity and specificity, enabling the detailed analysis of epigenetic changes in clinical samples. These tools are instrumental in translating epigenetic research into clinical practice. This review underscores the potential of epigenetic biomarkers to enhance the early diagnosis and prognosis of AD, paving the way for personalized therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes. The integration of these biomarkers into clinical workflows promises to revolutionize AD management, offering hope for better disease monitoring and intervention.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD); yet, some 20 percent do not develop any signs of dementia until after 65 years or in their lifetime. Mosaicism could contribute to this phenotypic variation, where some disomic cells could lead to lower levels of gene products from chromosome 21.
Methods
We examined longitudinal neuropsychological and biomarker data from two large studies of DS: the Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium–Down syndrome study (ABC-DS) (n = 357); and a legacy study (n = 468). We assessed mosaicism using karyotyping or GWAS data. Participants had data on plasma AD biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, tau, and NfL) and longitudinal cognitive measures. A subset had cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, tau, ptau181, and NfL) and amyloid and tau PET data.
Findings
For both cohorts, the prevalence of mosaicism was <10% (ABC-DS: 7.3%; Legacy: 9.6%), and those with mosaicism had lower plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations. For the older legacy cohort, when compared to those with full trisomy, those with mosaicism had significantly smaller decline in total and annualized neurocognitive scores, and lower incidence and prevalence of dementia.
Interpretation
Mosaicism in DS was associated with lower concentrations of plasma Aβ peptides, possibly leading to lower AD risk. However, its clinical impact was less clear in the younger ABC-DC cohort, and a follow-up study is warranted.

Abstract: Objectives
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects older individuals. Due to its high incidence, an accurate and efficient stratification system could greatly aid in the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of AD patients. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in the automated stratification of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) participants using MRI, owing to their high predictive accuracy and reliability. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm based on CNN and radiomic features derived from ROIs of bilateral hippocampus and amygdala in brain MRI for stratification between AD, MCI and CN.
Methods
In this study, we proposed a CNN and radiomic features-based algorithm using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. T1-weighted images were used. We utilized three datasets, including AD (199 cases, 602 images), MCI (200 cases, 948 images), and CN (200 cases, 853 images), to perform binary classification (AD vs. CN, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. CN). Finally, we obtained the accuracy (ACC) and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
Results
Our proposed algorithm achieved acceptable overall discrimination accuracy. In the term of AD vs CN, radiomic-based algorithm alone obtained ACC of 82.6 % and AUC of 88.8, CNN-based algorithm obtained ACC of 80 % and AUC of 87.2 and their fusion showed ACC of 84.4 % and AUC of 90. In the term of MCI vs CN, radiomic-based algorithm alone obtained ACC of 71.6 % and AUC of 77.8, CNN-based algorithm obtained ACC of 69 % and AUC of 75 and their fusion showed ACC of 72.7 % and AUC of 80. In the term of AD vs MCI, radiomic-based algorithm alone obtained ACC of 57 % and AUC of 57.5, CNN-based algorithm obtained ACC of 56.6 % and AUC of 57.7 and their fusion showed ACC of 58 % and AUC of 59.5.
Conclusion
In conclusion, it has been determined that hippocampus and amygdala-based stratification using CNN features and radiomic features-based algorithm is a promising method for the classification of AD, MCI, and CN participants.
Advances in knowledge
This study proposed an automated procedures based on MRI-derived radiomic features and CNN for classification between AD, MCI and CN.

Abstract: The complex molecular mechanism and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) limits the development of effective therapeutics or prevention strategies. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided drug discovery combined with genetics/multi-omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiology and precision medicine of the disease, including AD and AD-related dementia. In this review, we summarize the AI-driven methodologies for AD-agnostic drug discovery and development, including de novo drug design, virtual screening, and prediction of drug-target interactions, all of which have shown potentials. In particular, AI-based drug repurposing emerges as a compelling strategy to identify new indications for existing drugs for AD. We provide several emerging AD targets from human genetics and multi-omics findings and highlight recent AI-based technologies and their applications in drug discovery using AD as a prototypical example. In closing, we discuss future challenges and directions in AI-based drug discovery for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: In the current research study, we aim to design and synthesize highly potent hybrid analogs of benzimidazole derived thiadiazole based Schiff base derivatives which can combat the cholinesterase enzymes (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) accountable for developing Alzheimer's disease. In this context, we have synthesized 15 analogs of benzimidazole based thiadiazole derivatives, which were subsequently confirmed through spectroscopic techniques including 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HREI-MS. Biological investigation of all the analogs revealed their varied acetylcholinesterase inhibitory potency covering a range between 3.20 ± 0.10 μM to 20.50 ± 0.20 μM as well as butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory potential with a range of 4.30 ± 0.50 μM to 20.70 ± 0.50 μM when compared with the standard drug Donepezil having IC50 = 6.70 ± 0.20 μM for AChE and 7.90 ± 0.10 μM for BuChE. The promising inhibition by the analogs was evaluated in SAR analysis, where analog-1 (IC50 = 3.20 ± 0.10 μM for AChE and 4.30 ± 0.50 μM for BuChE), analog-4 (IC50 = 4.30 ± 0.30 μM for AChE and 5.50 ± 0.20 μM for BuChE) and analog-5 (IC50 = 4.10 ± 0.30 μM for AChE and 4.60 ± 0.40 μM for BuChE) were found as the lead candidates. Moreover, molecular docking and ADME analysis were conducted to explore the better binding interactions and drugs likeness respectively.

Abstract: In the context of Precision Medicine for Alzheimer's Disease, the assessment of the central noradrenergic system might be key for optimizing the management of cognitively impaired patients. The Locus Coeruleus, the main noradrenergic nucleus of the brain, is involved early and dramatically in Alzheimer's Disease, and the loss of its function may have detrimental consequences. Recent advances in diagnostic technology have enabled in vivo evaluation of the integrity and functionality of the Locus Coeruleus, revealing the characteristics of this otherwise hidden nucleus. This new perspective may lead to novel therapeutic approaches that specifically target the noradrenergic system in Alzheimer's Disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and there is by far no effective treatment for it, especially in its late stage. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), known as a class of non-coding RNAs are widely observed in eukaryotic transcriptomes, and are reported to play an important role in neurodegenerative diseases including AD. circRNAs usually act as microRNA (miRNA) inhibitors or «sponges» to regulate the function of miRNAs, leading to subsequent changes in protein activities and functions. Accumulating evidence indicates that circRNAs can serve as potential biomarker in AD early prediction. The functional roles of circRNAs are very versatile including miRNAs binding - thus affecting downstream gene expression, generating abnormally translated protein peptides, and affecting epigenetic modifications which subsequently affect AD related gene expressions. Therefore, identifying AD-related circRNAs can contribute to AD early diagnosis and intervention. In this work, we collected and curated an AD-related circRNA dataset; by exploring the circRNAs' corresponding DNA loci distribution in chromatin 3D conformation (3D genome) and utilize the such 3D genome information, we were able to selected a concise yet predictively effective circRNA panel, based on which, significantly better AD prediction machine learning models were achieved.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) are the primary public health concerns in the United States and around the globe. AD/ADRD are irreversible mental illnesses that primarily impair memory and thought processes and may lead to cognitive decline among older individuals. The prevalence of AD/ADRD is higher in Native Americans, followed by African Americans and Hispanics. Increasing evidence suggests that Hispanics are the fastest-growing ethnic population in the USA and worldwide. Hispanics develop clinical symptoms of AD/ADRD and other comorbidities nearly seven years earlier than non-Hispanic whites. The consequences of AD/ADRD can be challenging for patients, their families, and caregivers. There is a significant increase in the burden of illness, primarily affecting Hispanic/Latino families. This is partly due to their strong sense of duty towards family, and it is exacerbated by the inadequacy of healthcare and community services that are culturally and linguistically suitable and responsive to their needs. With an increasing age population, low socioeconomic status, low education, high genetic predisposition to age-related conditions, unique cultural habits, and social behaviors, Hispanic Americans face a higher risk of AD/ADRD than other racial/ethnic groups. Our article highlights the status of Hispanic older adults with AD/ADRD. We also discussed the intervention to improve the quality of life in Hispanic caregivers.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a prevalent neurological condition, poses a multifaceted challenge affecting millions worldwide. It demands diverse solutions, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical, to ameliorate symptoms and enhance patients' quality of life across various stages. Tailored intervention strategies are essential for addressing AD's progression, emphasizing the significance of early detection and stage classification. This study underscores the pivotal role of medical imaging, specifically MRI, in AD diagnosis and monitoring. MRI interpretation is often time-consuming and relies on clinical intuition, necessitating more efficient and accurate approaches. In response, a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model named ALSA-3 and deep learning (DL) techniques are explored for MRI-based alzheimer's disease classification. Various image processing techniques, such as MSE, RMSE, PSNR, and SSIM, enhance image quality. An ablation study systematically adjusts hyperparameters and layer structures. Results showcase the superiority of the proposed ALSA-3 model over traditional methods, achieving an exceptional 99.50% accuracy, with precision, F1-score, and recall values of 100%, 99%, and 99%. Model robustness is evaluated with different k values, reinforcing its efficacy in alzheimer's disease classification. Moreover, the elucidation of the ALSA-3 model incorporates grad-cam and grad-cam++ explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, to furnish comprehensive explanations elucidating the clarify the reasoning behind model decisions. This study not only advances state-of-the-art in alzheimer's disease classification but also holds the potential to significantly benefit patients, caregivers, and the medical community. The improved accuracy and efficiency of our model promise more accurate and timely diagnosis, thereby enhancing the lives of those affected by alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global health crisis, one of the most complex neurodegenerative diseases that significantly affects populations worldwide without any age specificity. The development of AD is associated with the generation of intracellular amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and aggregation of tau proteins, leading to hyperphosphorylated microtubules, which cluster to form insoluble neurofibrillary tangles. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a promising tool in drug delivery, particularly for AD treatment. LNPs, as ideal nanocarriers, can encapsulate various therapeutic agents, such as peptides, drugs, and small molecules, all potential candidates for AD treatment. LNPs offer stability to encapsulated drugs, shielding them from degradation and premature release. Most importantly, LNPs can breach the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enabling targeted drug delivery to the central nervous system. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of various categories of drug-loaded LNPs that have been studied for AD treatment, including liposomes, niosomes, transferosomes, ethosomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers. We also emphasize the need for developing LNPs to facilitate the delivery of AD therapeutics across the BBB.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by brain atrophy and cell death, leading to cognitive decline and impaired functioning. Previous research has primarily focused on using cross-sectional data for Alzheimer's disease identification, but analyzing longitudinal sequential MR images is crucial for improved diagnostic accuracy and understanding disease progression. However, existing deep learning models face challenges in learning spatial and temporal features from such data. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel hybrid DenseNet-BiLSTM method for Alzheimer's disease prediction using longitudinal MRI analysis. The proposed framework combines Convolutional DenseNet for spatial information extraction and joined BiLSTM layers for capturing temporal characteristics and relationships between longitudinal images at different time points. This approach overcomes issues like overfitting, vanishing gradients, and incomplete patient data. We evaluated the model on 684 longitudinal MRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, including normal controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease patients. The results demonstrate high classification accuracy, with 95.28% for AD/CN, 88.19% for NC/MCI, 83.51% for sMCI/pMCI, and 92.14% for MCI/AD. These findings highlight the substantial improvement in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis achieved through the utilization of longitudinal MRI images. The contributions of this study lie in both the deep learning and medical domains. In the deep learning domain, our hybrid framework effectively learns spatial and temporal features from longitudinal data, addressing the challenges associated with multi-dimensional and sequential time series data. In the medical domain, our study emphasizes the importance of analyzing baseline and longitudinal MR images for accurate diagnosis and understanding disease progression.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Background
Social connections have a significant impact on health across age groups, including older adults. Loneliness and social isolation are known risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Yet, we did not find a review focused on meta-analyses and systematic reviews of studies that had examined associations of social connections with cognitive decline and trials of technology-based and other social interventions to enhance social connections in people with ADRD.
Study design
We conducted a scoping review of 11 meta-analyses and systematic reviews of social connections as possible determinants of cognitive decline in older adults with or at risk of developing ADRD. We also examined eight systematic reviews of technology-based and other social interventions in persons with ADRD.
Study results
The strongest evidence for an association of social connections with lower risk of cognitive decline was related to social engagement and social activities. There was also evidence linking social network size to cognitive function or cognitive decline, but it was not consistently significant. A number of, though not all, studies reported a significant association of marital status with risk of ADRD. Surprisingly, evidence showing that social support reduces the risk of ADRD was weak. To varying degrees, technology-based and other social interventions designed to reduce loneliness in people with ADRD improved social connections and activities as well as quality of life but had no significant impact on cognition. We discuss strengths and limitations of the studies included.
Conclusions
Social engagement and social activities seem to be the most consistent components of social connections for improving cognitive health among individuals with or at risk for ADRD. Socially focused technology-based and other social interventions aid in improving social activities and connections and deserve more research.

Abstract: Here, we provide an in-depth consideration of our current understanding of engrams, spanning from molecular to network levels, and hippocampal neurogenesis, in health and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This review highlights novel findings in these emerging research fields and future research directions for novel therapeutic avenues for memory failure in dementia. Engrams, memory in AD, and hippocampal neurogenesis have each been extensively studied. The integration of these topics, however, has been relatively less deliberated, and is the focus of this review. We primarily focus on the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which is a key area of episodic memory formation. Episodic memory is significantly impaired in AD, and is also the site of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Advancements in technology, especially opto- and chemogenetics, have made sophisticated manipulations of engram cells possible. Furthermore, innovative methods have emerged for monitoring neurons, even specific neuronal populations, in vivo while animals engage in tasks, such as calcium imaging. In vivo calcium imaging contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of engram cells. Critically, studies of the engram in the DG using these technologies have shown the important contribution of hippocampal neurogenesis for memory in both health and AD. Together, the discussion of these topics provides a holistic perspective that motivates questions for future research.

Abstract: There is an emerging body of evidence concerning the neurological effect of air pollutants on cognitive function and increased risk of neurodegeneration. Although previous studies have suggested that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are neurotoxic, the effect of PAHs exposure on neurodegeneration remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between PAH exposure and the risk of developing amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For this matched case-control cross-sectional study, we recruited patients aged ≥50 years diagnosed with aMCI and AD from the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, between 2014 and 2019. For each patient, we randomly selected four cognitively healthy controls through frequency matching based on sex, age group, and education level. Urinary levels of four PAH metabolites, 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), 1-hydroxyphenanthrene (1-OHPhe), 2-hydroxyfluorene (2-OHFlu), and 2-naphthol (2-NAP), were measured. A conditional logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association, adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 212 patients with aMCI with 848 matched controls, and 267 patients with AD with 1068 matched controls were included in the analyses to estimate the risk of PAH exposure. We found that elevated urinary levels of PAH metabolites (specifically, 1-OHP and 2-NAP) were significantly associated with an increased risk of aMCI and AD. An increase of one unit in log-transformed level of urinary 1-OHP was associated with a 1.15- and 1.16-times higher risk of aMCI and AD, respectively. An increase of one unit in log-transformed level of urinary 2-NAP was associated with a 1.11- and 1.13-times higher risk of aMCI and AD, respectively. These findings indicate that PAH exposure may increase the risk of aMCI and AD, especially for the elderly population. Considering the widespread distribution of PAHs in the environment, reducing PAH exposure may be an effective strategy for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Background
The Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) is widely used to assess executive dysfunction in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairments due to Alzheimer's disease (aMCI-AD), but its neurobiological meaning is unclear. To elucidate this, we examined the relationship between the FAB score and three key imaging biomarkers: gray matter volume, amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, and glucose metabolism.
Methods
Twenty Aβ- and tau-positive aMCI-AD patients and age-matched controls underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography with [11C]PiB and [18F]FDG. Voxel-based morphometry and statistical parametric mapping analyses were performed to elucidate the relationships between FAB scores and regional gray matter volume, [11C]PiB uptake for Aβ deposition, and [18F]FDG uptake for glucose metabolism.
Results
FAB scores were significantly lower in aMCI-AD than in controls (p < 0.001). In aMCI-AD, FAB was significantly correlated with right inferior frontal gray matter volume and right medial and left middle frontal glucose metabolism (family-wise error p < 0.05). However, there was no correlation between Aβ deposition and FAB (family-wise error p < 0.05).
Conclusions
The decreased FAB score is linked more with frontal-lobe neurodegeneration than with Aβ pathology in aMCI-AD. The FAB could be an early marker for neurodegeneration related to frontal-lobe executive dysfunction.

Abstract: This review investigates the potential link between egg consumption and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a nutritional lens, focusing on key nutrients found in eggs such as choline, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and tryptophan (TRP). Eggs are recognized for their high-quality protein content and are rich in nutrients essential for brain health. Notably, national health guidelines have shifted away from considering eggs as a risk factor for hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease, largely due to the complex relationship between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol levels. Although eggs are a significant source of dietary cholesterol, recent studies suggest that the cholesterol in eggs does not substantially raise blood cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease. This review also explores how nutrients like choline, DHA, and TRP in eggs contribute to cognitive health and may help reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline, including AD. While the direct connection between egg consumption and AD is not fully established, the neuroprotective roles of these nutrients highlight the importance of further research. Additionally, this review addresses common misconceptions about egg cholesterol, emphasizing the importance of eggs as part of a balanced diet for maintaining brain health and potentially mitigating the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegeneration having non-effective treatments. Vaccines or monoclonal antibodies are two typical immunotherapies for AD. Due to Aβ neurotoxicity, most of the treatments target its generation and deposition. However, therapies that specifically target tau protein are also being investigated. UB311 vaccine generates N-terminal anti-Aβ antibodies, that neutralize Aβ toxicity and promote plaque clearance. It is designed to elicit specific B-cell and wide T-cell responses. ACC001 or PF05236806 vaccine has the same Aβ fragment and QS21 as an adjuvant. CAD106 stimulates response against Aβ1-6. However, Nasopharyngitis and injection site erythema are its side effects. AN1792, the first-generation vaccine was formulated in proinflammatory QS21 adjuvant. However, T-cell epitopes are omitted from the developed epitope AD vaccine with Aβ1-42B-cell epitopes. The first-generation vaccine immune response was immensely successful in clearing Aβ, but it was also sufficient to provoke meningoencephalitis. Immunotherapies have been at the forefront of these initiatives in recent years. The review covers the recent updates on active and passive immunotherapy for AD.

Abstract: Age is the largest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder that causes a progressive and severe dementia. The underlying cause of cognitive deficits seen in AD is thought to be the disconnection of neural circuits that control memory and executive functions. Insight into the mechanisms by which AD diverges from normal aging will require identifying precisely which cellular events are driven by aging and which are impacted by AD-related pathologies. Since microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, are known to have critical roles in the formation and maintenance of neural circuits through synaptic pruning, they are well-positioned to modulate synaptic connectivity in circuits sensitive to aging or AD. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the field and on emerging technologies being employed to elucidate microglia-synaptic interactions in aging and AD. We also discuss the importance of leveraging genetic diversity to study how these interactions are shaped across more realistic contexts. We propose that these approaches will be essential to define specific aging- and disease-relevant trajectories for more personalized therapeutics aimed at reducing the effects of age or AD pathologies on the brain.

Abstract: Background
Identifying risk factors for Alzheimer disease in women is important as women compose two-thirds of individuals with Alzheimer disease. Previous work links vasomotor symptoms, the cardinal menopausal symptom, with poor memory performance and alterations in brain structure, function, and connectivity. These associations are evident when vasomotor symptoms are monitored objectively with ambulatory skin conductance monitors.
Objective
This study aimed to determine whether vasomotor symptoms are associated with Alzheimer disease biomarkers.
Study Design
Between 2017 and 2020, the MsBrain study enrolled 274 community-dwelling women aged 45 to 67 years who had a uterus and at least 1 ovary and were late perimenopausal or postmenopausal status. The key exclusion criteria included neurologic disorder, surgical menopause, and recent use of hormonal or nonhormonal vasomotor symptom treatment. Women underwent 24 hours of ambulatory skin conductance monitoring to assess vasomotor symptoms. Plasma concentrations of Alzheimer disease biomarkers, including amyloid β 42–to–amyloid β 40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (181 and 231), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light, were measured using a single-molecule array (Simoa) technology. Associations between vasomotor symptoms and Alzheimer disease biomarkers were assessed via linear regression models adjusted for age, race and ethnicity, education, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E4 status. Additional models adjusted for estradiol and sleep.
Results
A total of 248 (mean age, 59.06 years; 81% White; 99% postmenopausal status) of enrolled MsBrain participants contributed data. Objectively assessed vasomotor symptoms occurring during sleep were associated with significantly lower amyloid β 42/amyloid β 40, (beta, −.0010 [standard error, .0004]; P=.018; multivariable), suggestive of greater brain amyloid β pathology. The findings remained significant after additional adjustments for estradiol and sleep.
Conclusion
Nighttime vasomotor symptoms may be a marker of women at risk of Alzheimer disease. It is yet unknown if these associations are causal.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms such as memory loss and impaired learning. This study conducted a cross-transcriptomic analysis of AD using existing microarray datasets from the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC), comparing them with age-matched non-AD controls. Both of these brain regions are critical for learning and memory processing and are vulnerable areas that exhibit abnormalities in early AD. The cross-transcriptomic analysis identified 564 significantly differentially expressed genes in HC and 479 in EC. Among these, 151 genes were significantly differentially expressed in both tissues, with functions related to synaptic vesicle clustering, synaptic vesicle exocytosis/endocytosis, mitochondrial ATP synthesis, hydrogen ion transmembrane transport, and structural constituent of cytoskeleton, suggesting a potential association between cognitive decline in AD, synaptic vesicle dynamics, dysregulation of cytoskeleton organization, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further gene ontology analysis specific to the HC revealed the gene ontology enrichment in aerobic respiration, synaptic vesicle cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The enrichment analysis in CA1 of HC revealed differentiation in gene expression related to mitochondrial membrane functions involved in bioenergetics, mitochondrial electron transport, and biological processes associated with microtubule-based process, while analysis in the EC region showed enrichment in synaptic vesicle dynamics which is associated with neurotransmitter release and the regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential and synaptic transmission of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapse. Protein-protein interaction analysis highlighted central hub proteins predominantly expressed in mitochondria, involved in regulation of oxidative stress and ATP synthesis. These hub proteins interact not only within the mitochondria but also with proteins in the vesicular membrane and neuronal cytoskeleton, indicating a central role of mitochondria. This finding underscores the association between clinical symptoms and mitochondrial dysregulation of synaptic vesicle dynamics, cytoskeleton organization, and mitochondrial processes in both the HC and EC of AD. Therefore, targeting these dysregulated pathways could provide promising therapeutic targets aimed at cognitive decline and memory impairment in early AD stages.

Abstract: As per the World Health Organization (WHO) estimation, Alzheimer's disease (AD) will affect 100 million population across the globe by 2050. AD is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that remains a mystery for neurologists owing to its complex pathophysiology. Currently, available therapeutic regimens will only cause symptomatic relief by improving the cognitive and behavioral functions of AD. However, the major pitfalls in managing AD include tight junctions in the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), diminished neuronal bioavailability, enzymatic degradation and reduced stability of the therapeutic moiety. In an effort to surmount the drawbacks mentioned above, researchers shifted their focus toward nanocarriers (NCs). Nevertheless, non-specific targeting of NCs imparts toxicity to the peripheral organs, thereby reducing the bioavailability of therapeutic moiety at the target site. To unravel this unmet clinical need, scientists came up with the idea of a novel intriguing strategy of surface engineering by targeting ligands. Surface-decorated NCs provide targeted drug delivery, controlled drug release, enhanced penetration and bioavailability. In this state-of-the-art review, we have highlighted in detail various molecular signalling pathways involved in AD pathogenesis. The significance of surface functionalization and its application in AD management have been deliberated. We have elaborated on the regulatory bottlenecks and clinical hurdles faced during lab-to-industrial scale translation along with possible solutions.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive cognitive decline and neuropathological changes. Pericytes, which are vessel mural cells on the basement membrane of capillaries, play a crucial role in regulating cerebrovascular functions and maintaining neurovascular unit integrity. Emerging research substantiates the involvement of pericytes in AD. This review provides a comprehensive overview of pericytes, including their structure, origin, and markers and various functions within the central nervous system. Emphatically, the review explores the intricate mechanisms through which pericytes contribute to AD, including their interactions with amyloid beta and apolipoprotein E, as well as various signaling pathways. The review also highlights potential for targeted pericyte therapy for AD, with a focus on stem cell therapy and drug treatments. Future research directions include the classification of pericyte subtypes, studies related to aging, and the role of pericytes in exosome-related mechanisms in AD pathology. In conclusion, this review consolidates current knowledge on the pivotal roles of pericytes in AD and their potential as therapeutic targets, providing valuable insights for future research and clinical interventions aimed at addressing the impact of AD on patients' lives.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by memory loss, speech and motor defects, personality changes, and psychological disorders. The exact cause of AD remains unclear. Current treatments focus on maintaining neurotransmitter levels or targeting β-amyloid (Aβ) protein, but these only alleviate symptoms and do not reverse the disease. Developing new drugs is time-consuming, costly, and has a high failure rate. Utilizing multi-omics for drug repositioning has emerged as a new strategy. Based on transcriptomic perturbation data of over 40,000 drugs in human cells from the LINCS-L1000 database, our study employed the Jaccard index and hypergeometric distribution test for reverse transcriptional feature matching analysis, identifying Givinostat as a potential treatment for AD. Our research found that Givinostat improved cognitive behavior and brain pathology in models and enhanced hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Transcriptome sequencing revealed increased expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex proteins in the brains of APP/PS1 mice after Givinostat treatment. Functionally, Givinostat restored mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced reactive oxygen species, and increased ATP content in Aβ-induced HT22 cells. Additionally, it improved mitochondrial morphology and quantity in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and enhanced brain glucose metabolic activity. These effects are linked to Givinostat promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and improving mitochondrial function. In summary, Givinostat offers a promising new strategy for AD treatment by targeting mitochondrial dysfunction.

Abstract: Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to development of cognition and memory dysfunctions. Currently, there is no known cure for AD, although limited medications are approved for the management of disease condition. Various plant-based leads give new hope for considering phytoconstituents as anti-AD drugs. The Piper nigrum L. fruit extract was reported to have anti-Alzheimer's activity. It creates an interest in the finding of active moieties that may be accountable for anti-AD activity.
Hypothesis/Purpose
Identification of multitarget directed ligands isolated from Piper nigrum fruits through AI based studies.
Study design
The phytochemical analysis of alkaloid fraction was carried out by LCMS, followed by the evaluation of constituents through in silico studies.
Methods
The fruits methanolic extract was prepared by cold maceration technique. The chemical profiling of the alkaloidal fraction was carried out using LCMS/MS analysis. The obtained compound's target hit genes were identified through network pharmacology studies using String, Metascape, and Cytoscape tools. Further, docking studies and MD simulations were carried out using AutoDock4 and Desmond-Maestro software. Then, electrochemical properties of hit compound P4 were determined using Gaussview6 software.
Results
From LCMS/MS analysis data, 29 compounds were considered based on compound intensity and accuracy (>95 %). Then, 41 common gene targets were identified from AD genes and compound-targeted genes. The 41 common genes in the PPI network suggested that AChE and BACE1 were the most abundant proteins. Further, docking studies revealed the hit compound P4 binding interaction and energies when compared to other 28 ligands. The molecular dynamics studies showed that P4-AChE and P4-BACE1 complexes were stable, and there were no RMSD and RMSF fluctuations were observed up to 100 ns. Further, PCA and MM-GBSA analysis data supported that complexes (P4-AChE and P4-BACE1) were stable. The DFT and surface properties indicated that compound P4 was ideal candidate for AD treatment and must be considered for further biological activity studies.
Conclusion
The study identified compound P4 (dehydropipernonaline) from alkaloidal fraction of Piper nigrum fruits, suggesting it may be hit candidate for AD treatment.

Abstract: Argemone mexicana L. is a medicinal plant, but its impact on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is right now undetermined. We intended to investigate the in-vitro anti-AD potential of leaves and flowers of A. mexicana methanol, ethanol, and ethyl extracts and to identify multi-modal anti-AD phytochemicals by computational approaches. Molecular docking of 196 phytochemicals identified three hit phytochemicals (protoberberine, protopine, and codeine) with higher binding affinity and multi-targeting ability toward AChE, BChE, BACE-1, and GSK-3β. Further MM-GBSA assays confirmed the integrity of these phytochemicals as the hit phytochemicals. However, these phytochemicals demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) and drugable properties having no toxicity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the binding strength of the hit phytoconstituents in the active pockets of AChE, BChE, BACE-1, and GSK-3β with multi-targeting inhibitory activities. All the extracts exhibited dose-dependent antioxidant and anti-cholinesterase activities supporting the insilico results in the context of oxidative stress and cholinergic pathways. Our results offer scientific validation of the anti-AD properties of Argemone mexicana L. and identified protoberberine, protopine, and codeine that could be used for the development of multi-modal inhibitors of AChE, BChE, BACE-1, and GSK-3β to combat AD. Additional in vivo validation is recommended to ensure a thorough assessment in the present research.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disease that results from the excessive accumulation of insoluble protein plaques—such as amyloid-beta, tau protein, and beta-amyloid precursor protein—in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are known to have high accuracy for the early diagnosis of AD. In this study, we developed a large-area fluorescent biosensor using a rough nanofilm upheaved by carbon nanotube (CNT) growth, then investigated its performance in the detection of AD biomarkers in both artificial CSF and monkey CSF. The results showed that the proposed fabrication process enabled optimization of the nanofilm surface roughness in a 2.5 mm × 2.5 mm sensing area for better sensitivity in the identification of biomarkers. CNTs grown for 10 min produced the best surface area, roughness, and hardness in the upheaved nanofilm. Plasma treatment on the nanofilm was confirmed to maximize the adsorption of AD biomarkers. Fluorescence detection over a large area was also possible with high sensitivity (up to 0.1 fM) for the detection of AD biomarkers in both artificial CSF and monkey CSF. Altogether, these results show the great potential of CNT growth-upheaved nanofilm for use in rapid large-area sensing platforms for clinical applications.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major cause of disability and one of the top causes of mortality globally. AD remains a major public health challenge due to its prevalence, impact on patients and caregivers, and the current lack of a cure. In recent years, polyphenols have garnered attention for their potential therapeutic effects on AD. The objective of the study was to establish network pharmacology between selected polyphenols of plant origin and AD. Insilico tools such as SwissADME, ProTox3.0, pkCSM, Swiss Target Prediction, DisGeNET, InterActiVenn, DAVID database, STRING database, Cytoscape/CytoHubba were employed to establish the multi-target potential of the polyphenolic compounds. The present study revealed that out of 17 polyphenols, 10 ligands were found to possess a drug-likeness nature along with desirable pharmacokinetic parameters and a lesser toxicity profile. Also, the results highlighted the possible interactions between the polyphenols and the disease targets involved in AD. Further, this study has shed light on the mTOR pathway and its impact on AD through the autophagic mechanism. Overall, this study indicated that polyphenols could be a better therapeutic option for treating AD. Hence, the consumption of polyphenolic cocktails as a part of the diet could produce more effective outcomes against the disease. Additional studies are warranted in the future to explore additional pathways and genes to provide a comprehensive understanding regarding the usage of the shortlisted polyphenols and their derivatives for the prevention and treatment of AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating kind of dementia that is becoming more common worldwide. Toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates are the primary cause of AD onset and development. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have received a lot of interest in AD therapy over the last decade because of their ability to redirect the Aβ fibrillation process and improve associated brain dysfunction. The potential diagnostic application of SPIONs in AD has dramatically increased this interest. Furthermore, surface-modified engineered SPIONs function as drug carriers to improve the efficacy of current therapies. Various preclinical and clinical studies on the role of SPIONs in AD pathology have produced encouraging results. However, due to their physicochemical properties (e.g., size, surface charge, and particle concentration) in the biological milieu, SPIONs may play the role of a preventive or accelerative agent in AD. Even though SPIONs are potential therapeutic and diagnostic options in AD, significant efforts are still needed to overcome the inconsistencies and safety concerns. This review evaluated the current understanding of how various SPIONs interact with AD models and explored the discrepancies in their efficacy and safety.

Abstract: Introduction
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and timely and effective diagnosis is essential for the prevention and treatment of AD. Peripheral blood is readily available, inexpensive, and non-invasive, making it an ideal substrate for screening diagnostic biomarkers.
Methods
The Notch signaling pathway is closely related to AD, so genes related to the Notch signaling pathway may be candidate diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Here, we have performed an integrated analysis of peripheral blood cells transcriptomics from two AD cohorts (GSE63060: Ctrl = 104, MCI = 80, AD = 145; GSE63061: Ctrl = 134, MCI = 109, AD = 139) to reveal the expression levels of 16 Notch signals involving 100 genes.
Results
The results have shown the changes in Notch signaling-related genes to be highly consistent in both AD cohorts. Bioinformatics analysis has found Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) related to Notch signaling to mainly play important roles in Alzheimer's disease, the Notch signaling pathway, and the C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway. Multiple machine learning analyses have revealed IKBKB, HDAC2, and PIK3R1 to exhibit good diagnostic value in both AD cohorts and that they may be ideal biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD.
Conclusion
This study has provided a comprehensive description of the molecular signatures of the Notch signaling pathway in AD peripheral blood and a potential diagnostic model for AD clinical screening.

Abstract: Background
The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) studies were conducted between 2014 and 2023, with enrollment completed in 2017 and final study results reported in 2023. The study screening process involved the collection of initial clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and genetic measures to determine eligibility. Once randomized, enrolled participants were assessed every four weeks over a 4.5-year follow-up period during which longitudinal clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging measures were collected. A large number of longitudinal fluid biospecimens were also collected and banked. Consistent with the NIH data sharing policy and the principles of Open Science, the A4/LEARN investigators aimed to share data as broadly and early as possible while still protecting participant privacy and confidentiality and the scientific integrity of the studies.
Objectives
We describe the approach, methods, and platforms used to share the A4 and LEARN pre-randomization study data for secondary research use. Preliminary results measuring the impact of these efforts are also summarized. We conclude with a discussion of lessons learned and next steps.
Design
The materials shared included de-identified quantitative and image data, analysis software, instruments, and documentation.
Setting
The A4 and LEARN Studies were conducted at 67 clinical trial sites in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia.
Participants
The A4 study screened (n=6763), enrolled, and randomized (n=1169) participants between the ages of 65 and 85 with a blinded follow-up period of 240 weeks followed by an open-label period of variable length. The LEARN study screened and enrolled individuals (n=538) who were ineligible for the A4 study based on nonelevated measures of amyloid accumulation using positron emission tomography imaging (amyloid PET).
Measurements
We provide descriptive measures of the data shared and summarize the frequency, characteristics, and status of all data access requests submitted to date. We evaluate the scientific impact of the data-sharing effort by conducting a literature search to identify related publications.
Results
The A4 and LEARN pre-randomization study data were released in December 2018. As of May 8, 2024, 1506 requests have been submitted by investigators and citizen scientists from more than 50 countries. We identified 49 peer-reviewed publications that acknowledge the A4/LEARN study.
Conclusions
Our initial results provide evidence supporting the feasibility and scientific utility of broad and timely sharing of Alzheimer's disease trial data.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to stall the deterioration of brain function, but conventional diagnostic methods require complicated analytical procedures or inflict acute pain on the patient. Then, label-free Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis of blood-based biomarkers is a convenient alternative to rapidly obtain spectral information from biofluids. However, despite the rapid acquisition of spectral information from biofluids, it is challenging to distinguish spectral features of biomarkers due to interference from biofluidic components. Here, we introduce a deep learning-assisted, SERS-based platform for separate analysis of blood-based amyloid β (1–42) and metabolites, enabling the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. SERS substrates consisting of Au nanowire arrays are fabricated and functionalized in two characteristic ways to compare the validity of different Alzheimer's disease biomarkers measured on our SERS system. The 6E10 antibody is immobilized for the capture of amyloid β (1–42) and analysis of its oligomerization process, while various self-assembled monolayers are attached for different dipole interactions with blood-based metabolites. Ultimately, SERS spectra of blood plasma of Alzheimer's disease patients and human controls are measured on the substrates and classified via advanced deep learning techniques that automatically extract informative features to learn generalizable representations. Accuracies up to 99.5% are achieved for metabolite-based analyses, which are verified with an explainable artificial intelligence technique that identifies key spectral features used for classification and for deducing significant biomarkers.
