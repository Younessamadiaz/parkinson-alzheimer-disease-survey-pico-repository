"Extracting ROI-Based Contourlet Subband Energy Feature From the sMRI Image for Alzheimer’s Disease Classification","J. Feng; S. -W. Zhang; L.

Owing to the high dimensionality, representation of the sMRI image becomes a difficult issue in AD classification. Furthermore, regions of interest (ROI) reflected in the sMRI image are not characterized properly by spatial analysis techniques, which has been a main cause of weakening the discriminating ability of the extracted spatial feature. In this study, we propose a ROI-based contourlet subband energy (ROICSE) feature to represent the sMRI image in the frequency domain for AD classification. Specifically, a preprocessed sMRI image is first segmented into 90 ROIs by a constructed brain mask. Instead of extracting features from the 90 ROIs in the spatial domain, the contourlet transform is performed on each of these ROIs to obtain their energy subbands. And then for an ROI, a subband energy (SE) feature vector is constructed to capture its energy distribution and contour information. Afterwards, SE feature vectors of the 90 ROIs are concatenated to form a ROICSE feature of the sMRI image. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify 880 subjects from ADNI and OASIS databases. Experimental results show that the ROICSE approach outperforms six other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that energy and contour information of the ROI are important to capture differences between the sMRI images of AD and HC subjects. Meanwhile, brain regions related to AD can also be found using the ROICSE feature, indicating that the ROICSE feature can be a promising assistant imaging marker for the AD diagnosis via the sMRI image.

"Disease phenotype similarity improves the prediction of novel disease-associated microRNAs","D. -H.

Among them, network-based methods are becoming dominant since they well exploit the “disease module” principle in miRNA functional similarity networks. Of which, Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm-based method on a miRNA functional similarity network, namely RWRMDA, is state-of-the-art one. The use of this algorithm was inspired from its success in predicting disease gene because “disease module” principle also exists in protein interaction networks. Besides, many other algorithms were also designed for prediction of disease genes. However, they have not yet been utilized for disease microRNA prediction. In this study, we proposed a method, namely RWRHMDA, for prediction of disease-associated miRNAs. This method was based on RWRH algorithm, which was successfully proposed for disease gene prediction on a heterogeneous network of genes and disease phenotypes. In particular, we used this algorithm to rank disease candidate miRNAs on a heterogeneous network of phenotypes and miRNAs, which was constructed by integrating a shared target gene-based microRNA functional similarity network and a disease phenotype similarity network. Comparing the prediction performance of RWRHMDA with that of RWRMDA on a set of 35 disease phenotypes, we found that RWRHMDA significantly outperformed RWRMDA irrespective of parameter settings since it better exploited “disease module” principle. In addition, using RWRHMDA method, we identified eight novel Alzheimer's disease-associated miRNAs.","","978-1-4673-6640-3","10.1109/NICS.2015.7302226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7302226","disease-associated miRNA;Random walk with restart algorithm;RWRH;Alzheimer's disease","Prediction algorithms;Alzheimer's disease;Heterogeneous networks;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Proteins","","10","","38","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, two major limitations remain. Amyloid-based diagnostic biomarkers and tests provide limited information about the disease process and they are unable to identify individuals with the disease before significant amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain develops. The objective in this study is to develop a method to identify potential blood-based non-amyloid biomarkers for early AD detection. The use of blood is attractive because it is accessible and relatively inexpensive. Our method is mainly based on machine learning (ML) techniques (support vector machines in particular) because of their ability to create multivariable models by learning patterns from complex data. Using novel feature selection and evaluation modalities, we identified 5 novel panels of non-amyloid proteins with the potential to serve as biomarkers of early AD. In particular, we found that the combination of A2M, ApoE, BNP, Eot3, RAGE and SGOT may be a key biomarker profile of early disease. Disease detection models based on the identified panels achieved sensitivity (SN) > 80%, specificity (SP) > 70%, and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of at least 0.80 at prodromal stage (with higher performance at later stages) of the disease. Existing ML models performed poorly in comparison at this stage of the disease, suggesting that the underlying protein panels may not be suitable for early disease detection.

AD costs about $250 billion annually and affects 5.8 million Americans. Biomarker genomics, based on brain imaging, has been created to better the AD pathogenesis and early diagnosis. Therefore, effective ways to find AD biomarkers for early diagnosis and medication are needed. Conventional diagnostic methods, focused on postmortem findings and clinical symptoms, struggle to understand genetic, molecular, and neuroanatomical interactions. This noninvasive, high-throughput technique addresses these issues by combining genomic data with multimodal imaging phenotypes. The proposed framework introduces Multimodal Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic model (MADM) which integrates Neuroimaging, cognitive assessments, and genetic data to enhance early detection, improve diagnostic accuracy, and personalize treatment strategies. The MADM system analyzes multimodal data, finds illness biomarkers, and predicts progression using powerful AI and ML. This paradigm's thorough and systematic Alzheimer's disease diagnosis includes cognitive test scores, MRI, PET, and genetic indicators including APOE and SNP genotyping. Consolidating data sets is key to precision medicine. This enables targeted therapy and better patient outcomes. Multimodal dementia ratings outperformed MRI and PET scan dementia ratings in predicting MADM progression in healthy control participants, according to ADNI data. In contrast to relying just on genetic data, a combination of neuroimaging, cognitive test scores, and genetic markers was found to be a more effective way to detect patients with stable moderate cognitive impairment. Classification accuracy in the remaining stratified groups was enhanced by combining multimodal data.","","979-8-3315-3669-5","10.1109/ICCIES63851.2025.11032751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11032751","Alzheimer’s Disease;Integrating Neuroimaging;Cognitive Assessments;Genetic Data;Multimodal Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic model","Neuroimaging;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biological system modeling;Genomics;Genetics;Data models;Medical diagnosis;Alzheimer's disease","","","","16","IEEE","17 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, it also causes functional disability as well as impaired memory. It is also stated to be one of the most common reasons for dementia. Therefore, an early and accurate system for the detection and classification of AD is necessary for its treatment and timely intervention. This study carries out a comparative study of three neural network-based machine learning approaches to recognize the most efficient technique in the classification of AD into three distinct classes namely Non-demented, Mildly Demented, and Very Mildly Demented. The main aim of the study is to identify the most robust and effective model for identifying and classifying AD. The three neural network-based machine learning approaches compared in this study are the Basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model, the ConvNeXT-based Model and the Attention-ConvNeXT-based Model. All three models were trained as well as validated by employing a large dataset comprising clinical, demographic, and structural neuroimaging data. The results revealed that, out of all the employed models, the Attention-ConvNeXT-based Model outperformed the other two models in terms of all evaluation metrics. This model had a high accuracy rate and low loss rate. This demonstrates that the use of this model will be effective in the early detection and classification of AD.

Although various imaging modalities are available for individual patients, there is still a lack of research on the creation of multi-modal models that incorporate different modalities. AD is a neurological condition that worsens with time and affects daily activities. It affects memory, cognition, and behavior. AD cannot be cured, but it can be slowed down in its progression and quality of life enhanced with early care. Medical research is using machine learning (ML) more and more to diagnose and track diseases. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be used to detect AD, although it is still challenging to spot subtle changes in the brain in the early stages of the illness. In order to categorize four classes associated with AD symptoms Mild Demented (L-1), Very Mild Demented (L-2), Non-Demented (L-3), and Moderate Demented (L-4) we present a novel CNN architecture in this study. In order to identify the best accurate model, we also evaluate the performance of six ML algorithms. We trained and tested our proposed technique on the DATASET, which consists of 6400 MRI images and is publicly available on Kaggle database.

We investigated the difference in efficiency between the Machine learning models using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data versus models without MRI data. We had around a 3% difference between the best models of these tests. We used the OASIS dataset. We used patients' longitudinal lifestyle data like age, gender, education, income, MMSC score, and other features for Non-MRI models. For MRI models, we also analyzed MRI data along with the lifestyle data. We trained different Machine learning models like Random Forest Classifier, GaussianNB, LinearSVC, Logistic Regression, KNeighbors Classifier, Adaboost Classifier, and several other models. After that, we combined our best models and created a hybrid model. Our best result was 96.07% accuracy with MRI data and 93.37% accuracy without MRI data. The non-MRI result may not be as efficient as the models with the MRI dataset and not crucially inefficient. Our result can be summarized as the Non-MRI data can be used for starting the diagnosis for those poor people.","","978-1-6654-2132-4","10.1109/ICSCT53883.2021.9642536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9642536","Machine learning;Alzheimer’s disease.

Alzheimer's is one of the main problems in elderly people throughout the world. Early detection of Alzheimer's is critical because it allows for better intervention and management to slow the progression of the disease. Cognitive testing and monitoring behavioral changes are the main screening tools for AD. Brain scans using technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) are the gold standard in AD diagnosis. Such imaging can detect structural or metabolic brain changes associated with Alzheimer's. The expertise and experience of medical experts as well as image quality greatly influence detection accuracy. Therefore, in this study, an automatic AD detection method based on MRI images using several neural network architectures is proposed. The proposed system is employed for the classification of non-demented, very mild, mild, and moderate AD. Test results show that 99% accuracy is achieved with the Xception and InceptionResNetV2 architecture.

In this paper, we focus on exploiting deep learning techniques to diagnose AD based on eye-tracking behaviors. Visual attention, as a typical eye-tracking behavior, is of great clinical value in detecting cognitive abnormalities in AD patients. To better analyze the differences in visual attention between AD patients and normals, we first conducted a 3D comprehensive visual task on a noninvasive eye-tracking system to collect visual attention heatmaps. Then a multilayered comparison convolutional neural network (MC-CNN) is proposed to distinguish the visual attention differences between AD patients and normals. In MC-CNN, the multilayered feature representations of heatmaps were obtained by hierarchical residual blocks to better encode eye movement behaviors, which were further integrated into a distance vector to benefit the comprehensive visual task. From evaluation, MC-CNN can distinguish AD patients from normals with 0.84 accuracy, 0.86 recall, 0.82 precision, 0.83 F1-score and 0.90 area under the curve (AUC).

Early detection through computer-aided systems is crucial for effective intervention and treatment, providing automated and highly accurate diagnoses of Alzheimer’s by analyzing brain scans, such as MRI, to assess atrophy in key regions like the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Recently, many researchers have been developing computer-aided AD recognition systems using various technologies. However, existing approaches face challenges in achieving good performance due to difficulties in capturing complex spatial features and handling high-dimensional data. This study proposes a Gradual Variation-Based Dual-Stream Deep Learning (DL) framework for Spatial Feature Enhancement with Dimensionality Reduction to address these challenges. The method begins by converting MRI voxel data into slice images, followed by the extraction of gradual spatial variations based on the Haar Wavelet Transform (WT) to capture large-scale structural changes. These features are processed through a dual-stream DL model, where each stream captures complementary spatial features. The concatenated features are refined using a channel attention (CA) module, which selects the most discriminative features while performing dimensionality reduction to retain only the most important information, eliminating redundant or less informative features. Finally, a DL-based classification module is applied to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. We evaluated the model on two datasets, Complete 1Yr 1.5T and Complete 3Yr 3T, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), using MRI scans from three planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal). The proposed method achieved 99.05% accuracy, 99.05% precision, 99.05% recall, 99.73% ROC-AUC, and 99.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

In fact, Fisher and GA/SVM methods have been merged in order to take benefit from a filtering method as well as an embedded method. The proposed method is tested on DNA microarray gene expression data of Alzheimer's disease. The results show that the proposed method has a good selection and classification performance, which can yield 100% classification accuracy using only 15 genes. From biological point of view, at least 8 (53%) of these genes are Alzheimer associated genes. Thus, these genes not only can serve as predictors of the disease, but also can use as a means to find new candidate genes.","2164-7054","978-1-4799-1972-7","10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7146349","gene selection;genetic algorithm;support vector machines;Fisher;Alzheimer's disease","Support vector machines;Genetic algorithms;Alzheimer's disease;Accuracy;Gene expression;Training","","3","","15","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It's crucial to detect AD in its early stages for proper diagnosis and treatment. The recommended system detect AD in its different stages and provide an intervention system to improve memory and behavior of the patient. The system analyzes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of patient and classify into 4 different stages of AD. MRI is an affordable and widely available imaging technique to assess the volume changes by providing structural details of the brain. The study uses a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and ResNet50 model in conjunction with visualization technique and Reinforcement learning. The proposed system detects the AD stages and suggest cognitive exercises based on the feedback from the user. The model's decisions are visualized by highlighting important MRI image areas, Additionally, the result generated is represented in a web interface for better interpretation. The CNN based model has 97.75 % test accuracy which is higher than most of the current available models. The System uses $\mathrm{Q}$ learning algorithm to develop an intervention system to recommend cognitive exercises for the patient and update recommendations continuously from the feedback received by the reinforcement learning agent. The system also visualizes areas of brain that influenced model's prediction ensuring transparency and reliability.

However, most existing methods construct classifiers using data from one particular target domain (e.g., MCI), and ignore data in other related domains (e.g., AD and normal control (NC)) that may provide valuable information to improve MCI conversion prediction performance. To address is limitation, we develop a novel domain transfer learning method for MCI conversion prediction, which can use data from both the target domain (i.e., MCI) and auxiliary domains (i.e., AD and NC). Specifically, the proposed method consists of three key components: 1) a domain transfer feature selection component that selects the most informative feature-subset from both target domain and auxiliary domains from different imaging modalities; 2) a domain transfer sample selection component that selects the most informative sample-subset from the same target and auxiliary domains from different data modalities; and 3) a domain transfer support vector machine classification component that fuses the selected features and samples to separate MCI-C and MCI-NC patients. We evaluate our method on 202 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) that have MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The experimental results show the proposed method can classify MCI-C patients from MCI-NC patients with an accuracy of 79.4%, with the aid of additional domain knowledge learned from AD and NC.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2404809","NIH(grant numbers:EB008374,EB009634,MH100217,AG041721,AG042599); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61422204,61473149,61473190); Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:BK20130034); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(grant numbers:20123218110009); NUAA Fundamental Research Funds(grant numbers:NE2013105); Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KJ131108); Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); Abbott; AstraZeneca AB; Bayer Schering Pharma AG; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Eisai Global Clinical Development; Elan Corporation; Genentech; GE Healthcare; GlaxoSmithKline; Innogenetics; Johnson and Johnson; Eli Lilly and Co.; Alzheimer's Association and Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; U.S. Food and Drug Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052357","Domain Transfer Learning;Feature Selection;Sample Selection;Mild Cognitive Impairment Converters;Alzheimer's Disease;Alzheimer's disease (AD);domain transfer learning;feature selection;mild cognitive impairment converters (MCI-C);sample selection","Kernel;Magnetic resonance imaging;Positron emission tomography;Alzheimer's disease;Educational institutions;Support vector machines","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alzheimer Disease;Case-Control Studies;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Middle Aged;Mild Cognitive Impairment;Neuroimaging","151","1","58","IEEE","2 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine learning models have been proposed for the diagnosis of AD at early stage. Recently, deep learning architectures have received quite a lot attention. Most of the deep learning architectures suffer from the issues of local minima, slow convergence and sensitivity to learning rate. To overcome these issues, non-iterative learning based deep randomized models especially random vector functional link network (RVFL) with direct links have proven to be successful. However, deep RVFL and its ensemble models are trained only on normal samples. In this paper, deep RVFL and its ensembles are enabled to incorporate privileged information, as the standard RVFL model and its deep models are unable to use privileged information. To fill this gap, we have incorporated learning using privileged information (LUPI) in deep RVFL model, and propose deep RVFL with LUPI framework (dRVFL+). Privileged information is available while training the models. As RVFL is an unstable classifier, we propose ensemble deep RVFL+ with LUPI framework (edRVFL+) which exploits the LUPI as well as the diversity among the base leaners for better classification. Unlike traditional ensemble approach wherein multiple base learners are trained, the proposed edRVFL+ model optimises a single network and generates an ensemble via optimization at different levels of random projections of the data. Both dRVFL+ and edRVFL+ efficiently utilise the privileged information which results in better generalization performance. In LUPI framework, half of the available features are used as normal features and rest as the privileged features. However, we propose a novel approach for generating the privileged information. We utilise different activation functions while processing the normal and privileged information in the proposed deep architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is first time that a separate privileged information is generated. The proposed dRVFL+ and edRVFL+ models are employed for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed dRVFL+ and edRVFL+ models over baseline models. Thus, the proposed edRVFL+ model can be utilised in clinical setting for the diagnosis of AD.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2022.3170351","National Supercomputing Mission(grant numbers:DST/NSM/R&D_HPC_Appl/2021/03.29); Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India(grant numbers:SB/S2/RJN-001/2016); Department of Science and Technology(grant numbers:DST/ICPS/CPS-Individual/2018/276); Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, New Delhi, INDIA(grant numbers:22(0751)/17/EMR-II); IIT Indore; ADNI National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); DOD ADNI; National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; Genentech, Inc.; Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC.; Merck & Co., Inc.; Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Biogen; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC.; NeuroRx Research; EuroImmun; GE Healthcare; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc.; AbbVie, Alzheimer’s Association; Fujirebio; IXICO Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC.; Eli Lilly and Company; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; Lumosity; Lundbeck; Neurotrack Technologies; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; Pfizer Inc.; Piramal Imaging; Servier; Transition Therapeutics.

This problem is commonly posed as a classification task performed by machine learning and deep learning techniques. Although data-driven techniques set the state-of-the-art in many domains, the scale of the available datasets in Alzheimer's research is not sufficient to learn complex models from patient data. This study proposes a simple yet promising framework to predict the conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The proposed framework comprises a shallow neural network for binary classification and a single-step gradient-based adversarial attack to find an adversarial progression direction in the input space. The step size required for the adversarial attack to change a patient's diagnosis from MCI to AD indicates the distance to the decision boundary. The patient's diagnosis at the next visit is predicted by employing this notion of distance to the decision boundary. We also present a potential application of the proposed framework to patient subtyping. Experiments with two publicly available datasets for Alzheimer's disease research imply that the proposed framework can predict MCI-to-AD conversions and assist in subtyping by only training a shallow neural network.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3373703","Boğaziçi University Research Fund(grant numbers:17004); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye ARDEB 3501(grant numbers:121E594); NIA/NIH(grant numbers:U24 AG072122,P30 AG066468,P30 AG062421,P30 AG066509,P30 AG066514,P30 AG066530,P30 AG066507,P30 AG066444,P30 AG066518,P30 AG066512,P30 AG066462,P30 AG072979,P30 AG072972,P30 AG072976,P30 AG072975,P30 AG072978,P30 AG072977,P30 AG066519,P30 AG062677,P30 AG079280,P30 AG062422,P30 AG066511,P30 AG072946,P30 AG062715,P30 AG072973,P30 AG066506,P30 AG066508,P30 AG066515,P30 AG072947,P30 AG072931,P30 AG066546,P20 AG068024,P20 AG068053,P20 AG068077,P20 AG068082,P30 AG072958,P30 AG072959); European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:666992); ADNI National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); Department of Defense(grant numbers:W81XWH-12-2-0012); National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; EuroImmun; F.

We assessed the discrimination ability of WM components between cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia diagnostic groups. Statistical analysis on 13 WM component weights highlighted significant diagnostic contrasts, with 11 components differentiating AD dementia from CN, 10 distinguishing AD dementia from MCI, and 8 distinguishing MCI from CN. Notably, results were replicable, reinforcing the robustness of latent WM sources. Our findings underscore the importance of WM integrity in AD pathology, suggesting WM degeneration as a potentially integral feature of the AD continuum.

A total of 43 plausible causal genes of AD were identified, including eight high-confidence AD causal genes (BIN1, CR1, CLU, HMHA1, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, PICALM and PVR). Then the landscape of these 43 causal genes was generated. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these identified causal genes were enriched in lipid/lipoprotein-related complexes and processes, supporting that lipid/lipoprotein homeostasis has a critical role in AD. The distinct spatial-temporal expression patterns of these causal genes illustrated that they played diverse roles in different cell types and developmental stages. The top eight causal genes were dysregulated in AD cases compared with their expression in normal controls, indicating that these genes are important in the pathophysiology of AD. Results from our study could provide meaningful clues for understanding AD pathogenesis. Together, further functional validation of the causal genes of AD will help identify potential targets for AD therapy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935515","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:21601001,61672037,11835014); Anhui Provincial Outstanding Young Talent Support Plan(grant numbers:gxyqZD2017005); Young Wanjiang Scholar Program of Anhui Province; Recruitment Program for Leading Talent Team of Anhui Province (2019-16); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M630699); Anhui Provincial Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017B325); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8801839","Alzheimer’s disease;causal gene;genome-wide association study;gene expression;expression quantitative trait loci","Gene expression;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Alzheimer's disease","","2","","53","CCBY","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of the existing methods simply excluded subjects with missing data, which unfortunately reduced the sample size. In addition, how to extract and combine multimodal features is still challenging. To address these problems, we propose a deep learning framework to integrate a task-induced pyramid and attention generative adversarial network (TPA-GAN) with a pathwise transfer dense convolution network (PT-DCN) for imputation and classification of multimodal brain images. First, we propose a TPA-GAN to integrate pyramid convolution and attention module as well as disease classification task into GAN for generating the missing PET data with their MRI. Then, with the imputed multimodal images, we build a dense convolution network with pathwise transfer blocks to gradually learn and combine multimodal features for final disease classification.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used to detect Alzheimer's disease as an important tool for assessing and aiding the diagnosis of brain disorders. Accurate diagnosis is essential to prevent progression from early cognitive impairment to AD and to provide early treatment for AD patients. Most classification methods focus only on the time or frequency domain, but ignore the relationship between the two as well as the spatial information of the channels. To address this problem, this paper proposes a feature fusion two-branch parallel network (FFDBPNet) for AD diagnosis, which consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a branch of a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. First, the EEG data are pre-processed and transformed into time-frequency spectrograms, which are dimensionally reduced and fed into the FFDBPNet network. The CNN extracts the time-frequency spectral spatial features of multi-band EEG signals, and the LSTM extracts the time-series features of EEG signals. In addition, a flattening layer is added after the pooling layer to further extract intermediate features to improve the generalisation ability of the model. Finally, feature fusion is performed to obtain the classification results. The classification accuracy of the proposed model for AD EEG signals reaches 96.09%, the sensitivity is 98.04%, and the specificity is 94.14%, which exceeds the traditional classification methods. The experimental results show that the feature fusion model proposed in this paper can extract effective time-frequency features and spatial features from EEG for classification.","","979-8-3315-3571-1","10.1109/ICBEA66055.2025.00011","Tianjin Municipal Education Commission; Tianjin University of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11018712","Alzheimer's disease(AD);EEG;CNN;LSTM;time-frequency analysis","Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy;Network architecture;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease;Long short term memory;Spectrogram","","","","29","IEEE","3 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

NeuroSense employs advanced activity recognition algorithms to passively monitor ambulatory patterns, behaviors, and sleep cycles via Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors from smartwatches (i.e., Apple Watch and Fitbit), including metrics like walking speed, sleep posture, and heart rate variability. NeuroSense leverages enhanced shallow neural networks integrating cross-sectional entropy to dynamically adjust feature weights, improving sensitivity to subtle variations in AD biomarkers. Additionally, the SqueezeNet architecture has been optimized by introducing deeper fire modules and expanding filter sizes, enabling high-resolution feature extraction with reduced computational overhead. These models are further refined with a cloud computing infrastructure, allowing model updation, ensuring adaptive learning based on continuous data influx. To validate its efficacy, NeuroSense was tested on AI-generated datasets, achieving a detection accuracy of 94.4%, substantially higher than existing approaches.

In this paper, an automated digital AD assessment method using Virtual Reality (VR) console is proposed to evaluate patient’s condition by tracking their eye movement during text reading. First, the eye movement pattern is captured using VR console during text reading. The recorded eye movement is then converted into frequency domain to study its frequency components during reading process. The simulation of AD symptom is set up by prompting subjects to read their familiar native language and unfamiliar language. As a result, the experiment shows that there are significant differences in eye movement patterns between native and unfamiliar language reading. The group of subjects reading unfamiliar language have random eye movement in less efficient visual processing. This pattern is similar to the patients who suffer in the AD symptom. In addition, the frequency features are extracted to study its correlations with reading comprehension performance in order to detect the early AD condition.","","979-8-3503-5541-3","10.1109/ICICML63543.2024.10957936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10957936","Alzheimer’s disease;Early diagnosis;Virtual reality;Eye-tracking;Frequency-domain analysis","Visualization;Correlation;Tracking;Frequency-domain analysis;Virtual reality;Manuals;Frequency conversion;Feature extraction;Alzheimer's disease;Medical diagnostic imaging","","","","23","IEEE","14 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite promising insights from neuroimaging into potential AD biomarkers, the intricacy of data interpretation demands advanced computational techniques. Existing diagnostic tools have yet to fully harness the combined strengths of neuroimaging and modern deep-learning architectures for nuanced, early-stage AD classification. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that ensembles three state-of-the-art architectures—EfficientNetB7, Xception, and MobileNetV3Large—through a soft-voting strategy to classify Alzheimer’s disease across multiple stages. Our ensemble methodology deciphers complex patterns within Magnetic Resonance Imaging, mapping them to specific AD early stages. Integrating pre-trained model weights and adaptive learning rates ensures swift convergence and optimal performance. Benchmarking against a comprehensive AD neuro-imaging dataset revealed that our ensemble approach achieves a groundbreaking precision of 99.87%. These results significantly surpass those of individual architectures addressing this problem. Evaluation metrics like precision-recall and f1 score nearly approached 100% across different experiment stages. With inference times as low as 3ms for MobileNetV3Large, our model is highly suitable for real-time deployment in clinical environments. Furthermore, Grad-CAM explainability is incorporated to highlight critical brain regions contributing to the model’s predictions, improving clinical trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ensemble-based deep learning framework combining EfficientNetB7, Xception, and MobileNetV3Large for multi-stage Alzheimer’s classification. The proposed hybrid model can confidently replace conventional diagnostic methods.

Early detection is essential for improving quality of life, as treatment strategies aim to decelerate its progression. AD also impacts fine motor control, including handwriting. Utilizing machine learning (ML) with efficient data analysis methods for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through handwriting analysis holds considerable promise for clinical diagnosis, albeit a challenging undertaking. In this study, we address this complexity by employing ensemble machine learning, which amalgamates diverse ML algorithms to enhance predictive performance. Our approach involves developing an ensemble model for analysis of handwriting kinetics, utilizing the stacking technique to integrate multiple base-level classifiers. The study encompasses 174 individuals, including 89 diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and 85 healthy participants, drawn from the DARWIN dataset (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting). To discern the most effective base classifiers, we employ both Repeated-k-fold and Monte-Carlo Cross Validation techniques. Subsequently, top k features are selected for each best-performing base classifier using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and recursive feature elimination (RFE). The final step involves consolidating predictions from the base classifiers through a stacking ensemble, resulting in an impressive performance. The ensemble model achieves 97.14% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% precision, 97.44% F1-score, 94.37% Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), 94.21% Cohen Kappa, and 97.5% Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Comparative performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed model surpasses all state-of-the-art models based on the DARWIN dataset for Alzheimer’s disease prediction. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning to offer highly accurate predictions for Alzheimer’s disease in an affordable and non-invasive manner, emphasizing its significant clinical utility, particularly through handwriting analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3401104","Kingdom University, Bahrain,(grant numbers:2024-1-001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530648","Alzheimer’s disease prediction;diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth handwriting;ensemble machine learning;handwriting analysis for identifying neurodegenerative disease;machine learning for disease prediction;machine learning based Alzheimer’s disease prediction","Alzheimer's disease;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Solid modeling;Classification algorithms;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","18","","42","CCBYNCND","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the incidence of AD, it’s essential to quantify the AD conversion risk of mild cognitive impaired (MCI) individuals. Here, we propose an AD conversion risk estimation system (CRES), which contains an automated MRI feature extractor, brain age estimation (BAE) module, and AD conversion risk estimation module. The CRES is trained on 634 normal controls (NC) from the public IXI and OASIS cohorts, then it is evaluated on 462 subjects (106 NC, 102 stable MCI (sMCI), 124 progressive MCI (pMCI) and 130 AD) from the ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that the MRI derived age gap (AG, chronological age subtracted from the estimated brain age) significantly distinguish NC, sMCI, pMCI and AD groups with  ${p}$ -value  $=0.000017$ . Considering AG as the primary factor, incorporating gender and Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) for more robust Cox multi-variate hazard analysis, we concluded that each additional year in AG is associated with 4.57% greater AD conversion risk for the MCI group. Furthermore, a nomogram was drawn to describe MCI conversion risk at the individual level in the next 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and even 8 years from baseline. This work demonstrates that CRES can estimate AG based on MRI data, evaluate AD conversion risk of the MCI subjects, and identify the individuals with high AD conversion risk, which is valuable for effective intervention and diagnosis within an early period.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3247590","Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young Scholars; National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFA0706200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62227807,61632014,61627808,12004034); Scientific and Technological Innovation 2030 Project of MOST(grant numbers:2021ZD0202000,2021ZD0200601); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project(grant numbers:2022M720434,2021M690386); Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) and Information Extraction from Images (IXI) for data collection and sharing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10049587","Alzheimer's disease;conversion risk prediction;brain age;cox hazard analysis;nomogram","Estimation;Brain modeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Hazards;Analytical models;Alzheimer's disease;Neuroimaging","Humans;Alzheimer Disease;Cognitive Dysfunction;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Brain;Cognition;Disease Progression","10","","49","CCBY","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, a framework is provided for the categorization of AD, which is comprised of the following steps: data input, model building, hyperparameter tuning, prediction on test data, performance evaluation, and selection of the most effective SVM kernel model and PCA for dimension reduction.

EEG has been extensively employed as a primary diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease (AD), facilitating the assessment and diagnosis of various neurological disorders. An accurate diagnosis is crucial for the prevention of the transition from early cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the provision of early treatment for AD patients. The maj ority of classification methods concentrate solely on the time or frequency domain, thereby neglecting the interconnectivity between the two. Accordingly, this paper generates time- frequency spectrograms based on a wavelet transform for analysis. However, the time-frequency spectrograms contain a considerable amount of redundant information, which results in a sudden increase in computation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a bidirectional principal component analysis (BDPCA) method to reduce the dimensionality of the time- frequency spectrogram, thereby reducing the computational burden while effectively restoring the features of the image. Subsequently, the improved PSO algorithm was employed to select the 16 channels, and seven key channels (Fp1, F7, F8, F3, T3, T4 and 01) were ultimately identified. The features of these selected channels were then inputted into the XGBoost classifier to achieve the recognition of patients and normal controls, with an accuracy rate of 93.56%. This study is the inaugural application of the IMPSO optimisation algorithm and time- frequency spectrogram to EEG channel selection, thereby establishing an efficient framework for AD detection. The method reduces the computational complexity and improves the generalisation ability, which facilitates the rapid identification and reduction of misdiagnosis in a clinical setting while also advancing the understanding of the brain function mechanisms underlying neurological diseases.","","979-8-3315-0739-8","10.1109/CISP-BMEI64163.2024.10906096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10906096","Alzheimer's disease(AD);EEG;time-frequency analysis;PSO;PCA","Wavelet transforms;Neurological diseases;Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy;Signal processing algorithms;Electroencephalography;Classification algorithms;Alzheimer's disease;Spectrogram;Optimization","","","","26","IEEE","7 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, multiple feature types such as hippocampal volume and shape, voxel based morphometry, and cortical thickness based features extracted from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been proved to be effective for the diagnosis of MCI and AD. This work specifically deals with the features calculated from cortical surface. In particular, the techniques based on regional features of cortical surface poorly reveal the spatial variation in the cortical thickness, and the features defined on vertices are noise sensitive due to the large number of dimensions in MRI data. In this study, we present an ensemble classification framework developed on the average and vertex-wise features of cortical thickness. Furthermore, we also combine thickness based features with volume based features of cortex. The features were reduced using F-Score feature selection method prior to classification. The proposed technique has been tested on a dataset of 60 AD, 60 MCI, and 60 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer Disease Neuro imaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and improvement in performance has been observed compared to previously reported studies in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and kappa statistics. The results show that the proposed feature selection coupled with ensemble classification significantly improves performance.","","978-1-5090-5586-9","10.1109/ICOSST.2016.7838581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838581","Cortical thickness;Ensemble;SVM;Alzheimer's disease;Mild cognitive impairment","Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Alzheimer's disease;Sensitivity;Mathematical model;Biomedical measurement","","6","","17","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Depending on the stage, the effects of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) vary from forgetting the names of the surrounding people to not being able to continue daily life without assistance. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no generally accepted diagnostic or treatment methods. In this study, a binary version of the artificial bee colony algorithm (BABC) is proposed as a feature selector for classifying AD from volumetric and statistical data of brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs). MRIs were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Volumetric and statistical data from the collected MRIs were obtained from an online system called volBrain. Then, for comparison, binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), binary grey wolf optimization (BGWO), and binary differential evolution (BDE) were employed. For a comprehensive comparison, three algorithms, K-nearest Neighborhood (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used as classifiers in feature selection progress. The results of this comparison demonstrate that BGWO outperforms BABC, which is a competitive method for this purpose. The outputs of the experiments show that all methods achieve their personal best by using RF as the classifier. Additionally, traditional data mining methods such as the Info Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR), Chi-square (CHI), and ReliefF methods were utilized for comparison. The results also demonstrate the superiority of the BABC over traditional methods. Another research point that this study focused on was to explore which parts of the brain are more relevant for AD diagnosis. The novelty of this study lies in the output of this point. Alongside the hippocampus and amygdala, the globus pallidus can also help in AD diagnosis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3196649","Scientific Research Projects Commission Unit of Adana Alparslan Turkes Science and Technology University(grant numbers:18332001); Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative—ADNI (National Institutes of Health)(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); Department of Defense (DOD) ADNI(grant numbers:W81XWH-12-2-0012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851439","Alzheimer’s disease;artificial bee colony;data mining;feature selection;machine learning;magnetic resonance imaging;swarm intelligence","Magnetic resonance imaging;Support vector machines;Diseases;Feature extraction;Data mining;Alzheimer's disease;Prediction algorithms","","17","","54","CCBYNCND","5 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, the current 3D-CNNs often adopt a single-scale architecture with massive parameters growth. Additionally, obtaining precise location information of brain imaging data is crucial for improving the classification accuracy with 3D-CNN. Hence, we propose a multi-scale 3D-CNN based on coordinate attention mechanism to marvelously capture and integrate 3D features with fewer parameters, improving the accuracy of AD diagnosis. A total of 447 cognitively normal (CN), 512 MCI, and 358 AD sMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative datasets are used for multi-class classification task, yielding a classification accuracy of 92.8%. The model merely involves 2.41 M parameters and achieves the best classification results with the least number of parameters when compared to other representative CNN architectures including ResNet 18, ResNet 34, ConvNeXt tiny, and VGG 11.

Research suggests that the combination of physical and mental exercise reduces the progression of cognitive degeneration. The paper focuses on creating an assistive technology system to promote both physical exercise and cognitive stimulation for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The system incorporates a portable mini stationary bike and an interactive visual multiple choice question game. Physical exercise is provided by the bike while cognitive stimulation is provided by the game that targets areas such as memory, judgment, problem solving, recollection, and matching, to impede dementia. Research has shown that certain multi-sensory stimulants such as fiber optic lights and selective colors can be used to relax and control agitation of patients with dementia.

First, a novel feature selection technique referred to as Neighborhood Component Analysis and Correlation-based Filtration (NCA-F) is proposed to select the vital cognitive features from a given dataset. Second, various machine learning classifiers were trained using the proposed NCA-F method. The top classifiers were selected for voting based on the performance results. The voting is performed using an adaptive weight matrix process. The output label of a model is multiplied by the F1 score and represented as weight. The results revealed an accuracy of 93.92% when using adaptive voting, which is better than the accuracy of 90.53% observed when using the traditional artificial neural network method.

Though various medical procedures and tests, such as MMSE, CDR, eTIV, nWBV, etc., help in identifying the disease, there is no permanent cure for this disease. Hence, a comprehensive model for detecting the disease in an individual in the early stages of the disease is needed. To address this task, this paper uses a few machine learning algorithms to train the model to later classify the patient’s data to perform a medical data analysis and predict the patient’s status, whether the patient has AD, doesn’t have AD, or has the possibility of getting AD in the future.

With time the condition worsens and no proper cure of disease found yet. The aim is to reduce the disease's growth, reduce the signs, address behaviour problems and improve the lifestyle.

However, the availability of labeled datasets for hippocampus regions in MRI images is limited, and manually annotating such images can be expensive and time-consuming task, particularly for large datasets. To overcome this challenge, we propose a deep learning approach that leverages object detection models to automatically identify the hippocampus region in MRI images. In our study, we employed various YOLO-based models to detect and classify the AD classes based on the hippocampus region in MRI images. We specifically selected the latest state-of-the-art YOLO variants, including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7. Our approach shows potential for improving the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease using deep learning and object detection and may be useful for developing automated diagnostic tools for clinical applications. We conducted experiments in two scenarios to validate our proposed idea: one-class detection and two-class detection. One-class detection detects a specific class based on the appearance of the hippocampus region, while two-class detection aims to detect and classify the AD level based on the hippocampus. Our preliminary results demonstrate that YOLO variants are viable for accurately detecting the hippocampus region in MRI images, with potential applications in hippocampus detection.","2770-0496","979-8-3503-0195-3","10.1109/IS3C57901.2023.00017","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10219503","Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Alzheimer’s disease detection;YOLO;hippocampus region;automatic labeling","Deep learning;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Magnetic resonance;Object detection;Object recognition;Labeling","","6","","18","IEEE","23 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early diagnosis of AD is essential for the progress of more prevailing treatments. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, employs a variety of probabilistic and optimization techniques that permits PCs to gain from vast and complex datasets. As a result, researchers focus on using machine learning frequently for diagnosis of early stages of AD. This paper presents a review, analysis and critical evaluation of the recent work done for the early detection of AD using ML techniques. Several methods achieved promising prediction accuracies, however they were evaluated on different pathologically unproven data sets from different imaging modalities making it difficult to make a fair comparison among them. Moreover, many other factors such as pre-processing, the number of important attributes for feature selection, class imbalance distinctively affect the assessment of the prediction accuracy. To overcome these limitations, a model is proposed which comprise of initial pre-processing step followed by imperative attributes selection and classification is achieved using association rule mining. Furthermore, this proposed model based approach gives the right direction for research in early diagnosis of AD and has the potential to distinguish AD from healthy controls.","","978-9-8975-8164-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7526944","Alzheimer's Disease;Machine Learning;Computer Aided Diagnosis;Pathologically Proven Data;Early Diagnosis;Class Imbalance","Alzheimer's disease;Positron emission tomography;Data mining;Single photon emission computed tomography;Support vector machines;Standards","","5","","12","","1 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep learning techniques have great potential to classify the disease, but there are still some challenges: images of Alzheimer's disease are very similar to those of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and it is difficult to classify the disease by images only; many studies have focused on binary classification, but few have performed multi-classification for the progressive stages of the disease. In this paper, we proposed a new multi-classification method: Firstly, the ConvNeXt network is employed to extract features from AD images. Next, the subject's identity information is parameterized using Dynamic Multilayer Perceptron (DMLP) and projected onto the image features to enhance them. Finally, the multi-classification is performed using fully connected layers and softmax layers. Experiments demonstrate that the method shows higher accuracy than classical methods in multi-classification tasks, and also provides a method for deeper understanding and diagnosis of AD.","","979-8-3503-2538-6","10.1109/ISCTIS58954.2023.10213046","Southwest Minzu University(grant numbers:ZD2022600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10213046","Alzheimer's disease;Multi-classification;Deep learning","Computed tomography;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Multilayer perceptrons;Feature extraction;Data models","","6","","17","IEEE","16 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for effective treatment and intervention. In recent years, deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have emerged as powerful tools for automated disease diagnosis from medical imaging data. This abstract presents a promising approach utilizing deep learning and CNNs for Alzheimer’s detection. The proposed method involves leveraging neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, to develop a reliable and automated AD diagnostic system. Initially, the MRI scans are pre-processed to enhance image quality and remove noise. Subsequently, a CNN architecture is designed and trained using a large dataset of both AD and non-AD images. The CNN learns intricate features and patterns directly from the data, enabling it to distinguish AD- related structural abnormalities and identify potential biomarkers. The trained CNN model is then employed for AD diagnosis by inputting new, unseen MRI scans. The model applies its learned knowledge to extract relevant features from the input images and generates a diagnostic output indicating the likelihood of AD presence. The diagnostic output can be further validated and interpreted by medical professionals, assisting them in making informed decisions regarding patient care and treatment strategies.","","979-8-3503-0692-7","10.1109/ICRASET59632.2023.10420351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10420351","Image Processing (IP);Alzheimer’s disease(AD);Stem cell;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","Deep learning;Neuroimaging;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biological system modeling;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease","","1","","20","IEEE","8 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
