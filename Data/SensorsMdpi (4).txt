Leveraging NGS technology, early metagenomic studies revealed that several diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism, and myalgic encephalomyelitis, are characterized by alterations in the diversity of gut-associated microbes. More recently, interest has shifted toward understanding how these microbes impact their host, with a special emphasis on their interactions with the brain. Such interactions typically occur either systemically, through the production of small molecules in the gut that are released into circulation, or through signaling via the vagus nerves which directly connect the enteric nervous system to the central nervous system. Collectively, this system of communication is now commonly referred to as the gut-microbiota-brain axis. While equally important, little attention has focused on the causes of the alterations in the composition of gut microbiota. Although several factors can contribute, mucosal immunity plays a significant role in shaping the microbiota in both healthy individuals and in association with several diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the components of mucosal immunity that impact the gut microbiota and then discuss how altered immunological conditions may shape the gut microbiota and consequently affect neuroimmune diseases, using a select group of common neuroimmune diseases as examples.

Recently, virtual reality and exergaming have been emerged as promising tools for gait and balance rehabilitation in PD patients. Our purpose is to evaluate an innovative treatment for older patients with PD, based on non-immersive virtual reality exergames, improving gait and balance and reducing falling risk. (2) Methods: Thirty PD patients were recruited and randomly divided into two groups, to receive a traditional rehabilitation (CG) or a technological rehabilitation (TG). (3) Results: A statistical improvement of balance at the end of treatments was observed in both groups (CG: 12.4 ± 0.7 vs. 13.5 ± 0.8, p = 0.017; TG: 13.8 ± 0.5 vs. 14.7 ± 0.4, p = 0.004), while the overall risk of falling was significantly reduced only in the TG (POMA Total: 24.6 ± 0.9 vs. 25.9 ± 0.7, p = 0.010). The results between groups shows that all POMA scores differ in a statistically significant manner in the TG, emphasizing improvement not only in balance but also in gait characteristics (9.7 ± 0.8 vs. 11.4 ± 0.2, p = 0.003). Moreover, TG also improves the psychological sphere, measured thorough MSC-(17.1 ± 0.4 vs. 16.5 ± 0.4, p = 0.034). Although an improvement in FES-I and Gait Speed can be observed, this increase does not turn out to be significant. (4) Conclusions: Results suggest how non-immersive virtual reality exergaming technology offers the opportunity to effectively train cognitive and physical domains at the same time.

Cognitive training seems effective for cognitive status and for mitigating anxiety and depression. With the COVID-19 outbreak, such therapeutic interventions were delivered online. This longitudinal mixed-method study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of an online cognitive treatment, carried out during COVID times and based on Parkinson’s-Adapted Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, on cognitive domains and mood of 18 older people with Parkinson’s disease. After screening, the cognitive status and mood were assessed three times by Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form. At the follow-up, patients were also interviewed for understanding their experience with the technology. Such treatment was effective on the participants’ cognitive functions, but not on their mood. Despite some initial problems with the technology, the online intervention was experienced as a way of not being ‘left behind’, staying in contact with others, and being safe during the lockdown. This suggests that online cognitive treatment can be adopted to integrate face-to-face interventions by increasing their efficacy, accessibility, and long-term outcomes. Suggestions for future research are given.

We have developed an approach for clinical speech signal processing to demonstrate the promise of deep learning-driven voice analysis as a screening tool for Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the world’s second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Detecting Parkinson’s disease symptoms typically involves an evaluation by a movement disorder expert, which can be difficult to get and yield varied findings. A vocal digital biomarker might supplement the time-consuming traditional manual examination by recognizing and evaluating symptoms that characterize voice quality and level of deterioration. We present a deep learning based, custom U-lossian model for PD assessment and recognition. The study’s goal was to discover anomalies in the PD-affected voice and develop an automated screening method that can discriminate between the voices of PD patients and healthy volunteers while also providing a voice quality score. The classification accuracy was evaluated on two speech corpora (Italian PVS and own Lithuanian PD voice dataset) and we have found the result to be medically appropriate, with values of 0.8964 and 0.7949, confirming the proposed model’s high generalizability.

Rastegari, Elham; Ali, Hesham; Marmelat, Vivien	Detection of Parkinson’s Disease Using Wrist Accelerometer Data and Passive Monitoring	Sensors	EN	Article	Parkinson’s disease; wearable accelerometer; early detection; passive monitoring	Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder impacting patients’ movement, causing a variety of movement abnormalities. It has been the focus of research studies for early detection based on wearable technologies. The benefit of wearable technologies in the domain rises by continuous monitoring of this population’s movement patterns over time. The ubiquity of wrist-worn accelerometry and the fact that the wrist is the most common and acceptable body location to wear the accelerometer for continuous monitoring suggests that wrist-worn accelerometers are the best choice for early detection of the disease and also tracking the severity of it over time. In this study, we use a dataset consisting of one-week wrist-worn accelerometry data collected from individuals with Parkinson’s disease and healthy elderlies for early detection of the disease. Two feature engineering methods, including epoch-based statistical feature engineering and the document-of-words method, were used. Using various machine learning classifiers, the impact of different windowing strategies, using the document-of-words method versus the statistical method, and the amount of data in terms of number of days were investigated. Based on our results, PD was detected with the highest average accuracy value (85% ± 15%) across 100 runs of SVM classifier using a set of features containing features from every and all windowing strategies. We also found that the document-of-words method significantly improves the classification performance compared to the statistical feature engineering model. Although the best performance of the classification task between PD and healthy elderlies was obtained using seven days of data collection, the results indicated that with three days of data collection, we can reach a classification performance that is not significantly different from a model built using seven days of data collection.

In this clinical trial, the feasibility and safety of BBB modulation in the putamen were evaluated for biweekly therapeutic agent delivery in patients with Parkinson’s disease. The performance of the clinical MRgFUS system’s cavitation feedback controller for active power modulation throughout the exposures was examined. The putamen was targeted unilaterally by an ExAblate Neuro MRgFUS system operating at 220 kHz. Definity microbubbles were infused via a saline bag gravity drip at a rate of 4 µL/kg per 5 min. A cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was employed to modulate the acoustic power automatically according to prescribed target cavitation dose levels. BBB opening was measured by Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging, and the presence of potential micro-hemorrhages induced by the exposures was assessed via T2*-weighted MR imaging. A total of 12 treatment sessions were carried out across four patients, with target cavitation dose levels ranging from 0.20–0.40. BBB permeability in the targeted putamen was elevated successfully in all treatments, with a 14% ± 6% mean increase in Gd-enhanced T1-weighted MRI signal intensity relative to the untreated contralateral side. No indications of red blood cell extravasations were observed on MR imaging scans acquired one day following each treatment session. The cavitation emissions-based feedback controller was effective in modulating acoustic power levels to ensure BBB permeability enhancement while avoiding micro-hemorrhages, however, further technical advancements are warranted to improve its performance for use across a wide variety of brain diseases.

Kim, Min; Ho, Myoung; Joung, Min; Choi, Yong; Kang, Myung	Effect of Dispersion Medium on Pharmacokinetic Profile of Rotigotine Crystalline Suspension following Subcutaneous Injection	Pharmaceutics	EN	Article	Rotigotine; parenteral long-acting delivery; crystalline suspension; dispersion medium; pharmacokinetics; local distribution; local inflammation	Rotigotine (RTG) is prescribed as a once-daily transdermal patch for managing early Parkinson’s disease (PD), which presents issues such as skin irritation and poor patient adherence. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to formulate aqueous and oily vehicle-based RTG crystalline suspensions for prolonged delivery and to compare their pharmacokinetic profiles and the local behaviors of RTG crystals. RTG-loaded aqueous (AS) and oil suspensions (OS) were fabricated using bead-milling technology (100 mg/mL as RTG), employing carboxymethyl cellulose and sesame oil as suspending agent and oily vehicle, respectively. RTG AS and OS exhibited comparable physical properties in terms of particle size (about 800–900 nm), crystallinity, and dissolution profile, despite higher drug solubility in OS than AS (19.6 and 0.07 mg/mL, respectively). However, AS and OS exhibited markedly distinctive local distribution and inflammatory responses at the injection site, which further promoted different pharmacokinetic patterns following subcutaneous injection in rats. With OS, no drug aggregates were observed with prolonged persistence of the Sudan III-stained oily vehicle at the injection site. In contrast, with AS injection, drug clusters > 7 mm were formed, followed by an enclosure with macrophages and a fibroblastic band. Accordingly, AS exhibited a protracted pharmacokinetic profile over 3 weeks, with prolonged elimination half-life. The local inflammatory response caused by AS injection was almost alleviated after 3 weeks post-dosing. Based on these findings, we conclude that RTG AS system can be a platform to design sophisticated long-acting delivery systems with extended dosing intervals to manage PD.

Mezzina, Giovanni; De Venuto, Daniela	A Digital Architecture for the Real-Time Tracking of Wearing off Phenomenon in Parkinson’s Disease	Sensors	EN	Article	EEG; EMG; heterogeneous computing platform; wearing off; Parkinson’s Disease	Levodopa administration is currently the most common treatment to alleviate Parkinson’s Disease (PD) symptoms. Nevertheless, prolonged use of Levodopa leads to a wearing-off (WO) phenomenon, causing symptoms to reappear. To build a personalized treatment plan aiming to manage PD and its symptoms effectively, there is a need for a technological system able to continuously and objectively assess the WO phenomenon during daily life. In this context, this paper proposes a WO tracker able to exploit neuromuscular data acquired by a dedicated wireless sensor network to discriminate between a Levodopa benefit phase and the reappearance of symptoms. The proposed architecture has been implemented on a heterogeneous computing platform, that statistically analyzes neural and muscular features to identify the best set of features to train the classifier model. Eight models among shallow and deep learning approaches are analyzed in terms of performance, timing and complexity metrics to identify the best inference engine. Experimental results on five subjects experiencing WO, showed that, in the best case, the proposed WO tracker can achieve an accuracy of ~84%, providing the inference in less than 41 ms. It is possible by employing a simple fully-connected neural network with 1 hidden layer and 32 units.

The proposed system has three major functions. The first function is two-channel surface electromyography (EMG) signal measurement and processing for the vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) muscles using a developed EMG device set. The second function is the knee extension range of motion (ROM) measurement using an angle sensor device set (i.e., accelerometer sensor). Both functions are connected and parallelly processed by the NI-myRIO embedded device. Finally, the third function is the graphical user interface (GUI) using LabVIEW, where the knee rehabilitation program can be defined and flexibly set, as recommended by physical therapists and physicians. Experimental results obtained from six healthy subjects demonstrated that the proposed system can efficiently work with real-time response. It can support multiple rehabilitation users with data collection, where EMG signals with mean absolute value (MAV) and root mean square value (RMS) results and knee extension ROM data can be automatically measured and recorded based on the defined rehabilitation program. Furthermore, the proposed system is also employed in the hospital for validation and evaluation, where bio-feedback EMG and ROM data from six patients, including (a) knee osteoarthritis, (b) herniated disc, (c) knee ligament injury, (d) ischemic stroke, (e) hemorrhagic stroke, and (f) Parkinson are obtained. Such data are also collected for one month for tracking, evaluation, and treatment. With our proposed system, results indicate that the rehabilitation people can practice themselves and know their rehabilitation progress during the time of testing. The system can also evaluate (as a primary treatment) whether the therapy training is successful or not, while experts can simultaneously review the progress and set the optimal treatment program in response to the rehabilitation users. This technology can also be integrated as a part of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart healthcare systems.

Participants performed a 2-min walk overground before and after 15 min of treadmill training with Mobility Rehab, which included an electronic tablet (to visualize gait metrics) and five Opal sensors placed on both the wrists and feet and on the sternum area to measure gait and provide feedback on six gait metrics (foot-strike angle, trunk coronal range-of-motion (ROM), arm swing ROM, double-support duration, gait-cycle duration, and step asymmetry). The physical therapist used Mobility Rehab to select one or two gait metrics (from the six) to focus on during the treadmill training. Foot-strike angle (effect size (ES) = 0.56, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.14 to 0.97), trunk coronal RoM (ES = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.73 to 2.06), and arm swing RoM (ES = 1.64, 95% CI = 0.71 to 2.58) during overground walking showed significant and moderate-to-large ES following treadmill training with Mobility Rehab. Participants perceived moderate (60%) and excellent (30%) effects of Mobility Rehab on their gait. No adverse events were reported. One session of treadmill training with Mobility Rehab is feasible for people with mild-to-moderate PD.

The low efficiency of therapy is due to the late diagnosis and treatment of PD, which take place when there is already significant degradation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, a key link in the regulation of motor function. We have developed a subchronic mouse model of PD by repeatedly administering 1–methyl–4–phenyl–1,2,3,6–tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) at gradually increasing doses with a 24 h interval between injections, a period comparable to the time of MPTP metabolism and elimination from the body. This model reproduces the main hallmarks of PD: progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons; the appearance of motor disorders with a 70–80% decrease in the level of dopamine in the striatum; an increase in dopamine turnover in the striatum to compensate for dopamine deficiency. When comparing the degradation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and motor disorders in mice in the acute and subchronic models of PD, it has turned out that the resistance of dopaminergic neurons to MPTP increases with its repeated administration. Our subchronic model of PD opens up broad prospects for studying the molecular mechanisms of PD pathogenesis and developing technologies for early diagnosis and preventive treatment.

Prieto-Avalos, Guillermo; Sánchez-Morales, Laura; Alor-Hernández, Giner; Sánchez-Cervantes, José	A Review of Commercial and Non-Commercial Wearables Devices for Monitoring Motor Impairments Caused by Neurodegenerative Diseases	Biosensors	EN	Review	neurodegenerative diseases; monitoring; sensors; wearables	Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are among the 10 causes of death worldwide. The effects of NDDs, including irreversible motor impairments, have an impact not only on patients themselves but also on their families and social environments. One strategy to mitigate the pain of NDDs is to early identify and remotely monitor related motor impairments using wearable devices. Technological progress has contributed to reducing the hardware complexity of mobile devices while simultaneously improving their efficiency in terms of data collection and processing and energy consumption. However, perhaps the greatest challenges of current mobile devices are to successfully manage the security and privacy of patient medical data and maintain reasonable costs with respect to the traditional patient consultation scheme. In this work, we conclude: (1) Falls are most monitored for Parkinson’s disease, while tremors predominate in epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. These findings will provide guidance for wearable device manufacturers to strengthen areas of opportunity that need to be addressed, and (2) Of the total universe of commercial wearables devices that are available on the market, only a few have FDA approval, which means that there is a large number of devices that do not safeguard the integrity of the users who use them.

This paper introduces the preliminary results of an innovative research project aiming to develop an mHealth system including Android smart glasses, and providing multisensory cues for gait rehabilitation of people affected by Parkinson’s disease in and out of the medical context. In particular, the paper describes a preliminary pilot focusing on the design of visual, auditory, and haptic cues, and testing the design methodologies to be used in further developments of the project. Considered research questions were: Which kinds of images, sounds, and vibrations mostly influence gait speed, stride length, and cadence? Which are the ones stressing the user the least? Which ones induce the most immediate reaction? Thus, in this starting part of the research project, different typologies of sensory cues were designed, tested, and evaluated considering quantitative and qualitative parameters to properly answer the research questions.

Bhachawat, Saransh; Shriram, Eashwar; Srinivasan, Kathiravan; Hu, Yuh-Chung	Leveraging Computational Intelligence Techniques for Diagnosing Degenerative Nerve Diseases: A Comprehensive Review, Open Challenges, and Future Research Directions	Diagnostics	EN	Review	degenerative nerve diseases; neurodegenerative disorder; machine learning; deep learning; progressive brain diseases; diagnosis	Degenerative nerve diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases have always been a global issue of concern. Approximately 1/6th of the world’s population suffers from these disorders, yet there are no definitive solutions to cure these diseases after the symptoms set in. The best way to treat these disorders is to detect them at an earlier stage. Many of these diseases are genetic; this enables machine learning algorithms to give inferences based on the patient’s medical records and history. Machine learning algorithms such as deep neural networks are also critical for the early identification of degenerative nerve diseases. The significant applications of machine learning and deep learning in early diagnosis and establishing potential therapies for degenerative nerve diseases have motivated us to work on this review paper. Through this review, we covered various machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their application in the diagnosis of degenerative nerve diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, we also included the recent advancements in each of these models, which improved their capabilities for classifying degenerative nerve diseases. The limitations of each of these methods are also discussed. In the conclusion, we mention open research challenges and various alternative technologies, such as virtual reality and Big data analytics, which can be useful for the diagnosis of degenerative nerve diseases.

It is still unknown how gene expression changes in single-cell in different spatial locations of the hippocampus of Parkinson’s disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze the gene expression features of single cells in different spatial locations of mouse hippocampus, and to explore the effects of gene expression regulation on learning and memory mechanisms. Here, we obtained 74 single-cell samples from different spatial locations in a mouse hippocampus through microdissection technology, and used single-cell RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptome sequencing to visualize and quantify the single-cell transcriptome features of tissue sections. The results of differential expression analysis showed that the expression of Sv2b, Neurod6, Grp and Stk32b genes in a hippocampus single cell at different locations was significantly different, and the marker genes of CA1, CA3 and DG subregions were identified. The results of gene function enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated differentially expressed genes Tubb2a, Eno1, Atp2b1, Plk2, Map4, Pex5l, Fibcd1 and Pdzd2 were mainly involved in neuron to neuron synapse, vesicle-mediated transport in synapse, calcium signaling pathway and neurodegenerative disease pathways, thus affecting learning and memory function. It revealed the transcriptome profile and heterogeneity of spatially located cells in the hippocampus of PD for the first time, and demonstrated that the impaired learning and memory ability of PD was affected by the synergistic effect of CA1 and CA3 subregions neuron genes. These results are crucial for understanding the pathological mechanism of the Parkinson’s disease and making precise treatment plans.

In recent years, motor measurements gathered by technology-based systems have been used more and more to provide objective data. In particular, wearable devices have been adopted to evidence differences in the gait capabilities between PD patients and healthy people. Within this frame, despite the key role that the upper limbs’ swing plays during walking, no studies have been focused on their harmonic content, to which this work is devoted. To this end, we measured, by means of IMU sensors, the walking capabilities of groups of PD patients (both de novo and under-chronic-dopaminergic-treatment patients when in an off-therapy state) and their healthy counterparts. The collected data were FFT transformed, and the frequency content was analyzed. According to the results obtained, PD determines upper limb rigidity objectively evidenced and correlated to lower harmonic contents.

Yeap, Yee; Teddy, Tng; Lee, Mok; Goh, Micaela; Lim, Kah	From 2D to 3D: Development of Monolayer Dopaminergic Neuronal and Midbrain Organoid Cultures for Parkinson’s Disease Modeling and Regenerative Therapy	International Journal of Molecular Sciences	EN	Review	Parkinson’s Disease; pluripotent stem cells; dopaminergic neurons; organoids; mesencephalon; midbrain; microfluidic; clinical trial; allogeneic transplantation; regenerative medicine	Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized pathologically by the loss of A9-specific dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the midbrain. Despite intensive research, the etiology of PD is currently unresolved, and the disease remains incurable. This, in part, is due to the lack of an experimental disease model that could faithfully recapitulate the features of human PD. However, the recent advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has allowed PD models to be created from patient-derived cells. Indeed, DA neurons from PD patients are now routinely established in many laboratories as monolayers as well as 3D organoid cultures that serve as useful toolboxes for understanding the mechanism underlying PD and also for drug discovery. At the same time, the iPSC technology also provides unprecedented opportunity for autologous cell-based therapy for the PD patient to be performed using the patient’s own cells as starting materials. In this review, we provide an update on the molecular processes underpinning the development and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into midbrain DA neurons in both 2D and 3D cultures, as well as the latest advancements in using these cells for drug discovery and regenerative medicine. For the novice entering the field, the cornucopia of differentiation protocols reported for the generation of midbrain DA neurons may seem daunting. Here, we have distilled the essence of the different approaches and summarized the main factors driving DA neuronal differentiation, with the view to provide a useful guide to newcomers who are interested in developing iPSC-based models of PD.

Dixit, Shriniket; Bohre, Khitij; Singh, Yashbir; Himeur, Yassine; Mansoor, Wathiq; Atalla, Shadi; Srinivasan, Kathiravan	A Comprehensive Review on AI-Enabled Models for Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis	Electronics	EN	Review	Parkinson’s disease; computational intelligence; deep learning; diagnosis; machine learning; smartphone; augmented reality; virtual reality	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a devastating neurological disease that cannot be identified with traditional plasma experiments, necessitating the development of a faster, less expensive diagnostic instrument. Due to the difficulty of quantifying PD in the past, doctors have tended to focus on some signs while ignoring others, primarily relying on an intuitive assessment scale because of the disease’s characteristics, which include loss of motor control and speech that can be utilized to detect and diagnose this disease. It is an illness that impacts both motion and non-motion functions. It takes years to develop and has a wide range of clinical symptoms and prognoses. Parkinson’s patients commonly display non-motor symptoms such as sleep problems, neurocognitive ailments, and cognitive impairment long before the diagnosis, even though scientists have been working to develop designs for diagnosing and categorizing the disease, only noticeable defects such as movement patterns, speech, or writing skills are offered in this paper. This article provides a thorough analysis of several AI-based ML and DL techniques used to diagnose PD and their influence on developing additional research directions. It follows the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). This review also examines the current state of PD diagnosis and the potential applications of data-driven AI technology. It ends with a discussion of future developments, which aids in filling critical gaps in the current Parkinson’s study.

The meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) are an important part of the BWRS. A decrease in MLV function is associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, intracranial hemorrhages, brain tumors and trauma. Since the BWRS is activated during sleep, a new idea is now being actively discussed in the scientific community: night stimulation of the BWRS might be an innovative and promising strategy for neurorehabilitation medicine. This review highlights new trends in photobiomodulation of the BWRS/MLVs during deep sleep as a breakthrough technology for the effective removal of wastes and unnecessary compounds from the brain in order to increase the neuroprotection of the CNS as well as to prevent or delay various brain diseases.

Vilairat, Chayarit; Kobtrakul, Khwanlada; Vimolmangkang, Sornkanok	Enhanced Physicochemical Stability of the L-DOPA Extract of Mucuna pruriens Seeds by Adding Phyllanthus emblica	Molecules	EN	Article	levodopa; mung bean; amla fruit; green technology; Parkinson’s disease	Levodopa (L-DOPA) is an essential drug for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. Currently, L-DOPA can be produced by chemical synthesis and can also be found naturally in many herbs, especially Mucuna Pruriens (MP). According to clinical research, the MP extract containing L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease could reduce side effects more than the synthetic one. Unfortunately, MP extracts can be easily degraded. Changes in physical and chemical properties such as the appearance (color, melt, solid lump) and the reduction of L-DOPA content in the extract were commonly observed. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an extraction procedure to stabilize the extract of L-DOPA. This study attempted to enhance the extraction process by modifying the traditional acidification approach using hydrochloric acid, citric acid, or ascorbic acid. According to the stability test results, using Phyllanthus emblica water (PEW) as a solvent improved the preservative properties more than other solvents. The color of the PEW-MP powder changed slightly after 12 months of accelerated storage, but the amount of L-DOPA remained the highest (73.55%). Moreover, L-DOPA was only detected in MP and PEW-MP, but not PEW alone (the HPTLC chromatogram at Rf 0.48 and the HPLC chromatogram at Rt 6.0 min). The chemical profiles of PEW and L-DOPA observed in the chromatograms indicated that they are independently separated. As a result, they can be applied to a quality control process. Therefore, PEW was proven to be a powerful solvent for L-DOPA herbal extract that could be readily used as a raw material for herbal products.

The most common are Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease; in both cases, diagnosis is based on clinical tests with limited capability to discriminate between similar neurodegenerative disorders and detect the early stages of the disease. It is common that by the time a patient is diagnosed with the disease, the level of neurodegeneration is already severe. Thus, it is critical to find new diagnostic methods that allow earlier and more accurate disease detection. This study reviews the methods available for the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and potentially interesting new technologies. Neuroimaging techniques are the most widely used in clinical practice, and new techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have significantly improved the diagnosis quality. Identifying biomarkers in peripheral samples such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid is a major focus of the current research on neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery of good markers could allow preventive screening to identify early or asymptomatic stages of the neurodegenerative process. These methods, in combination with artificial intelligence, could contribute to the generation of predictive models that will help clinicians in the early diagnosis, stratification, and prognostic assessment of patients, leading to improvements in patient treatment and quality of life.

Telerehabilitation operates over a distance, so vulnerable patients are never exposed to unnecessary risks. Despite its low cost, the need for a professional to assess therapeutic exercises and proper corporal movements online should also be mentioned. The focus of this paper is on a telerehabilitation system for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease in remote villages and other less accessible locations. A full-stack is presented using big data frameworks that facilitate communication between the patient and the occupational therapist, the recording of each session, and real-time skeleton identification using artificial intelligence techniques. Big data technologies are used to process the numerous videos that are generated during the course of treating simultaneous patients. Moreover, the skeleton of each patient can be estimated using deep neural networks for automated evaluation of corporal exercises, which is of immense help to the therapists in charge of the treatment programs.

We review the physiology of bowel sound production, the developments in recording technologies and the clinical application in various scenarios, to understand the potential of a bowel sound recording and analysis device—the phonoenterogram in future gastroenterological practice. Bowel sound production depends on but is not entirely limited to the type of food consumed, amount of air ingested and the type of intestinal contractions. Recording technologies for extraction and analysis of these include the wavelet-based filtering, autoregressive moving average model, multivariate empirical mode decompression, radial basis function network, two-dimensional positional mapping, neural network model and acoustic biosensor technique. Prior studies evaluate the application of bowel sounds in conditions such as intestinal obstruction, acute appendicitis, large bowel disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and bowel polyps, ascites, post-operative ileus, sepsis, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and neonatal conditions such as hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Recording and analysis of bowel sounds using artificial intelligence is crucial for creating an accessible, inexpensive and safe device with a broad range of clinical applications. Microwave-based digital phonoenterography has huge potential for impacting GI practice and patient care.

Therefore, a number of immunotherapeutic approaches targeting the non-functional or toxic proteins that induce neurodegeneration in NDDs have been designed in the last decades. In this context, due to unprecedented advances in genetic engineering techniques and molecular farming technology, pioneering plant-based immunogenic antigen expression systems have been developed aiming to offer reliable alternatives to deal with important NDDs, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. Diverse reports have evidenced that plant-made vaccines trigger significant immune responses in model animals, supported by the production of antibodies against the aberrant proteins expressed in the aforementioned NDDs. Moreover, these immunogenic tools have various advantages that make them a viable alternative for preventing and treating NDDs, such as high scalability, no risk of contamination with human pathogens, cold chain free production, and lower production costs. Hence, this article presents an overview of the current progress on plant-manufactured vaccines for NDDs and discusses its future prospects.

PD has not only been intrinsically related to neurological problems, but also to a series of alterations in peripheral metabolism. The purpose of this study was to identify metabolic changes in the liver in mouse models of PD with the scope of finding new peripheral biomarkers for PD diagnosis. To achieve this goal, we used mass spectrometry technology to determine the complete metabolomic profile of liver and striatal tissue samples from WT mice, 6-hydroxydopamine-treated mice (idiopathic model) and mice affected by the G2019S-LRRK2 mutation in LRRK2/PARK8 gene (genetic model). This analysis revealed that the metabolism of carbohydrates, nucleotides and nucleosides was similarly altered in the liver from the two PD mouse models. However, long-chain fatty acids, phosphatidylcholine and other related lipid metabolites were only altered in hepatocytes from G2019S-LRRK2 mice. In summary, these results reveal specific differences, mainly in lipid metabolism, between idiopathic and genetic PD models in peripheral tissues and open up new possibilities to better understand the etiology of this neurological disorder.

Ravichandran, Vignesh; Sadhu, Shehjar; Convey, Daniel; Guerrier, Sebastien; Chomal, Shubham; Dupre, Anne-Marie; Akbar, Umer; Solanki, Dhaval; Mankodiya, Kunal	iTex Gloves: Design and In-Home Evaluation of an E-Textile Glove System for Tele-Assessment of Parkinson’s Disease	Sensors	EN	Article	Internet of Things; telemedicine; e-textiles; wearable sensors; smart gloves; Parkinson’s disease	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurological progressive movement disorder, affecting more than 10 million people globally. PD demands a longitudinal assessment of symptoms to monitor the disease progression and manage the treatments. Existing assessment methods require patients with PD (PwPD) to visit a clinic every 3–6 months to perform movement assessments conducted by trained clinicians. However, periodic visits pose barriers as PwPDs have limited mobility, and healthcare cost increases. Hence, there is a strong demand for using telemedicine technologies for assessing PwPDs in remote settings. In this work, we present an in-home telemedicine kit, named iTex (intelligent Textile), which is a patient-centered design to carry out accessible tele-assessments of movement symptoms in people with PD. iTex is composed of a pair of smart textile gloves connected to a customized embedded tablet. iTex gloves are integrated with flex sensors on the fingers and inertial measurement unit (IMU) and have an onboard microcontroller unit with IoT (Internet of Things) capabilities including data storage and wireless communication. The gloves acquire the sensor data wirelessly to monitor various hand movements such as finger tapping, hand opening and closing, and other movement tasks. The gloves are connected to a customized tablet computer acting as an IoT device, configured to host a wireless access point, and host an MQTT broker and a time-series database server. The tablet also employs a patient-centered interface to guide PwPDs through the movement exam protocol. The system was deployed in four PwPDs who used iTex at home independently for a week. They performed the test independently before and after medication intake. Later, we performed data analysis of the in-home study and created a feature set. The study findings reported that the iTex gloves were capable to collect movement-related data and distinguish between pre-medication and post-medication cases in a majority of the participants. The IoT infrastructure demonstrated robust performance in home settings and offered minimum barriers for the assessment exams and the data communication with a remote server. In the post-study survey, all four participants expressed that the system was easy to use and poses a minimum barrier to performing the test independently. The present findings indicate that the iTex glove system has the potential for periodic and objective assessment of PD motor symptoms in remote settings.

Shaban, Mohamed	Deep Learning for Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis: A Short Survey	Computers	EN	Review	machine and deep learning; artificial neural networks; convolutional neural networks; Parkinson’s disease	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a serious movement disorder that may eventually progress to mild cognitive dysfunction (MCI) and dementia. According to the Parkinson’s foundation, one million Americans were diagnosed with PD and almost 10 million individuals suffer from the disease worldwide. An early and precise clinical diagnosis of PD will ensure an early initiation of effective therapeutic treatments, which will potentially slow down the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Machine and deep learning are promising technologies that may assist and support clinicians in providing an objective and reliable diagnosis of the disease based upon significant and unique features identified from relevant medical data. In this paper, the author provides a comprehensive review of the artificial intelligence techniques that were recently proposed during the period from 2016 to 2022 for the screening and staging of PD as well as the identification of the biomarkers of the disease based on Electroencephalography (EEG), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), speech tests, handwriting exams, and sensory data. In addition, the author highlights the current and future trends for PD diagnosis based machine and deep learning and discusses the limitations, challenges, potential future solutions, and recommendations for a reliable application of machine and deep learning for PD detection and screening.

Ringgit, Gilbert; Siddiquee, Shafiquzzaman; Saallah, Suryani; Mohamad Lal, Mohammad	Nanomaterial Sensing Advantages: Electrochemical Behavior, Optimization and Performance of f-MWCNTs/CS/PB/AuE towards Aluminum Ions (Al3+) in Drinking Water	Crystals	EN	Article	aluminum ions; functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes; chitosan; Prussian blue; drinking water	Modern technology has been evolving towards nanotechnology due to the materials that can be transformed and manipulated on micro and nanoscales. In terms of detection, nanomaterials offer substantial sensing advantages, particularly in terms of enhanced sensitivity, synergistic effect, stability and selectivity. The immobilization of nanoparticles could alter the physicochemical properties of the electrode’s surface depending on the type of materials synthesized and employed. This research examined the synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and chitosan (CS), as well as the immobilization of Prussian blue (PB) on the surface of a bare gold electrode (AuE). These materials have been reported to have strong electrical conductivity and nanomaterial compatibility. In contrast, aluminum has been described as a replacement for traditional water quality treatment processes, such as chlorination and ozonation. Aluminum concentrations must be monitored despite the use of chemical treatment for water quality. Hence, excessive levels of exposure frequently result in neurotoxic effects including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disorders. In this experiment, the optimal conditions for f-MWCNTs, CS, PB, and AuE for the detection of Al3+ are phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.1 M, pH 2) with 5 mM Prussian Blue; scan rate = 0.25 Vs−1; accumulation duration = 25 s; and volume = 10 mL (ratio of 4:6). The performance of f-MWCNTs, CS, PB, and AuE was measured between 0.2 and 1 ppm with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.9853 (y = 0.0387x + 0.0748). The limit of detection (LOD) of the modified electrode was determined to be 0.002 ppm, with a recovery of 98.66–99.56%. The application of nanoparticles resulted in various advantages, including high conductivity, a simple, less time-consuming preparation technique, and enhanced sensitivity and stability for detecting the lowest concentration of Al3+ in drinking water.

Gómez, Daniel	Untangling the Microscopic World of Organelles, Cells, Tissues, and Organs: A Focus on the Dysfunctional Golgi Apparatus in Disease Research	Biology and Life Sciences Forum	EN	Abstract	organelle structural biology; Golgi apparatus; neurodegenerative diseases; cancer; imaging technologies; cryogenic electron tomography; soft-X-ray tomography; optical coherence tomography; therapeutic targets; drug design	Emerging techniques in organelle structural biology have revolutionized our understanding of disease mechanisms and opened new possibilities for developing targeted therapies. In particular, dysfunctions of the Golgi apparatus (GA) have been implicated in a wide range of neurological disorders and cancer, making it a key area of focus in organelle structural biology. The GA plays a crucial role in regulating the transport and modification of proteins and lipids, and dysfunction of this organelle can lead to mislocation and accumulation of proteins and impaired glycosylation, resulting in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Inhibition of vesicular trafficking by α-synuclein may affect dopamine-producing neurons and neuromodulators, while fragmentation and defects within the GA can lead to apoptotic pathways during pathological mechanisms. Additionally, defects and fragmentation of the GA have been implicated in cancer progression, making it a key area of interest for cancer researchers. Advances in imaging technology, such as cryogenic electron tomography, soft-X-ray tomography (SXT), and multiplex correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), have enabled high-resolution visualization of the GA and its dysfunctions in neurological diseases and cancer. These techniques provide detailed insight into the structure and function of the GA and have the potential to inform new treatments for diseases associated with GA dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that molecular zippers hold the Golgi membrane together, providing further insight into the mechanisms underlying GA dysfunction in diseases such as Parkinson’s, NDDs, and cancer. Cryo-CLEM and nanobody-assisted tissue immunostaining for volumetric EM (NATIVE) techniques enable high-resolution visualization of the GA and its native environment, aiding in understanding its function in health and disease. In addition, novel techniques such as Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enable rapid, accurate, and high-resolution in vivo imaging of the mouse cortex, providing 3D visualization of cortical microarchitecture using a feature segmentation algorithm. OCT enables label-free, micron-scale 3D imaging of biological tissues’ fine structures with significant depth and a large field of view. A 3D CNS segmentation mask of brain neural networks in a living mouse can be visualized at micron-level resolution using OCT. Overall, the organelle structural biology field, specifically the study of the Golgi apparatus dysfunction in neurological disorders and cancer, has significant implications for developing new therapeutic targets, gene therapy, and drug design. With continued research and advancements in imaging technologies, we can expect to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms of GA dysfunction in neurological disorders and cancer, paving the way for innovative new treatments and therapies.

The complexity of the brain and the relationships between different brain regions can be better understood through the classification of individual cell populations based on their molecular markers and transcriptomic features. Analysis of these unique cell types can explain their involvement in the pathology of psychiatric disorders. Recent studies in both human and animal models have emphasized the importance of transcriptome analysis of neuronal cells in psychiatric disorders but also revealed critical roles for non-neuronal cells, such as oligodendrocytes and microglia. In this review, we update current findings on the brain transcriptome and explore molecular studies addressing transcriptomic alterations identified in human and animal models in depression and stress, neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease), schizophrenia, opioid use disorder, and alcohol and psychostimulant abuse. We also comment on potential future directions in single-cell and single-nucleus studies.

However, to increase the test’s predictive value, the instrumented Timed Up and Go (iTUG) test has been developed, incorporating different technological approaches. This systematic review aims to explore the evidence of the technological proposal for the segmentation and analysis of iTUG in elderlies with or without pathologies. A search was conducted in five major databases, following PRISMA guidelines. The review included 40 studies that met the eligibility criteria. The most used technology was inertial sensors (75% of the studies), with healthy elderlies (35%) and elderlies with Parkinson’s disease (32.5%) being the most analyzed participants. In total, 97.5% of the studies applied automatic segmentation using rule-based algorithms. The iTUG test offers an economical and accessible alternative to increase the predictive value of TUG, identifying different variables, and can be used in clinical, community, and home settings.

Nowadays, recommendations of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics strongly recommend applying next generation sequencing (NGS) as a first-line test in patients with these disorders. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is widely regarded as the current technology of choice for diagnosing monogenic ND. The introduction of NGS allows for rapid and inexpensive large-scale genomic analysis and has led to enormous progress in deciphering monogenic forms of various genetic diseases. The simultaneous analysis of several potentially mutated genes improves the diagnostic process, making it faster and more efficient. The main aim of this report is to discuss the impact and advantages of the implementation of WES into the clinical diagnosis and management of ND. Therefore, we have performed a retrospective evaluation of WES application in 209 cases referred to the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona for WES sequencing derived from neurologists or clinical geneticists. In addition, we have further discussed some important facts regarding classification criteria for pathogenicity of rare variants, variants of unknown significance, deleterious variants, different clinical phenotypes, or frequency of actionable secondary findings. Different studies have shown that WES implementation establish diagnostic rate around 32% in ND and the continuous molecular diagnosis is essential to solve the remaining cases.

Studies on the early stages of PD pathogenesis are challenging due to the lack of relevant models. The most promising ones are models based on dopaminergic neurons (DAns) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of patients with hereditary forms of PD. This work describes a highly efficient 2D protocol for obtaining DAns from iPSCs. The protocol is rather simple, comparable in efficiency with previously published protocols, and does not require viral vectors. The resulting neurons have a similar transcriptome profile to previously published data for neurons, and have a high level of maturity marker expression. The proportion of sensitive (SOX6+) DAns in the population calculated from the level of gene expression is higher than resistant (CALB+) DAns. Electrophysiological studies of the DAns confirmed their voltage sensitivity and showed that a mutation in the PARK8 gene is associated with enhanced store-operated calcium entry. The study of high-purity DAns differentiated from the iPSCs of patients with hereditary PD using this differentiation protocol will allow for investigators to combine various research methods, from patch clamp to omics technologies, and maximize information about cell function in normal and pathological conditions.

Disease-modifying treatments for AD and PD are still lacking, but symptomatic therapies are available, although limited by difficult administration and patients’ scarce compliance at later disease stages. Transbuccal Drug Delivery Systems (TDDSs) include chemical-physics biotechnologies and mechatronic approaches, allowing drug delivery via the transbuccal route, a strategy that may theoretically overcome the limitations imposed by conventional oral administration. In this review, we provided a snapshot of TDDSs, their mechanism of action, the existing subtypes, and their potential application in PD and AD patients. We found a variety of TDDSs, including tablets, solutions, sprays, patches, and the more sophisticated “mechatronic” IntelliDrug and OraFuse devices using a system of pumps and valves for continuous drug release. Several trials have been conducted either on models or patients to test the safety and efficacy of the antidementia and antiparkinsonian agents delivered by TDDSs, which produced encouraging results that suggest future application on a larger scale. Moreover, oral health has emerged as a fundamental prerequisite for the successful use of TDDSs. Accordingly, greater attention to oral hygiene is now due in patients with neurodegenerative disease.

Niazi, Sarfaraz	RNA Therapeutics: A Healthcare Paradigm Shift	Biomedicines	EN	Review	mRNA; ribonucleic acid (RNA); vaccines; PCR; autoimmune disorders; therapeutic proteins; repurposing drugs; affordable therapies	COVID-19 brought about the mRNA vaccine and a paradigm shift to a new mode of treating and preventing diseases. Synthetic RNA products are a low-cost solution based on a novel method of using nucleosides to act as an innate medicine factory with unlimited therapeutic possibilities. In addition to the common perception of vaccines preventing infections, the newer applications of RNA therapies include preventing autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Down syndrome; now, we can deliver monoclonal antibodies, hormones, cytokines, and other complex proteins, reducing the manufacturing hurdles associated with these products. Newer PCR technology removes the need for the bacterial expression of DNA, making mRNA a truly synthetic product. AI-driven product design expands the applications of mRNA technology to repurpose therapeutic proteins and test their safety and efficacy quickly. As the industry focuses on mRNA, many novel opportunities will arise, as hundreds of products under development will bring new perspectives based on this significant paradigm shift—finding newer solutions to existing challenges in healthcare.

Castro Aguiar, Rafael; Sam Jeeva Raj, Edward; Chakrabarty, Samit	Simplified Markerless Stride Detection Pipeline (sMaSDP) for Surface EMG Segmentation	Sensors	EN	Protocol	gait detection algorithms; EMG; IMU; segmentation; muscle activity	To diagnose mobility impairments and select appropriate physiotherapy, gait assessment studies are often recommended. These studies are usually conducted in confined clinical settings, which may feel foreign to a subject and affect their motivation, coordination, and overall mobility. Conducting gait studies in unconstrained natural settings instead, such as the subject’s Activities of Daily Life (ADL), could provide a more accurate assessment. To appropriately diagnose gait deficiencies, muscle activity should be recorded in parallel with typical kinematic studies. To achieve this, Electromyography (EMG) and kinematic are collected synchronously. Our protocol sMaSDP introduces a simplified markerless gait event detection pipeline for the segmentation of EMG signals via Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data, based on a publicly available dataset. This methodology intends to provide a simple, detailed sequence of processing steps for gait event detection via IMU and EMG, and serves as tutorial for beginners in unconstrained gait assessment studies. In an unconstrained gait experiment, 10 healthy subjects walk through a course designed to mimic everyday walking, with their kinematic and EMG data recorded, for a total of 20 trials. Five different walking modalities, such as level walking, ramp up/down, and staircase up/down are included. By segmenting and filtering the data, we generate an algorithm that detects heel-strike events, using a single IMU, and isolates EMG activity of gait cycles. Applicable to different datasets, sMaSDP was tested in healthy gait and gait data of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients. Using sMaSDP, we extracted muscle activity in healthy walking and identified heel-strike events in PD patient data. The algorithm parameters, such as expected velocity and cadence, are adjustable and can further improve the detection accuracy, and our emphasis on the wearable technologies makes this solution ideal for ADL gait studies.

Dimoudis, Dimitris; Tsolakis, Nikos; Magga-Nteve, Christoniki; Meditskos, Georgios; Vrochidis, Stefanos; Kompatsiaris, Ioannis	InSEption: A Robust Mechanism for Predicting FoG Episodes in PD Patients	Electronics	EN	Article	Parkinson’s disease; deep learning; freezing of gait; inception modules; wearable technology; squeeze and excitation module	The integration of IoT and deep learning provides the opportunity for continuous monitoring and evaluation of patients’ health status, leading to more personalized treatment and improved quality of life. This study explores the potential of deep learning to predict episodes of freezing of gait (FoG) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Initially, a literature review was conducted to determine the state of the art; then, two inception-based models, namely LN-Inception and InSEption, were introduced and tested using the Daphnet dataset and an additional novel medium-sized dataset collected from an IMU (inertial measuring unit) sensor. The results show that both models performed very well, outperforming or achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art. In particular, the InSEption network showed exceptional performance, achieving a 6% increase in macro F1 score compared to the inception-only-based counterpart on the Daphnet dataset. In a newly introduced IMU dataset, InSEption scored 97.2% and 98.6% in terms of F1 and AUC, respectively. This can be attributed to the added squeeze and excitation blocks and the domain-specific oversampling methods used for training. The benefits of using the Inception mechanism for signal data and its potential for integration into wearable IoT are validated.

Campo-Prieto, Pablo; Cancela-Carral, José; Rodríguez-Fuentes, Gustavo	Immersive Virtual Reality Reaction Time Test and Relationship with the Risk of Falling in Parkinson’s Disease	Sensors	EN	Article	virtual reality exposure therapy; digital health; Parkinson’s disease; reaction time; falls; videogames; physical activity; measurement of movement; rehabilitation; games for health	Immersive virtual reality (IVR) uses customized and advanced software and hardware to create a digital 3D reality in which all of the user’s senses are stimulated with computer-generated sensations and feedback. This technology is a promising tool that has already proven useful in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The risk of falls is very high in people with PD, and reaction times and processing speed may be markers of postural instability and functionality, cognitive impairment and disease progression. An exploratory study was conducted to explore the feasibility of reaction time tests performed in IVR as predictors of falls. A total of 26 volunteers (79.2% male; 69.73 ± 6.32 years) diagnosed with PD (1.54 ± 0.90 H&Y stage; 26.92 ± 2.64 MMSE) took part in the study. IVR intervention was feasible, with no adverse effects (no Simulator Sickness Questionnaire symptoms). IVR reaction times were related (Spearman’s rho) to functionality (timed up and go test (TUG) (rho = 0.537, p = 0.005); TUG-Cognitive (rho = 0.576, p = 0.020); cognitive impairment mini mental state exam (MMSE) (rho = −0.576, p = 0.002)) and the years of the patients (rho = 0.399, p = 0.043) but not with the first PD symptom or disease stage. IVR test is a complementary assessment tool that may contribute to preventing falls in the proposed sample. Additionally, based on the relationship between TUG and reaction times, a cut-off time is suggested that would be effective at predicting the risk of suffering a fall in PD patients using a simple and quick IVR test.

This therapy entails the transfer of genetic material into a patient’s cells to treat diseases. In particular, gene therapy for neurological diseases has recently achieved significant progress, with numerous studies investigating the use of adeno-associated viruses for the targeted delivery of therapeutic genetic fragments. This approach has potential applications for treating incurable diseases, including paralysis and motor impairment caused by spinal cord injury and Parkinson’s disease, and it is characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration. Recently, several studies have explored the potential of direct lineage reprogramming (DLR) for treating incurable diseases, and highlighted the advantages of DLR over conventional stem cell therapy. However, application of DLR technology in clinical practice is hindered by its low efficiency compared with cell therapy using stem cell differentiation. To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored various strategies such as the efficiency of DLR. In this study, we focused on innovative strategies, including the use of a nanoporous particle-based gene delivery system to improve the reprogramming efficiency of DLR-induced neurons. We believe that discussing these approaches can facilitate the development of more effective gene therapies for neurological disorders.

Sensors	EN	Article	digital technologies; codesign; digital care; Parkinson’s disease	The healthcare model is shifting towards integrated care approaches. This new model requires patients to be more closely involved. The iCARE-PD project aims to address this need by developing a technology-enabled, home-based, and community-centered integrated care paradigm. A central part of this project is the codesign process of the model of care, exemplified by the active participation of patients in the design and iterative evaluation of three sensor-based technological solutions. We proposed a codesign methodology used for testing the usability and acceptability of these digital technologies and present initial results for one of them, MooVeo. Our results show the usefulness of this approach in testing the usability and acceptability as well as the opportunity to incorporate patients’ feedback into the development. This initiative will hopefully help other groups incorporate a similar codesign approach and develop tools that are well adapted to patients’ and care teams’ needs.

Shichkina, Yulia; Fatkieva, Roza; Isaenko, Nikita	Monitoring the Condition of a Patient with Parkinson’s Disease	Engineering Proceedings	EN	Proceeding Paper	Parkinson’s disease; monitoring; IoT; styling; insert	Currently, interest in the development of Internet-of-Things technologies is increasingly penetrating the field of clinical medicine. This paper provides an overview of the use of Internet-of-Things technologies in medical practice using the Scopus database of publications. The classification of publications on the topic of research directions with promising development trends has been performed. With this in mind, the concept of the architecture of a system for monitoring the condition of a patient with Parkinson’s disease is presented. The necessary hardware and software solutions have been developed, taking into account the needs in order to more effectively adjust treatment and monitor the course of the disease. To more accurately determine the state of progression of the patient’s disease, tests have been designed and developed to assess overall emotional and physical well-being. For the most effective correction and control of drug therapy, a prototype of a drug administration device with four compartments for a drug has been designed, each compartment of which is individually controlled by a specially developed Bluetooth data transmission protocol. Access to each compartment is individual, which ensures the versatility of the device for taking several medications throughout the day. The practical application of the solution has also shown the relevance of its use in the task of studying the course of Parkinson’s disease as well as for monitoring the condition of a patient with existing concomitant diseases and the degree of their influence on the course of the underlying disease.

Rinaldi, Chiara; Landre, Cleuton; Volpe, Maria; Gonçalves, Rebeca; Nunes, Lucas; Darienso, Danyela; Cruz, Ana; Oliveira, João; Rinaldi, Salvatore; Fontani, Vania; Barcessat, Ana	Improving Functional Capacity and Quality of Life in Parkinson’s Disease Patients through REAC Neuromodulation Treatments for Mood and Behavioral Disorders	Journal of Personalized Medicine	EN	Article	Parkinson; motor symptoms; non-motor symptoms; mood and behavioral disorders; neuromodulation; radio electric asymmetric conveyer technology	Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder that affects both motor and non-motor functions, including depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. Currently, it remains a challenge to distinguish the correlation between these aspects and their impact on one another. To try to clarify these reciprocal influences, in this study we have used specific radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments for behavioral mood disorders and adjustment disorders. In particular, we employed the neuro-postural optimization (NPO) and neuro-psycho-physical optimization (NPPOs) treatments. The study enrolled randomly 50 subjects of both genders previously diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease for at least six months. Prior to and following REAC NPO and NPPOs treatments, we assessed the subjects using functional dysmetria (FD) evaluation, five times sit to stand test (FTSST) for postural stability, and the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) for quality of life (QLF) evaluation. The positive results produced by the REAC NPO and NPPOs neuromodulation treatments, specific for mood and adaptation disorders, on dysfunctional motor disorders, and quality of life confirm how the non-motor components can condition the symptomatology of Parkinsonian motor symptoms. These results also highlight the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPOs treatments in improving the overall quality of life of these patients.

In this study, Hdac6−/− mice were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology for exploring the effect of HDAC6 on the pathological progression of PD. We found that male Hdac6−/− mice exhibit hyperactivity and certain anxiety. In the acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice, though motor injury was slightly alleviated by HDAC6 deficiency, dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum, the decrease in the number of DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the reduction in DA neuronal terminals were not affected. In addition, activation of glial cells and the expression of α-synuclein, as well as the levels of apoptosis-related proteins in the nigrostriatal pathway, were not changed in MPTP-injected wild-type and Hdac6−/− mice. Therefore, HDAC6 deficiency leads to moderate alterations of behaviors and Parkinson’s disease pathology in mice.

Cabrera Ranaldi, Erika; Nuytemans, Karen; Martinez, Anisley; Luca, Corneliu; Keane, Robert; de Rivero Vaccari, Juan	Proof-of-Principle Study of Inflammasome Signaling Proteins as Diagnostic Biomarkers of the Inflammatory Response in Parkinson’s Disease	Pharmaceuticals	EN	Article	inflammasome; biomarkers; caspase-1; ASC; Parkinson’s disease	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, the accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates, and motor deficits. A major contributor to dopaminergic neuronal loss is neuroinflammation. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that perpetuates neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders including PD. Increases in inflammasome proteins are associated with worsened pathology. Thus, the inhibition of inflammatory mediators has the potential to aid in PD treatment. Here, we investigated inflammasome signaling proteins as potential biomarkers of the inflammatory response in PD. Plasma from PD subjects and healthy age-matched controls were evaluated for levels of the inflammasome protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), caspase-1, and interleukin (IL)-18. This was carried out using Simple Plex technology to identify changes in inflammasome proteins in the blood of PD subjects. The area under the curve (AUC) was obtained through calculation of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to obtain information on biomarker reliability and traits. Additionally, we completed a stepwise regression selected from the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) to assess how the inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and ASC contribute to IL-18 levels in people with PD. PD subjects demonstrated elevated caspase-1, ASC, and IL-18 levels when compared to controls; each of these proteins were found to be promising biomarkers of inflammation in PD. Furthermore, inflammasome proteins were determined to significantly contribute to and predict IL-18 levels in subjects with PD. Thus, we demonstrated that inflammasome proteins serve as reliable biomarkers of inflammation in PD and that inflammasome proteins provide significant contributions to IL-18 levels in PD.

Limited epidural space requires resistant biocompatible microelectrodes to deliver efficiently electrical currents through a metal–cellular interface. Platinum (Pt) microelectrodes may lead to material degradation and topography modification under prolonged electrical stimulation. Thus, microstimulation performance over time can deteriorate and affect the functional recovery produced by SCS. To investigate electrodes commonly implanted in the epidural space of rats, Pt microelectrodes immersed in physiological saline underwent 48 h of electrical stimulation (100 Hz; 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 mA). A wettability test was performed to characterize the interaction of the contact angle before and after stimulation, and it was found that there was an increase in this angle after the stimulation. An electrical impedance test showed that electrochemical interactions caused an increase in impedance after the stimulation. A roughness analysis also showed an increase in roughness after stimulation. Pt electrodes under chronic electric stimulation are susceptible to degradation, and further studies can improve electrode stability and efficacy as new sensor technologies become available.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) are two widely used neuroimaging techniques to review changes in brain activity. fMRI is a noninvasive technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed brain images. An EEG is a noninvasive technique that records the brain’s electrical activity through electrodes placed on the scalp. This review overviews recent developments in noninvasive functional neuroimaging methods, including fMRI and EEG. Recent advances in fMRI technology, its application to studying brain function, and the impact of neuroimaging techniques on neuroscience research are discussed. Advances in EEG technology and its applications to analyzing brain function and neural oscillations are also highlighted. In addition, advanced courses in neuroimaging, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), are described, along with their role in studying brain connectivity, white matter tracts, and potential treatments for schizophrenia and chronic pain. Application. The review concludes by examining neuroimaging studies of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). We also described the role of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in ASD, ADHD, AD, and PD. Neuroimaging techniques have significantly advanced our understanding of brain function and provided essential insights into neurological disorders. However, further research into noninvasive treatments such as EEG, MRI, and TES is necessary to continue to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders.

The novel organometallic reactions, developed by the authors, of Ti-catalyzed cross-cyclomagnesiation of O-containing and aliphatic allenes using available Grignard reagents were applied at the key stage of synthesis. We have studied the biological activity of the synthesized individual chatenaytrienins-1, -2, -3 and -4 in vitro, including their cytotoxicity in a panel of tumor lines and their ability to induce apoptosis, affect the cell cycle and mitochondria, and activate the main apoptotic signaling pathways in the cell, applying modern approaches of flow cytometry and multiplex analysis with Luminex xMAP technology. It has been shown that chatenaytrienins affect mitochondria by uncoupling the processes of mitochondrial respiration, causing the accumulation of ROS ions, followed by the initiation of apoptosis. The most likely mechanism for the death of cortical neurons from the consumption of tea from the seeds of Annona fruit is long-term chronic hypoxia, which leads to the development of an atypical form of Parkinson’s disease that is characteristic of the indigenous inhabitants of Guam and New Caledonia.

These motor symptoms are mainly evaluated by clinicians via direct observations of patients and, as such, can potentially be influenced by personal biases and inter- and intra-rater differences. In order to provide more objective assessments, researchers have been developing technology-based systems aimed at objective measurements of motor symptoms, among which are the reduced and/or trembling swings of the lower limbs during gait tests, resulting in data that are potentially prone to more objective evaluations. Within this frame, although the swings of the upper limbs during walking are likewise important, no efforts have been made to reveal their support significance. To fill this lack, this work concerns a technology-based assessment of the forearm-swing capabilities of PD patients with respect to their healthy counterparts. This was obtained by adopting a viscoelastic model validated via measurements during gait tests tackled as an inverse dynamic problem aimed at determining the torque forces acting on the forearms. The obtained results evidence differences in the forearm movements during gait tests of healthy subjects and PD patients with different pathology levels, and, in particular, we evidenced how the worsening of the disease can cause the worsening of the mechanical support offered by the forearm’s swing to the walking process.

Unlike whole-cell automated patch-clamp (APC), lysosomal patch-clamp (LPC) facilitates physiological conditions, but is not yet suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS) applications. Here, we apply solid supported membrane-based electrophysiology (SSME), which enables both direct access to lysosomes and high-throughput electrophysiological recordings. In SSME, ion translocation mediated by TMEM175 is stimulated using a concentration gradient at a resting potential of 0 mV. The concentration-dependent K+ response exhibited an I/c curve with two distinct slopes, indicating the existence of two conducting states. We measured H+ fluxes with a permeability ratio of PH/PK = 48,500, which matches literature findings from patch-clamp studies, validating the SSME approach. Additionally, TMEM175 displayed a high pH dependence. Decreasing cytosolic pH inhibited both K+ and H+ conductivity of TMEM175. Conversely, lysosomal pH and pH gradients did not have major effects on TMEM175. Finally, we developed HTS assays for drug screening and evaluated tool compounds (4-AP, Zn as inhibitors; DCPIB, arachidonic acid, SC-79 as enhancers) using SSME and APC. Additionally, we recorded EC50 data for eight blinded TMEM175 enhancers and compared the results across all three assay technologies, including LPC, discussing their advantages and disadvantages.

Despite the nature of glaucoma as a neurodegenerative disorder with several similarities with the other above-mentioned diseases, transcriptional data about this disease are still scarce. microRNAs are small molecules (~17–25 nucleotides) that have been found to be specifically expressed in the CNS as major components of the system regulating the development signatures of neurodegenerative diseases and the homeostasis of the brain. In this review, we sought to identify similarities between the functional mechanisms and the activated pathways of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to discuss how those mechanisms are regulated by miRNAs, using RNA-Seq as an approach to compare them.

Aggregations of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) are associated with the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. Recently, the interaction between UBL3 and α-syn was discovered, with potential implications in clearing excess α-syn from neurons and its role in disease spread. However, the regulator that can mediate the interaction between UBL3 and α-syn remains unclear. In this study, using the split gaussian luciferase complementation assay and RNA interference technology, we identified that QSOX2, HTATIP2, UBE3C, MGST3, NSF, HECTD1, SAE1, and ATG3 were involved in downregulating the interaction between UBL3 and α-syn. Notably, silencing MGST3 had the most significant impact. Immunocytochemistry staining confirmed the impact of MGST3 silencing on the co-localization of UBL3 and α-syn in cells. MGST3 is a part of the antioxidant system, and silencing MGST3 is believed to contribute to oxidative stress. We induced oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide, observing its effect on the UBL3-α-syn interaction, and showing that 800 µM of H2O2 downregulated this interaction. In conclusion, silencing MGST3 downregulates the interaction between UBL3 and α-syn.

Through the establishment of comprehensive biobanks, researchers can collect and store various biological specimens, including urine, blood, tissue, and DNA samples, to study these mechanisms. In the context of neuro-urology, biobanking facilitates the identification of genetic variations, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression patterns associated with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. These conditions often present as symptoms of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, and many others. Biobanking of tissue specimens from such patients is essential to understand why these diseases cause the respective symptoms and what can be done to alleviate them. The utilization of high-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and gene expression profiling, enables researchers to explore the molecular landscape of these conditions in an unprecedented manner. The development of specific and reliable biomarkers resulting from these efforts may help in early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective monitoring of neuro-urological conditions, leading to improved patient care and management. Furthermore, these biomarkers could potentially facilitate the monitoring of novel therapies currently under investigation in neuro-urological clinical trials. This comprehensive review explores the synergistic integration of neuro-urology and biobanking, with particular emphasis on the translation of biobanking approaches in molecular research in neuro-urology. We discuss the advantages of biobanking in neuro-urological studies, the types of specimens collected and their applications in translational research. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of standardization and quality assurance when collecting samples and discuss challenges that may compromise sample quality and impose limitations on their subsequent utilization. Finally, we give recommendations for sampling in multicenter studies, examine sustainability issues associated with biobanking, and provide future directions for this dynamic field.

The unavailability of quality data due to both the difficulty to gather and label them as well as due to their sensitive nature create a breeding ground for data augmentation solutions. Parkinson’s Disease (PD) which can have a wide range of symptoms including motor impairments consists of a very challenging case for quality data acquisition. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can help alleviate such data availability issues. In this light, this study focuses on a data augmentation solution engaging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using a freezing of gait (FoG) symptom dataset as input. The data generated by the so-called FoGGAN architecture presented in this study are almost identical to the original as concluded by a variety of similarity metrics. This highlights the significance of such solutions as they can provide credible synthetically generated data which can be utilized as training dataset inputs to AI applications. Additionally, a DNN classifier’s performance is evaluated using three different evaluation datasets and the accuracy results were quite encouraging, highlighting that the FOGGAN solution could lead to the alleviation of the data shortage matter.

A Systematic Review	Brain Sciences	EN	Systematic Review	biomarkers; connectivity; functional brain imaging; iron; neurodegenerative disorders; neuroimaging; neuromelanin; Parkinson’s disease; REM sleep behavior disorder; ultra-high field MRI	The increasing number of MRI studies focused on prodromal Parkinson’s Disease (PD) demonstrates a strong interest in identifying early biomarkers capable of monitoring neurodegeneration. In this systematic review, we present the latest information regarding the most promising MRI markers of neurodegeneration in relation to the most specific prodromal symptoms of PD, namely isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). We reviewed structural, diffusion, functional, iron-sensitive, neuro-melanin-sensitive MRI, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies conducted between 2000 and 2023, which yielded a total of 77 relevant papers. Among these markers, iron and neuromelanin emerged as the most robust and promising indicators for early neurodegenerative processes in iRBD. Atrophy was observed in several regions, including the frontal and temporal cortices, limbic cortices, and basal ganglia, suggesting that neurodegenerative processes had been underway for some time. Diffusion and functional MRI produced heterogeneous yet intriguing results. Additionally, reduced glymphatic clearance function was reported. Technological advancements, such as the development of ultra-high field MRI, have enabled the exploration of minute anatomical structures and the detection of previously undetectable anomalies. The race to achieve early detection of neurodegeneration is well underway.

We aimed to identify blood immunity-associated proteins that discriminate PD from controls and that are associated with long-term disease severity in PD patients. Immune response-derived proteins in blood plasma were measured using Proximity Extension Technology by OLINK in a cohort of PD patients (N = 66) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 52). In a selection of 30 PD patients, we evaluated changes in protein levels 7–10 years after the baseline and assessed correlations with motor and cognitive assessments. Data from the Parkinson’s Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP) cohort and the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort were used for independent validation. PD patients showed an altered immune response compared to controls based on a panel of four proteins (IL-12B, OPG, CXCL11, and CSF-1). The expression levels of five inflammation-associated proteins (CCL23, CCL25, TNFRSF9, TGF-alpha, and VEGFA) increased over time in PD and were partially associated with more severe motor and cognitive symptoms at follow-up. Increased CCL23 levels were associated with cognitive decline and the APOE4 genotype. Our findings provide further evidence for an altered immune response in PD that is associated with disease severity in PD over a long period of time.

Shen, Xuechen; Ariga, Katsuhiko	Disease Diagnosis with Chemosensing, Artificial Intelligence, and Prospective Contributions of Nanoarchitectonics	Chemosensors	EN	Perspective	artificial intelligence; noninvasive disease diagnosis; chemosensing; cancer; Parkinson’s disease; nanoarchitectonics	In modern materials research, nanotechnology will play a game-changing role, with nanoarchitectonics as an overarching integrator of the field and artificial intelligence hastening its progress as a super-accelerator. We would like to discuss how this schema can be utilized in the context of specific applications, with exemplification using disease diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on early, noninvasive disease diagnosis as a target application. In particular, recent trends in chemosensing in the detection of cancer and Parkinson’s disease are reviewed. The concept has been gaining traction as dynamic volatile metabolite profiles have been increasingly associated with disease onset, making them promising diagnostic tools in early stages of disease. We also discuss advances in nanoarchitectonic chemosensors, which are theoretically ideal form factors for diagnostic chemosensing devices. Last but not least, we shine the spotlight on the rise to prominence and emergent contributions of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent works, which have elucidated a strong synergy between chemosensing and AI. The powerful combination of nanoarchitectonic chemosensors and AI could challenge our current notions of disease diagnosis. Disease diagnosis and detection of emerging viruses are important challenges facing society. The parallel development of advanced functional materials for sensing is necessary to support and enable AI methodologies in making technological leaps in applications. The material and structural formative technologies of nanoarchitectonics are critical in meeting these challenges.

Pires, Patrícia; Paiva-Santos, Ana; Veiga, Francisco	Liposome-Derived Nanosystems for the Treatment of Behavioral and Neurodegenerative Diseases: The Promise of Niosomes, Transfersomes, and Ethosomes for Increased Brain Drug Bioavailability	Pharmaceuticals	EN	Review	Alzheimer’s disease; anxiety; brain bioavailability; depression; ethosomes; intranasal; niosomes; Parkinson’s; schizophrenia; transfersomes	Psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders are amongst the most prevalent and debilitating diseases, but current treatments either have low success rates, greatly due to the low permeability of the blood–brain barrier, and/or are connected to severe side effects. Hence, new strategies are extremely important, and here is where liposome-derived nanosystems come in. Niosomes, transfersomes, and ethosomes are nanometric vesicular structures that allow drug encapsulation, protecting them from degradation, and increasing their solubility, permeability, brain targeting, and bioavailability. This review highlighted the great potential of these nanosystems for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety, and depression. Studies regarding the encapsulation of synthetic and natural-derived molecules in these systems, for intravenous, oral, transdermal, or intranasal administration, have led to an increased brain bioavailability when compared to conventional pharmaceutical forms. Moreover, the developed formulations proved to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, including brain neurotransmitter level restoration and brain oxidative status improvement, and improved locomotor activity or enhancement of recognition and working memories in animal models. Hence, albeit being relatively new technologies, niosomes, transfersomes, and ethosomes have already proven to increase the brain bioavailability of psychoactive drugs, leading to increased effectiveness and decreased side effects, showing promise as future therapeutics.

Vetchinova, Anna; Kapkaeva, Marina; Ivanov, Mikhail; Kutukova, Kristina; Mudzhiri, Natalia; Frumkina, Lydia; Brydun, Anatoly; Sukhorukov, Vladimir; Illarioshkin, Sergey	Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Dopaminergic Neurons Derived from Patients with LRRK2- and SNCA-Associated Genetic Forms of Parkinson’s Disease	Current Issues in Molecular Biology	EN	Article	Parkinson’s disease; LRRK2; SCNA; alpha-synuclein; dardarin; induced pluripotent stem cells; dopaminergic neurons; transcriptomics; mitochondria	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Some cases of PD may be caused by genetic factors, among which mutations in the LRRK2 and SNCA genes play an important role. To develop effective neuroprotective strategies for PD, it is important to diagnose the disease at the earliest stages of the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, the detection of diagnostic and prognostic markers of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an urgent medical need. Advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture technology provide new opportunities for the search for new biomarkers of PD and its modeling in vitro. In our work, we used a new technology for multiplex profiling of gene expression using barcoding on the Nanostring platform to assess the activity of mitochondrial genes on iPSC-derived cultures of dopaminergic neurons obtained from patients with LRRK2- and SNCA-associated genetic forms PD and a healthy donor. Electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural changes in mitochondria in both LRRK2 and SNCA mutant cells, whereas mitochondria in cells from a healthy donor were normal. In a culture with the SNCA gene mutation, the ratio of the area occupied by mitochondria to the total area of the cytoplasm was significantly lower than in the control and in the line with the LRRK2 gene mutation. Transcriptome analysis of 105 mitochondria proteome genes using the Nanostring platform revealed differences between the diseased and normal cells in the activity of genes involved in respiratory complex function, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP production, mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum interaction, mitophagy, regulation of calcium concentration, and mitochondrial DNA replication.

LaMarca, Amber; Tse, Ivy; Keysor, Julie	Rehabilitation Technologies for Chronic Conditions: Will We Sink or Swim?	Healthcare	EN	Review	rehabilitation technology; exoskeletons; virtual reality; augmentative reality; mHealth; remote monitoring	Introduction: Chronic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, vestibular disorders, chronic pain, arthritis, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart disease are leading causes of disability among middle-aged and older adults. While evidence-based treatment can optimize clinical outcomes, few people with chronic conditions engage in the recommended levels of exercise for clinical improvement and successful management of their condition. Rehabilitation technologies that can augment therapeutic care—i.e., exoskeletons, virtual/augmented reality, and remote monitoring—offer the opportunity to bring evidence-based rehabilitation into homes. Successful integration of rehabilitation techniques at home could help recovery and access and foster long term self-management. However, widespread uptake of technology in rehabilitation is still limited, leaving many technologies developed but not adopted. Methods: In this narrative review, clinical need, efficacy, and obstacles and suggestions for implementation are discussed. The use of three technologies is reviewed in the management of the most prevalent chronic diseases that utilize rehabilitation services, including common neurological, musculoskeletal, metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions. The technologies are (i) exoskeletons, (ii) virtual and augmented reality, and (iii) remote monitoring. Results: Effectiveness evidence backing the use of technology in rehabilitation is growing but remains limited by high heterogeneity, lack of long-term outcomes, and lack of adoption outcomes. Conclusion: While rehabilitation technologies bring opportunities to bridge the gap between clinics and homes, there are many challenges with adoption. Hybrid effectiveness and implementation trials are a possible path to successful technology development and adoption.

Nonetheless, no study to date has investigated the minimum number of days required to reliably estimate the average daily steps through commercial smartwatches in people with PD. Fifty-six patients were monitored through a commercial smartwatch for 5 consecutive days. The total daily steps for each day was recorded and the average daily steps was calculated as well as the working and weekend days average steps. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (3,k), standard error of measurement (SEM), Bland–Altman statistics, and minimum detectable change (MDC) were used to evaluate the reliability of the step count for every combination of 2–5 days. The threshold for acceptability was set at an ICC ≥ 0.8 with a lower bound of CI 95% ≥ 0.75 and a SAM < 10%. ANOVA and Mann–Whitney tests were used to compare steps across the days and between the working and weekend days, respectively. Four days were needed to achieve an acceptable reliability (ICC range: 0.84–0.90; SAM range: 7.8–9.4%). In addition, daily steps did not significantly differ across the days and between the working and weekend days. These findings could support the use of step count as a walking activity index and could be relevant to developing monitoring, preventive, and rehabilitation strategies for people with PD.

Fajardo, Jair; Melo, Leonimer	Towards a Modular Pathological Tremor Simulation System Based on the Stewart Platform	Sensors	EN	Article	tremor simulation; Parkinson’s disease; multibody dynamics; wearable devices; assistive technologies; systems modeling; Kalman filter; sensor fusion	Wearable technologies have aided in reducing pathological tremor symptoms through non-intrusive solutions that aim to identify patterns in involuntary movements and suppress them using actuators positioned at specific joints. However, during the development of these devices, tests were primarily conducted on patients due to the difficulty of faithfully simulating tremors using simulation equipment. Based on studies characterizing tremors in Parkinson’s disease, the development of a robotic manipulator based on the Stewart platform was initiated, with the goal of satisfactorily simulating resting tremor movements in the hands. In this work, a simulator was implemented in a computational environment using the multibody dynamics method. The platform structure was designed in a virtual environment using SOLIDWORKS® v2017 software and later exported to Matlab® R17a software using the Simulink environment and Simscape multibody library. The workspace was evaluated, and the Kalman filter was used to merge acceleration and angular velocity data and convert them into data related to the inclination and rotation of real patients’ wrists, which were subsequently executed in the simulator. The results show a high correlation and low dispersion between real and simulated signals, demonstrating that the simulated mechanism has the capacity to represent Parkinson’s disease resting tremors in all wrist movements. The system could contribute to conducting tremor tests in suppression devices without the need for the presence of the patient and aid in comparing suppression techniques, benefiting the development of new wearable devices.

A pivotal aspect in addressing these challenges lies in the elucidation and application of biomarkers for timely diagnosis, vigilant monitoring, and effective treatment modalities. This review delineates the quintessence of biomarkers in the realm of NDs, elucidating various classifications and their indispensable roles. Particularly, the quest for novel biomarkers in AD, transcending traditional markers in PD, and the frontier of biomarker research in ALS are scrutinized. Emergent susceptibility and trait markers herald a new era of personalized medicine, promising enhanced treatment initiation especially in cases of SOD1-ALS. The discourse extends to diagnostic and state markers, revolutionizing early detection and monitoring, alongside progression markers that unveil the trajectory of NDs, propelling forward the potential for tailored interventions. The synergy between burgeoning technologies and innovative techniques like -omics, histologic assessments, and imaging is spotlighted, underscoring their pivotal roles in biomarker discovery. Reflecting on the progress hitherto, the review underscores the exigent need for multidisciplinary collaborations to surmount the challenges ahead, accelerate biomarker discovery, and herald a new epoch of understanding and managing NDs. Through a panoramic lens, this article endeavors to provide a comprehensive insight into the burgeoning field of biomarkers in NDs, spotlighting the promise they hold in transforming the diagnostic landscape, enhancing disease management, and illuminating the pathway toward efficacious therapeutic interventions.

Clinically Informed Automated Assessment of Finger Tapping Videos in Parkinson’s Disease	Sensors	EN	Article	Parkinson’s disease; finger tapping; UDPRS quantification; data-driven; machine learning	The utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for assessing motor performance in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) offers substantial potential, particularly if the results can be integrated into clinical decision-making processes. However, the precise quantification of PD symptoms remains a persistent challenge. The current standard Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and its variations serve as the primary clinical tools for evaluating motor symptoms in PD, but are time-intensive and prone to inter-rater variability. Recent work has applied data-driven machine learning techniques to analyze videos of PD patients performing motor tasks, such as finger tapping, a UPDRS task to assess bradykinesia. However, these methods often use abstract features that are not closely related to clinical experience. In this paper, we introduce a customized machine learning approach for the automated scoring of UPDRS bradykinesia using single-view RGB videos of finger tapping, based on the extraction of detailed features that rigorously conform to the established UPDRS guidelines. We applied the method to 75 videos from 50 PD patients collected in both a laboratory and a realistic clinic environment. The classification performance agreed well with expert assessors, and the features selected by the Decision Tree aligned with clinical knowledge. Our proposed framework was designed to remain relevant amid ongoing patient recruitment and technological progress. The proposed approach incorporates features that closely resonate with clinical reasoning and shows promise for clinical implementation in the foreseeable future.

We used OpenArray technology to assess gene expression in the substantia nigra (SN) cells of mice in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD and in controls. Among the 11 housekeeping genes tested, Rps27a was taken as the reference gene due to its most stable expression in normal and experimental conditions. From 101 genes encoding functionally significant proteins of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, 57 highly expressed genes were selected to assess their expressions in the PD model and in the controls. The expressions of Th, Ddc, Maoa, Comt, Slc6a3, Slc18a2, Drd2, and Nr4a2 decreased in the experiment compared to the control, indicating decreases in the synthesis, degradation, and transport of dopamine and the impaired autoregulation of dopaminergic neurons. The expressions of Tubb3, Map2, Syn1, Syt1, Rab7, Sod1, Cib1, Gpx1, Psmd4, Ubb, Usp47, and Ctsb genes were also decreased in the MPTP-treated mice, indicating impairments of axonal and vesicular transport and abnormal functioning of the antioxidant and ubiquitin-proteasome systems in the SN. The detected decreases in the expressions of Snca, Nsf, Dnm1l, and Keap1 may serve to reduce pathological protein aggregation, increase dopamine release in the striatum, prevent mitophagy, and restore the redox status of SN cells.

The success of these pursuits, however, relies on the use of cells most relevant to those targeted by the disease of interest, for example, midbrain dopaminergic neurons for Parkinson’s disease. In the present study, we report the generation of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line capable of purifying and tracing nascent midbrain dopaminergic progenitors and their differentiated progeny via the expression of a Blue Fluorescent Protein (BFP). This was achieved by CRISPR/Cas9-assisted knock-in of BFP and Cre into the safe harbour locus AAVS1 and an early midbrain dopaminergic lineage marker gene LMX1A, respectively. Immunocytochemical analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing of iPSC-derived neural cultures confirm developmental recapitulation of the human fetal midbrain and high-quality midbrain cells. By modelling Parkinson’s disease-related drug toxicity using 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), we showed a preferential reduction of BFP+ cells, a finding demonstrated independently by cell death assays and single-cell transcriptomic analysis of MPP+ treated neural cultures. Together, these results highlight the importance of disease-relevant cell types in stem cell modelling.

This review aims to synthesize and analyze the evidence on the impact of physiotherapy intervention through TR on QoL in patients with stroke, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), together with an evaluation of their satisfaction and technology acceptance levels. Through a systematic search of the literature and a screening process, treatment effects were assessed with meta-analyses using the standardized mean difference, setting the confidence interval at 95%. We included 28 studies in the review, which were analyzed for methodological quality, whereas 16 studies were included in the meta-analyses. The results suggest a significant improvement in QoL in patients who underwent TR. We were unable to perform analyses for satisfaction and technology acceptance outcomes due to insufficient data. Overall, motor TR has a positive impact on the QoL of patients with neurological diseases, especially in stroke patients; although caution is needed in the interpretation of the results due to the high heterogeneity found. For PD and MS, TR seems to yield comparable results to in-person treatment.

Mishima, Takayasu; Yuasa-Kawada, Junichi; Fujioka, Shinsuke; Tsuboi, Yoshio	Perry Disease: Bench to Bedside Circulation and a Team Approach	Biomedicines	EN	Opinion	Perry syndrome; rare disease; genetic testing; pathogenesis; common disease; research; treatment; bedside; technological applications; team	With technological applications, especially in genetic testing, new diseases have been discovered and new disease concepts have been proposed in recent years; however, the pathogenesis and treatment of these rare diseases are not as well established as those of common diseases. To demonstrate the importance of rare disease research, in this paper we focus on our research topic, Perry disease (Perry syndrome). Perry disease is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by parkinsonism, depression/apathy, weight loss, and respiratory symptoms including central hypoventilation and central sleep apnea. The pathological classification of Perry disease falls under TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathies. Patients with Perry disease exhibit DCTN1 mutations, which is the causative gene for the disease; they also show relatively uniform pathological and clinical features. This review summarizes recent findings regarding Perry disease from both basic and clinical perspectives. In addition, we describe technological innovations and outline future challenges and treatment prospects. We discuss the expansion of research from rare diseases to common diseases and the importance of collaboration between clinicians and researchers. Here, we highlight the importance of researching rare diseases as it contributes to a deeper understanding of more common diseases, thereby opening up new avenues for scientific exploration.

In this study, we conducted a transcriptome analysis utilizing post mortem mRNA extracted from the substantia nigra of both PD patients and healthy control (CTRL) individuals. Specifically, we acquired eight samples from individuals with PD and six samples from CTRL individuals, with no discernible pathology detected in the latter group. RNA sequencing was conducted using the TapeStation 4200 system from Agilent Technologies. A total of 16,148 transcripts were identified, with 92 mRNAs displaying differential expression between the PD and control groups. Specifically, 33 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated, while 59 mRNAs were down-regulated in PD compared to the controls. The identification of statistically significant signaling pathways, with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05, unveiled noteworthy insights. Specifically, the enriched categories included cardiac muscle contraction (involving genes such as ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit beta 2 (ATP1B2), solute carrier family 8 member A1 (SLC8A1), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2)), GABAergic synapse (involving GABA type A receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAPL1), G protein subunit beta 5 (GNB5), and solute carrier family 38 member 2 (SLC38A2), autophagy (involving GABARAPL1 and tumor protein p53-inducible nuclear protein 2 (TP53INP2)), and Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) mediated phagocytosis (involving amphiphysin (AMPH)). These findings uncover new pathophysiological dimensions underlying PD, implicating genes associated with heart muscle contraction. This knowledge enhances diagnostic accuracy and contributes to the advancement of targeted therapies.	Oasi Research Institute–IRCCS, 94018 Troin, Italy	10.3390/ijms25020707	2024	25	2	-	-	707	-

This review explores the applications and innovations of SERS in understanding the pathophysiological basis and diagnosis of brain disorders. SERS holds significant advantages over conventional Raman spectroscopy, particularly in terms of sensitivity and stability. The integration of label-free SERS presents promising opportunities for the rapid, reliable, and non-invasive diagnosis of brain-associated diseases, particularly when combined with advanced computational methods such as machine learning. SERS has potential to deepen our understanding of brain diseases, enhancing diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutic interventions. Such advancements could significantly enhance the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and further our understanding of brain-related processes and diseases. This review assesses the utility of SERS in diagnosing and understanding the pathophysiological basis of brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, stroke, and brain cancer. Recent technological advances in SERS instrumentation and techniques are discussed, including innovations in nanoparticle design, substrate materials, and imaging technologies. We also explore prospects and emerging trends, offering insights into new technologies, while also addressing various challenges and limitations associated with SERS in brain research.

Reduced facial expressions (i.e., hypomimia) is a common feature in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and previous studies linked this manifestation to both motor symptoms of the disease and altered emotion recognition and processing. Nevertheless, research on facial motor impairment in PD has been rather scarce and only a limited number of clinical evaluation tools are available, often suffering from poor validation processes and high inter- and intra-rater variability. In recent years, the availability of technology-enhanced quantification methods of facial movements, such as automated video analysis and machine learning application, led to increasing interest in studying hypomimia in PD. In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge on pathophysiological hypotheses at the basis of hypomimia in PD, with particular focus on the association between reduced facial expressions and emotional processing and analyze the current evaluation tools and management strategies for this symptom, as well as future research perspectives.

Amo-Salas, Javier; Olivares-Gil, Alicia; García-Bustillo, Álvaro; García-García, David; Arnaiz-González, Álvar; Cubo, Esther	Computer Vision for Parkinson’s Disease Evaluation: A Survey on Finger Tapping	Healthcare	EN	Review	Parkinson’s disease; finger tapping; machine learning; computer vision	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose prevalence has steadily been rising over the years. Specialist neurologists across the world assess and diagnose patients with PD, although the diagnostic process is time-consuming and various symptoms take years to appear, which means that the diagnosis is prone to human error. The partial automatization of PD assessment and diagnosis through computational processes has therefore been considered for some time. One well-known tool for PD assessment is finger tapping (FT), which can now be assessed through computer vision (CV). Artificial intelligence and related advances over recent decades, more specifically in the area of CV, have made it possible to develop computer systems that can help specialists assess and diagnose PD. The aim of this study is to review some advances related to CV techniques and FT so as to offer insight into future research lines that technological advances are now opening up.

Yue, Peng; Li, Ziheng; Zhou, Menghui; Wang, Xulong; Yang, Po	Wearable-Sensor-Based Weakly Supervised Parkinson’s Disease Assessment with Data Augmentation	Sensors	EN	Article	Parkinson’s disease; activity recognition; wearable sensor; weak annotation; class imbalance; data augmentation	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent dementia in the world. Wearable technology has been useful in the computer-aided diagnosis and long-term monitoring of PD in recent years. The fundamental issue remains how to assess the severity of PD using wearable devices in an efficient and accurate manner. However, in the real-world free-living environment, there are two difficult issues, poor annotation and class imbalance, both of which could potentially impede the automatic assessment of PD. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for assessing the severity of PD patient’s in a free-living environment. Specifically, we use clustering methods to learn latent categories from the same activities, while latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models are utilized to capture latent features from multiple activities. Then, to mitigate the impact of data imbalance, we augment bag-level data while retaining key instance prototypes. To comprehensively demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, we collected a dataset containing wearable-sensor signals from 83 individuals in real-life free-living conditions. The experimental results show that our framework achieves an astounding 73.48% accuracy in the fine-grained (normal, mild, moderate, severe) classification of PD severity based on hand movements. Overall, this study contributes to more accurate PD self-diagnosis in the wild, allowing doctors to provide remote drug intervention guidance.

Oláh, Judit; Norris, Vic; Lehotzky, Attila; Ovádi, Judit	Perspective Strategies for Interventions in Parkinsonism: Remedying the Neglected Role of TPPP	Cells	EN	Perspective	Parkinsonism; methodologies; alpha-synuclein; TPPP; drug targeting	Neurological disorders such as Parkinsonism cause serious socio-economic problems as there are, at present, only therapies that treat their symptoms. The well-established hallmark alpha-synuclein (SYN) is enriched in the inclusion bodies characteristic of Parkinsonism. We discovered a prominent partner of SYN, termed Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Protein (TPPP), which has important physiological and pathological activities such as the regulation of the microtubule network and the promotion of SYN aggregation. The role of TPPP in Parkinsonism is often neglected in research, which we here attempt to remedy. In the normal brain, SYN and TPPP are expressed endogenously in neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, whilst, at an early stage of Parkinsonism, soluble hetero-associations of these proteins are found in both cell types. The cell-to-cell transmission of these proteins, which is central to disease progression, provides a unique situation for specific drug targeting. Different strategies for intervention and for the discovery of biomarkers include (i) interface targeting of the SYN-TPPP hetero-complex; (ii) proteolytic degradation of SYN and/or TPPP using the PROTAC technology; and (iii) depletion of the proteins by miRNA technology. We also discuss the potential roles of SYN and TPPP in the phenotype stabilization of neurons and oligodendrocytes.

Beghini, Daniela; Kasai-Brunswick, Tais; Henriques-Pons, Andrea	Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells in Drug Discovery and Neurodegenerative Disease Modelling	International Journal of Molecular Sciences	EN	Review	induced pluripotent stem cells; disease modelling; neurodegenerative diseases	Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are derived from reprogrammed adult somatic cells. These adult cells are manipulated in vitro to express genes and factors essential for acquiring and maintaining embryonic stem cell (ESC) properties. This technology is widely applied in many fields, and much attention has been given to developing iPSC-based disease models to validate drug discovery platforms and study the pathophysiological molecular processes underlying disease onset. Especially in neurological diseases, there is a great need for iPSC-based technological research, as these cells can be obtained from each patient and carry the individual’s bulk of genetic mutations and unique properties. Moreover, iPSCs can differentiate into multiple cell types. These are essential characteristics, since the study of neurological diseases is affected by the limited access to injury sites, the need for in vitro models composed of various cell types, the complexity of reproducing the brain’s anatomy, the challenges of postmortem cell culture, and ethical issues. Neurodegenerative diseases strongly impact global health due to their high incidence, symptom severity, and lack of effective therapies. Recently, analyses using disease specific, iPSC-based models confirmed the efficacy of these models for testing multiple drugs. This review summarizes the advances in iPSC technology used in disease modelling and drug testing, with a primary focus on neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.

Channa, Asma; Ruggeri, Giuseppe; Ifrim, Rares-Cristian; Mammone, Nadia; Iera, Antonio; Popescu, Nirvana	Cloud-Connected Bracelet for Continuous Monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease Patients: Integrating Advanced Wearable Technologies and Machine Learning	Electronics	EN	Article	smart bracelet; Parkinson’s disease; internet of things; cloud computing; remote monitoring; tremor; bradykinesia; severity analysis	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most unremitting and dynamic neurodegenerative human diseases. Various wearable IoT devices have emerged for detecting, diagnosing, and quantifying PD, predominantly utilizing inertial sensors and computational algorithms. However, their proliferation poses novel challenges concerning security, privacy, connectivity, and power optimization. Clinically, continuous monitoring of patients’ motor function is imperative for optimizing Levodopa (L-dopa) dosage while mitigating adverse effects and motor activity decline. Tracking motor function alterations between visits is challenging, risking erroneous clinical decisions. Thus, there is a pressing need to furnish medical professionals with an ecosystem facilitating comprehensive Parkinson’s stage evaluation and disease progression monitoring, particularly regarding tremor and bradykinesia. This study endeavors to establish a holistic ecosystem centered around an energy-efficient Wi-Fi-enabled wearable bracelet dubbed A-WEAR. A-WEAR functions as a data collection conduit for Parkinson’s-related motion data, securely transmitting them to the Cloud for storage, processing, and severity estimation via bespoke learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the resilience and effectiveness of the suggested technique, with 86.4% accuracy for bradykinesia and 90.9% accuracy for tremor estimation, along with good sensitivity and specificity for each scoring class. The recommended approach will support the timely determination of the severity of PD and ongoing patient activity monitoring. The system helps medical practitioners in decision making when initially assessing patients with PD and reviewing their progress and the effects of any treatment.

Turner, Ben; Cranston, David	A Review of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound	International Journal of Translational Medicine	EN	Review	high-intensity focused ultrasound; minimally invasive surgery; abdominal malignancy; targeted drug delivery	For 80 years, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been the subject of interest in medical research. It is a non-invasive procedure that causes the death of cells in a very select area through one of two mechanisms, either heat or cavitation. While diagnostic ultrasound is well known in the medical profession and ultrasound is also used in physiotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound is less known but is becoming increasingly important as a non-invasive tool that can be used in many ways, including in the treatment of several cancers as well as benign uterine fibroids. Other interesting developments are underway, including its use in the treatment through an intact skull of essential tremors and the tremor associated with Parkinson’s disease, and in a modified form, it is used to target drug delivery to the brain due to its potential opening of the blood–brain barrier. The depth of penetration of HIFU is variable depending on the type of transducer used and the distance from it. Clinical trials of abdominal malignancies and benign uterine fibroids are reviewed in this article along with potential side effects of the procedure. Over the past two decades, the technology has improved considerably, and the clinical indications have broadened. The current limitations of the technology are also discussed, along with the potential advances in the field that may be made over the next decade.

In invasive therapies, metallic electrodes are utilized, which are implanted in patients. One of these invasive therapeutic procedures is deep brain stimulation (DBS), an effective therapy for addressing the motor disorders observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). This therapy involves the implantation of electrodes (IEs) into the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, there is still a need for the optimization of these electrodes. Plasma-synthesized polypyrrole doped with iodine (PPPy/I) has been reported as a biocompatible and anti-inflammatory biomaterial that promotes nervous system regeneration. Given this information, the objective of the present study was to develop and characterize a PPPy/I-coated electrode for implantation into the STN. The characterization results indicate a uniform coating along the electrode, and physical–chemical characterization studies were conducted on the polymer. Subsequently, the IEs, both coated and uncoated with PPPy/I, were implanted into the STN of male rats of the Wistar strain to conduct an electrographic recording (EG-R) study. The results demonstrate that the IE coated with PPPy/I exhibited superior power and frequency signals over time compared to the uncoated IE (p < 0.05). Based on these findings, we conclude that an IE coated with PPPy/I has optimized functional performance, with enhanced integrity and superior signal quality compared to an uncoated IE. Therefore, we consider this a promising technological development that could significantly improve functional outcomes for patients undergoing invasive brain therapies.

This study assesses the feasibility and performance of a new wearable tool for supporting the diagnosis of Parkinsonian motor syndromes. The proposed method is based on the use of a wrist-worn measuring system, the execution of a passive, continuous recording session, and a computation of two digital biomarkers (i.e., motor activity and rest tremor index). Based on the execution of some motor tests, a second step is provided for the confirmation of the results of passive recording. In this study, fifty-nine early PD patients and forty-one healthy controls were recruited. The results of this study show that: (a) motor activity was higher in controls than in PD with slight tremors at rest and did not significantly differ between controls and PD with mild-to-moderate tremor rest; (b) the tremor index was smaller in controls than in PD with mild-to-moderate tremor rest and did not significantly differ between controls and PD patients with slight tremor rest; (c) the combination of the said two motor parameters improved the performances in differentiating controls from PD. These preliminary findings demonstrate that the combination of said two digital biomarkers allowed us to differentiate controls from early PD.

Since there is currently no treatment for PD, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis, including the mechanisms of the switch from adaptation in the form of unfolded protein response (UPR) to apoptosis under ER stress conditions, may help in the search for treatment methods. Genetically encoded biosensors based on fluorescent proteins are suitable tools that facilitate the study of living cells and visualization of molecular events in real time. The combination of technologies to generate patient-specific iPSC lines and genetically encoded biosensors allows the creation of cell models with new properties. Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated homologous recombination at the AAVS1 locus of iPSC with the genetic variant p.N370S (rs76763715) in the GBA1 gene, we created a cell model designed to study the activation conditions of the IRE1-XBP1 cascade of the UPR system. The cell lines obtained have a doxycycline-dependent expression of the genetically encoded biosensor XBP1-TagRFP, possess all the properties of human pluripotent cells, and can be used to test physical conditions and chemical compounds that affect the development of ER stress, the functioning of the UPR system, and in particular, the IRE1-XBP1 cascade.

Wearable lower limb exoskeletons (LLEs) have emerged as a promising solution to enhance physical function in older individuals. This systematic review synthesizes the use of LLEs in alignment with the WHO’s healthy aging vision, examining their impact on intrinsic capacities and functional abilities. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in six databases, yielding 36 relevant articles covering older adults (65+) with various health conditions, including sarcopenia, stroke, Parkinson’s Disease, osteoarthritis, and more. The interventions, spanning one to forty sessions, utilized a range of LLE technologies such as Ekso®, HAL®, Stride Management Assist®, Honda Walking Assist®, Lokomat®, Walkbot®, Healbot®, Keeogo Rehab®, EX1®, overground wearable exoskeletons, Eksoband®, powered ankle–foot orthoses, HAL® lumbar type, Human Body Posturizer®, Gait Enhancing and Motivation System®, soft robotic suits, and active pelvis orthoses. The findings revealed substantial positive outcomes across diverse health conditions. LLE training led to improvements in key performance indicators, such as the 10 Meter Walk Test, Five Times Sit-to-Stand test, Timed Up and Go test, and more. Additionally, enhancements were observed in gait quality, joint mobility, muscle strength, and balance. These improvements were accompanied by reductions in sedentary behavior, pain perception, muscle exertion, and metabolic cost while walking. While longer intervention durations can aid in the rehabilitation of intrinsic capacities, even the instantaneous augmentation of functional abilities can be observed in a single session. In summary, this review demonstrates consistent and significant enhancements in critical parameters across a broad spectrum of health conditions following LLE interventions in older adults. These findings underscore the potential of LLE in promoting healthy aging and enhancing the well-being of older adults.

The project PARMODE aims to record accurate gait measurements in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and proceed with an in-depth analysis of the gait characteristics, while the project CPWATCHER aims to assess the quality of hand movement in cerebral palsy patients. The device was mainly developed to serve the first project with additional offline processing, including machine learning algorithms that could potentially be used for the second aim. A key feature of the device is its small size (36 mm × 46 mm × 16 mm, weight: 14 g), which was designed to meet specific requirements in terms of device consumption restrictions due to the small size of the battery and the need for autonomous operation for more than ten hours.

Lee, Dae-Hwan; Woo, Bong-Sik; Park, Yong-Hwa; Lee, Jung-Ho	General Treatments Promoting Independent Living in Parkinson’s Patients and Physical Therapy Approaches for Improving Gait—A Comprehensive Review	Medicina	EN	Review	Parkinson disease; gait; rehabilitation; physical therapy; RAGT	This study delves into the multifaceted approaches to treating Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting motor function but also manifesting in a variety of symptoms that vary greatly among individuals. The complexity of PD symptoms necessitates a comprehensive treatment strategy that integrates surgical interventions, pharmacotherapy, and physical therapy to tailor to the unique needs of each patient. Surgical options, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), have been pivotal for patients not responding adequately to medication, offering significant symptom relief. Pharmacotherapy remains a cornerstone of PD management, utilizing drugs like levodopa, dopamine agonists, and others to manage symptoms and, in some cases, slow down disease progression. However, these treatments often lead to complications over time, such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, highlighting the need for precise dosage adjustments and sometimes combination therapies to optimize patient outcomes. Physical therapy plays a critical role in addressing the motor symptoms of PD, including bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, tremors, postural instability, and akinesia. PT techniques are tailored to improve mobility, balance, strength, and overall quality of life. Strategies such as gait and balance training, strengthening exercises, stretching, and functional training are employed to mitigate symptoms and enhance functional independence. Specialized approaches like proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), the Bobath concept, and the use of assistive devices are also integral to the rehabilitation process, aimed at improving patients’ ability to perform daily activities and reducing the risk of falls. Innovations in technology have introduced robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) and other assistive devices, offering new possibilities for patient care. These tools provide targeted support and feedback, allowing for more intensive and personalized rehabilitation sessions. Despite these advancements, high costs and accessibility issues remain challenges that need addressing. The inclusion of exercise and activity beyond structured PT sessions is encouraged, with evidence suggesting that regular physical activity can have neuroprotective effects, potentially slowing disease progression. Activities such as treadmill walking, cycling, and aquatic exercises not only improve physical symptoms but also contribute to emotional well-being and social interactions. In conclusion, treating PD requires a holistic approach that combines medical, surgical, and therapeutic strategies. While there is no cure, the goal is to maximize patients’ functional abilities and quality of life through personalized treatment plans. This integrated approach, along with ongoing research and development of new therapies, offers hope for improving the management of PD and the lives of those affected by this challenging disease.

Crucial to these conditions is the gradual degradation of the central nervous system, manifesting as impairments in mobility, aberrant behaviors, and cognitive deficits. Mechanisms such as proteotoxic stress, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and programmed cell death contribute to the ongoing dysfunction and demise of neurons. Presently, neurodegenerative diseases lack definitive cures, and available therapies primarily offer palliative relief. The integration of nanotechnology into medical practices has significantly augmented both treatment efficacy and diagnostic capabilities. Nanoparticles, capable of traversing the blood–brain barrier, hold considerable potential for diagnosing and treating brain pathologies. By combining gene therapy with nanotechnology, the therapeutic effectiveness against neurodegenerative diseases can be substantially enhanced. Recent advancements in nano-biomaterial-based methodologies have fortified existing approaches to neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation therapies. NSC-targeting technologies offer a promising, potentially safe method for treating neurodegenerative diseases. This review endeavors to summarize current insights and perspectives on nanotechnology-driven therapeutic innovations in neurodegenerative disorders, with a particular emphasis on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

All 17 studies demonstrated balance and gait performance improvement in older adults and in individuals with stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis following 4 or more weeks of interactive telerehabilitation via virtual reality, smartphone or tablet apps, or videoconferencing. The findings of this systematic review can inform the future design and implementation of interactive telerehabilitation technology and improve balance and gait training exercise regimens for older adults and individuals with neurological conditions.

Poplawska-Domaszewicz, Karolina; Limbachiya, Naomi; Lau, Yue; Chaudhuri, Kallol	Parkinson’s Kinetigraph for Wearable Sensor Detection of Clinically Unrecognized Early-Morning Akinesia in Parkinson’s Disease: A Case Report-Based Observation	Sensors	EN	Brief Report	Parkinson’s disease; PKG; early-morning off; early-morning akinesia	Early-morning off periods, causing early-morning akinesia, can lead to significant motor and nonmotor morbidity in levodopa-treated fluctuating Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases. Despite validated bedside scales in clinical practice, such early-morning off periods may remain undetected unless specific wearable technologies, such as the Parkinson’s KinetiGraph™ (PKG) watch, are used. We report five PD cases for whom the PKG detected early-morning off periods that were initially clinically undetected and as such, untreated. These five cases serve as exemplars of this clinical gap in care. Post-PKG assessment, clinicians were alerted and targeted therapies helped abolish the early-morning off periods.

Simonet, Arnaud; Fourcade, Paul; Loete, Florent; Delafontaine, Arnaud; Yiou, Eric	Evaluation of the Margin of Stability during Gait Initiation in Young Healthy Adults, Elderly Healthy Adults and Patients with Parkinson’s Disease: A Comparison of Force Plate and Markerless Motion Capture Systems	Sensors	EN	Article	markerless motion capture; force plate; gait initiation; margin of stability; Bland–Altman; Bayes factor 01; Parkinson’s disease; healthy adults; biomechanics	Gait initiation (GI) is a functional task classically used in the literature to evaluate the capacity of individuals to maintain postural stability. Postural stability during GI can be evaluated through the “margin of stability” (MoS), a variable that is often computed from force plate recordings. The markerless motion capture system (MLS) is a recent innovative technology based on deep learning that has the potential to compute the MoS. This study tested the agreement between a force plate measurement system (FPS, gold standard) and an MLS to compute the MoS during GI. Healthy adults (young [YH] and elderly [EH]) and Parkinson’s disease patients (PD) performed GI series at spontaneous (SVC) and maximum velocity (MVC) on an FPS while being filmed by a MLS. Descriptive statistics revealed a significant effect of the group (YH vs. EH vs. PD) and velocity condition (SVC vs. MVC) on the MoS but failed to reveal any significant effect of the system (MLS vs. PFS) or interaction between factors. Bland–Altman plot analysis further showed that mean MoS biases were zero in all groups and velocity conditions, while the Bayes factor 01 indicated “moderate evidence” that both systems provided equivalent MoS. Trial-by-trial analysis of Bland–Altman plots, however, revealed that differences of >20% between the two systems did occur. Globally taken, these findings suggest that the two systems are similarly effective in detecting an effect of the group and velocity on the MoS. These findings may have important implications in both clinical and laboratory settings due to the ease of use of the MLS compared to the FPS.

Silva-Batista, Carla; de Almeida, Filipe; Wilhelm, Jennifer; Horak, Fay; Mancini, Martina; King, Laurie	Telerehabilitation by Videoconferencing for Balance and Gait in People with Parkinson’s Disease: A Scoping Review	Geriatrics	EN	Review	Parkinson’s disease; telerehabilitation; videoconferencing; remote; mobility	Although supervised and real-time telerehabilitation by videoconferencing is now becoming common for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD), its efficacy for balance and gait is still unclear. This paper uses a scoping approach to review the current evidence on the effects of telerehabilitation by videoconferencing on balance and gait for patients with PD. We also explored whether studies have used wearable technology during telerehabilitation to assess and treat balance and gait via videoconferencing. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, ISI’s Web of Knowledge, Cochrane’s Library, and Embase. The data were extracted for study design, treatment, and outcomes. Fourteen studies were included in this review. Of these, seven studies investigated the effects of telerehabilitation (e.g., tele-yoga and adapted physiotherapy exercises) on balance and gait measures (e.g., self-reported balance, balance scale, walking speed, mobility, and motor symptoms) using videoconferencing in both assessment and treatment. The telerehabilitation programs by videoconferencing were feasible and safe for people with PD; however, the efficacy still needs to be determined, as only four studies had a parallel group. In addition, no study used wearable technology. Robust evidence of the effects of telerehabilitation by videoconferencing on balance and gait for patients with PD was not found, suggesting that future powered, prospective, and robust clinical trials are needed.

Indoor cycling is a good and safe option for this population, but some barriers (monotonous and repetitive environment, lack of monitoring, and an inability to compete with others) could limit its use. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) could be a possible solution to some of these drawbacks, increasing patient motivation and thus adherence to forced exercise programs using cycloergometers. A double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted to explore the feasibility and effects of the ReViPark program (high-intensity pedaling + IVR for 3 months with two sessions per week) on PD progression. In all, 52 people with PD were allocated to the ReViPark group (n = 30; 70.87 ± 6.67 years) and smart cycloergometer group (n = 22; 70.59 ± 6.67 years). This program was feasible, with no adverse effects (no significant Simulator Sickness Questionnaire symptoms and a low negative experience rating for the Game Experience Questionnaire (0.04/4)), no dropouts, high adherence, and good usability (System Usability Scale score of 82.90%). The ReViPark group showed significant improvements in functionality, quality of life, and disease progression as measured by their balance, gait and risk of falling (Timed Up and Go p = 0.028; Tinetti test p = 0.046), PDQ-39 scores (p = 0.035), and MDS-UPDRS scores (p = 0.001). This program is feasible and could lead to improvements in the functional parameters, quality of life, and symptomatology of the participants.

Elbatanouny, Hagar; Kleanthous, Natasa; Dahrouj, Hayssam; Alusi, Sundus; Almajali, Eqab; Mahmoud, Soliman; Hussain, Abir	Insights into Parkinson’s Disease-Related Freezing of Gait Detection and Prediction Approaches: A Meta Analysis	Sensors	EN	Review	Parkinson’s disease; FOG prediction; machine learning; explainable AI; wearable sensors; cueing devices	Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a spectrum of motor and non-motor symptoms, prominently featuring the freezing of gait (FOG), which significantly impairs patients’ quality of life. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying FOG remain elusive, posing challenges for effective management and treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive meta-analysis of FOG prediction and detection methodologies, with a focus on the integration of wearable sensor technology and machine learning (ML) approaches. Through an exhaustive review of the literature, this study identifies key trends, datasets, preprocessing techniques, feature extraction methods, evaluation metrics, and comparative analyses between ML and non-ML approaches. The analysis also explores the utilization of cueing devices. The limited adoption of explainable AI (XAI) approaches in FOG prediction research represents a significant gap. Improving user acceptance and comprehension requires an understanding of the logic underlying algorithm predictions. Current FOG detection and prediction research has a number of limitations, which are identified in the discussion. These include issues with cueing devices, dataset constraints, ethical and privacy concerns, financial and accessibility restrictions, and the requirement for multidisciplinary collaboration. Future research avenues center on refining explainability, expanding and diversifying datasets, adhering to user requirements, and increasing detection and prediction accuracy. The findings contribute to advancing the understanding of FOG and offer valuable guidance for the development of more effective detection and prediction methodologies, ultimately benefiting individuals affected by PD.

Aging-related symptoms as well as disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms contribute to these conditions and should be treated when appropriate. In addition to an active lifestyle, advanced exercise training is useful and effective, especially for less medically responsive symptoms such as freezing of gait and postural instability at advanced stages. As treadmill training in non-immersive virtual reality, including dual tasks, significantly reduced the number of falls in PD patients, the mechanism(s) explaining this effect should be further investigated. Such research could help to select the most suitable patients and develop the most effective training protocols based on this novel technology. Real-life digital surrogate markers of mobility, such as those describing aspects of endurance, performance, and the complexity of specific movements, can further improve the quality of mobility assessment using wearables.

Shuqair, Mustafa; Jimenez-Shahed, Joohi; Ghoraani, Behnaz	Multi-Shared-Task Self-Supervised CNN-LSTM for Monitoring Free-Body Movement UPDRS-III Using Wearable Sensors	Bioengineering	EN	Article	Parkinson’s disease; deep learning; self-supervised learning; wearable systems; health monitoring	The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is used to recognize patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and rate its severity. The rating is crucial for disease progression monitoring and treatment adjustment. This study aims to advance the capabilities of PD management by developing an innovative framework that integrates deep learning with wearable sensor technology to enhance the precision of UPDRS assessments. We introduce a series of deep learning models to estimate UPDRS Part III scores, utilizing motion data from wearable sensors. Our approach leverages a novel Multi-shared-task Self-supervised Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) framework that processes raw gyroscope signals and their spectrogram representations. This technique aims to refine the estimation accuracy of PD severity during naturalistic human activities. Utilizing 526 min of data from 24 PD patients engaged in everyday activities, our methodology demonstrates a strong correlation of 0.89 between estimated and clinically assessed UPDRS-III scores. This model outperforms the benchmark set by single and multichannel CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models and establishes a new standard in UPDRS-III score estimation for free-body movements compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. These results signify a substantial step forward in bioengineering applications for PD monitoring, providing a robust framework for reliable and continuous assessment of PD symptoms in daily living settings.

This study delves into the field of non-invasive brain neuromodulation, a safer and potentially effective approach for treating a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Unlike traditional deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, non-invasive techniques employ ultrasound, electrical currents, and electromagnetic field stimulation to stimulate the brain from outside the skull, thereby eliminating surgery risks and enhancing patient comfort. This study explores the mechanisms of various modalities, including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), highlighting their potential to address chronic pain, anxiety, Parkinson’s disease, and depression. We also probe into the concept of closed-loop neuromodulation, which personalizes stimulation based on real-time brain activity. While we acknowledge the limitations of current technologies, our study concludes by proposing future research avenues to advance this rapidly evolving field with its immense potential to revolutionize neurological and psychiatric care and lay the foundation for the continuing advancement of innovative non-invasive brain sensing technologies.

Ji, Miaoxin; Ren, Renhao; Zhang, Wei; Xu, Qiangwei	Automatic Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis with Wearable Sensor Technology for Medical Robot	Electronics	EN	Article	wearable sensors; Parkinson’s disease; gait analysis; feature extraction; medical robotic	The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been the subject of medical robotics research. Currently, a hot research topic is how to accurately assess the severity of Parkinson’s disease patients and enable medical robots to better assist patients in the rehabilitation process. The walking task on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a well-established diagnostic criterion for PD patients. However, the clinical diagnosis of PD is determined based on the clinical experience of neurologists, which is subjective and inaccurate. Therefore, in this study, an automated diagnostic method for PD based on an improved multiclass support vector machine (MCSVM) is proposed in which wearable sensors are used. Kinematic analysis was performed to extract gait features, both spatiotemporal and kinematic, from the installed IMU and pressure sensors. Comparison experiments of three different kernel functions and linear trajectory experiments were designed. The experimental results show that the accuracies of the three kernel functions of the proposed improved MCSVM are 92.43%, 93.45%, and 95.35%. The simulation trajectories of the MCSVM are the closest to the real trajectories, which shows that the technique performs better in the clinical diagnosis of PD.

Quan, Wei; Liu, Shikai; Cao, Meng; Zhao, Jiale	A Comprehensive Review of Virtual Reality Technology for Cognitive Rehabilitation in Patients with Neurological Conditions	Applied Sciences	EN	Review	virtual reality; neurological disorders; cognitive rehabilitation	Amidst population aging and lifestyle shifts, the incidence of neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease is increasing, profoundly affecting patients’ cognitive functions and everyday life. Conventional cognitive rehabilitation approaches often necessitate substantial time and manpower, yet their outcomes remain uncertain. Although computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation offers convenience, it can be somewhat monotonous in its experience. Virtual reality (VR) technology has introduced a novel pathway for cognitive rehabilitation, enhancing personalization and outcome assessment through tailored immersive environments and real-time data recording. This paper aims to survey the application of VR in cognitive rehabilitation, examining its impact on improving memory, attention, motor function, and social skills. A systematic review methodology was employed, following PRISMA guidelines, to identify and analyze relevant studies from 2010 to 2023. Recognizing that patients with different conditions have varying needs for the immersive and social aspects of VR, we propose the Multi-Dimensional VR Cognitive Rehabilitation Theory Model (MD-VRCRTM). This model categorizes cognitive rehabilitation technologies into six primary types: individual immersive, individual semi-immersive, individual non-immersive, multiplayer immersive, multiplayer semi-immersive, and multiplayer non-immersive rehabilitation systems. This categorization aims to cater to the specific requirements of various patients. For instance, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may benefit more from multiplayer VR applications to enhance social skills; those with Parkinson’s disease (PD) might profit from immersive VR to facilitate motor function recovery; stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients may require highly immersive VR experiences to boost concentration and treatment efficacy; and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients may be better suited to non-immersive or semi-immersive VR to minimize cognitive load and receive cognitive stimulation.

Despite significant advancements in sensor technologies, challenges remain in developing cost-effective, user-friendly, and reliable systems for gait detection and sonification. This study introduces a novel wearable personalised sonification and biofeedback device to enhance movement awareness for individuals with irregular gait and posture. Through the integration of inertial measurement units (IMUs), MATLAB, and sophisticated audio feedback mechanisms, the device offers real-time, intuitive cues to facilitate gait correction and improve functional mobility. Utilising a single wearable sensor attached to the L4 vertebrae, the system captures kinematic parameters to generate auditory feedback through discrete and continuous tones corresponding to heel strike events and sagittal plane rotations. A preliminary test that involved 20 participants under various audio feedback conditions was conducted to assess the system’s accuracy, reliability, and user synchronisation. The results indicate a promising improvement in movement awareness facilitated by auditory cues. This suggests a potential for enhancing gait and balance, particularly beneficial for individuals with compromised gait or those undergoing a rehabilitation process. This paper details the development process, experimental setup, and initial findings, discussing the integration challenges and future research directions. It also presents a novel approach to providing real-time feedback to participants about their balance, potentially enabling them to make immediate adjustments to their posture and movement. Future research should evaluate this method in varied real-world settings and populations, including the elderly and individuals with Parkinson’s disease.

Rudroff, Thorsten	Artificial Intelligence as a Replacement for Animal Experiments in Neurology: Potential, Progress, and Challenges	Neurology International	EN	Perspective	artificial intelligence; animal experiments; biomedical datasets; pharmacology	Animal experimentation has long been a cornerstone of neurology research, but it faces growing scientific, ethical, and economic challenges. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are providing new opportunities to replace animal testing with more human-relevant and efficient methods. This article explores the potential of AI technologies such as brain organoids, computational models, and machine learning to revolutionize neurology research and reduce reliance on animal models. These approaches can better recapitulate human brain physiology, predict drug responses, and uncover novel insights into neurological disorders. They also offer faster, cheaper, and more ethical alternatives to animal experiments. Case studies demonstrate AI’s ability to accelerate drug discovery for Alzheimer’s, predict neurotoxicity, personalize treatments for Parkinson’s, and restore movement in paralysis. While challenges remain in validating and integrating these technologies, the scientific, economic, practical, and moral advantages are driving a paradigm shift towards AI-based, animal-free research in neurology. With continued investment and collaboration across sectors, AI promises to accelerate the development of safer and more effective therapies for neurological conditions while significantly reducing animal use. The path forward requires the ongoing development and validation of these technologies, but a future in which they largely replace animal experiments in neurology appears increasingly likely. This transition heralds a new era of more humane, human-relevant, and innovative brain research.

Moore, Jason; Celik, Yunus; Stuart, Samuel; McMeekin, Peter; Walker, Richard; Hetherington, Victoria; Godfrey, Alan	Using Video Technology and AI within Parkinson’s Disease Free-Living Fall Risk Assessment	Sensors	EN	Article	wearable technology; inertial measurement units (IMUs); environmental context; artificial intelligence (AI); gait analysis; eye-tracking; privacy; ethics; thematic analysis	Falls are a major concern for people with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD), but accurately assessing real-world fall risk beyond the clinic is challenging. Contemporary technologies could enable the capture of objective and high-resolution data to better inform fall risk through measurement of everyday factors (e.g., obstacles) that contribute to falls. Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) capture objective high-resolution walking/gait data in all environments but are limited by not providing absolute clarity on contextual information (i.e., obstacles) that could greatly influence how gait is interpreted. Video-based data could compliment IMU-based data for a comprehensive free-living fall risk assessment. The objective of this study was twofold. First, pilot work was conducted to propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for use with wearable video-based eye-tracking glasses to compliment IMU gait data in order to better inform free-living fall risk in PwPD. The suggested approach (based on a fine-tuned You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) object detection algorithm) can accurately detect and contextualize objects (mAP50 = 0.81) in the environment while also providing insights into where the PwPD is looking, which could better inform fall risk. Second, we investigated the perceptions of PwPD via a focus group discussion regarding the adoption of video technologies and AI during their everyday lives to better inform their own fall risk. This second aspect of the study is important as, traditionally, there may be clinical and patient apprehension due to ethical and privacy concerns on the use of wearable cameras to capture real-world video. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse transcripts and develop core themes and categories. Here, PwPD agreed on ergonomically designed wearable video-based glasses as an optimal mode of video data capture, ensuring discreteness and negating any public stigma on the use of research-style equipment. PwPD also emphasized the need for control in AI-assisted data processing to uphold privacy, which could overcome concerns with the adoption of video to better inform IMU-based gait and free-living fall risk. Contemporary technologies (wearable video glasses and AI) can provide a holistic approach to fall risk that PwPD recognise as helpful and safe to use.

This review explores the cutting-edge innovations in brain stimulation techniques, including their applications in alleviating symptoms of main neurodegenerative disorders and addiction. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an FDA-approved treatment for specific neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s Disease (PD), and is currently under evaluation for other conditions, such as Alzheimer’s Disease. This technique has facilitated significant advancements in understanding brain electrical circuitry by enabling targeted brain stimulation and providing insights into neural network function and dysfunction. In reviewing DBS studies, this review places particular emphasis on the underlying main neurotransmitter modifications and their specific brain area location, particularly focusing on the dopaminergic system, which plays a critical role in these conditions. Furthermore, this review delves into the groundbreaking developments in nanomedicine, highlighting how nanotechnology can be utilized to target aberrant signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, with a specific focus on the dopaminergic system. The discussion extends to emerging technologies such as magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENPs), which represent a novel intersection between nanoformulation and brain stimulation approaches. These innovative technologies offer promising avenues for enhancing the precision and effectiveness of treatments by enabling the non-invasive, targeted delivery of therapeutic agents as well as on-site, on-demand stimulation. By integrating insights from recent research and technological advances, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how brain stimulation and nanomedicine can be synergistically applied to address complex neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, paving the way for future therapeutic strategies.

A second aim is to present the primary outcome measures used in clinical trials in cohorts of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The final aim is to discuss whether metabolomics using body fluids may lead to the discovery of biomarkers of neuroprotection. Information on the primary outcome measures in clinical trials related to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease registered since 2018 was collected. We analysed the type of measures selected to assess efficacy, not in terms of neuroprotection since, as stated in the aims, there is not yet any marker of neuroprotection. Proteomic approaches using plasma or CSF have been proposed. PET could estimate the extent of lesions, but disease progression does not necessarily correlate with a change in tracer uptake. We propose some alternatives based on considering the metabolome. A new opportunity opens with metabolomics because there have been impressive technological advances that allow the detection, among others, of metabolites related to mitochondrial function and mitochondrial structure in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid; some of the differentially concentrated metabolites can become reliable biomarkers of neuroprotection.

Kerstens, Rebecca; Joyce, Paul	The Gut Microbiome as a Catalyst and Emerging Therapeutic Target for Parkinson’s Disease: A Comprehensive Update	Biomedicines	EN	Review	microbiota; probiotics; prebiotics; microbiome therapeutics; microbial therapies; personalised medicine	Parkinson’s Disease is the second most prevalent neurological disorder globally, and its cause is still largely unknown. Likewise, there is no cure, and existing treatments do little more than subdue symptoms before becoming ineffective. It is increasingly important to understand the factors contributing to Parkinson’s Disease aetiology so that new and more effective pharmacotherapies can be established. In recent years, there has been an emergence of research linking gut dysbiosis to Parkinson’s Disease via the gut–brain axis. Advancements in microbial profiling have led to characterisation of a Parkinson’s-specific microbial signature, where novel treatments that leverage and correct gut dysbiosis are beginning to emerge for the safe and effective treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. Preliminary clinical studies investigating microbiome-targeted therapeutics for Parkinson’s Disease have revealed promising outcomes, and as such, the aim of this review is to provide a timely and comprehensive update of the most recent advances in this field. Faecal microbiota transplantation has emerged as a novel and potential frontrunner for microbial-based therapies due to their efficacy in alleviating Parkinson’s Disease symptomology through modulation of the gut–brain axis. However, more rigorous clinical investigation, along with technological advancements in diagnostic and in vitro testing tools, are critically required to facilitate the widespread clinical translation of microbiome-targeting Parkinson’s Disease therapeutics.

Caramiello, Alessio; Pirota, Valentina	Novel Therapeutic Horizons: SNCA Targeting in Parkinson’s Disease	Biomolecules	EN	Review	alpha-synuclein; Parkinson’s disease; SNCA gene; gene therapy; ASOs; G-quadruplex	Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) aggregates are the primary component of Lewy bodies, which are pathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The toxicity of αSyn seems to increase with its elevated expression during injury, suggesting that therapeutic approaches focused on reducing αSyn burden in neurons could be beneficial. Additionally, studies have shown higher levels of SNCA mRNA in the midbrain tissues and substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons of sporadic PD post-mortem brains compared to controls. Therefore, the regulation of SNCA expression and inhibition of αSyn synthesis could play an important role in the pathogenesis of injury, resulting in an effective treatment approach for PD. In this context, we summarized the most recent and innovative strategies proposed that exploit the targeting of SNCA to regulate translation and efficiently knock down cytoplasmatic levels of αSyn. Significant progress has been made in developing antisense technologies for treating PD in recent years, with a focus on antisense oligonucleotides and short-interfering RNAs, which achieve high specificity towards the desired target. To provide a more exhaustive picture of this research field, we also reported less common but highly innovative strategies, including small molecules, designed to specifically bind 5′-untranslated regions and, targeting secondary nucleic acid structures present in the SNCA gene, whose formation can be modulated, acting as a transcription and translation control. To fully describe the efficiency of the reported strategies, the effect of αSyn reduction on cellular viability and dopamine homeostasis was also considered.

Among the most recent rehabilitation technologies, a lower-limb powered exoskeleton (LLEXO) arises as a useful instrument for gait training in several neurological conditions, including PD. However, some questions relating to methods of use, achievable results, and usefulness compared to traditional rehabilitation methodologies still require clear answers. Therefore, in this review, we aim to summarise and analyse all the studies that have applied an LLEXO to train gait in PD patients. Literature research on PubMed and Scopus retrieved five articles, comprising 46 PD participants stable on medications (age: 71.7 ± 3.7 years, 24 males, Hoehn and Yahr: 2.1 ± 0.6). Compared to traditional rehabilitation, low-profile lower-limb exoskeleton (lp-LLEXO) training brought major improvements towards walking capacity and gait speed, while there are no clear major benefits regarding the dual-task gait cost index and freezing of gait symptoms. Importantly, the results suggest that lp-LLEXO training is more beneficial for patients with an intermediate-to-severe level of disease severity (Hoehn and Yahr > 2.5). This review could provide a novel framework for implementing LLEXO in clinical practise, highlighting its benefits and limitations towards gait training.

Assessment methods, despite the many years of existence of the disease, lack individualized visualization. On the other hand, virtual reality promises immersion and realism. In this paper, we develop an integrated system for visualizing the gestures of Parkinson’s disease patients in a virtual reality environment. With this application, clinicians will have information about the unique motor patterns and challenges they must address in each individual patient’s case, while the collected data can travel and be easily and instantly visualized in any location. At the beginning of this research, the current terms of immersive technologies in conjunction with data visualization and Parkinson’s disease are described. Through an extensive systematic literature review, the technological developments in the field of Parkinson’s data visualization are presented. The findings of the review lead to the experimental procedure and implementation of the application. The conclusions drawn from this work fuel future extensions on the contribution of immersive technologies to various diseases.

Goubault, Etienne; Duval, Christian; Martin, Camille; Lebel, Karina	Innovative Detection and Segmentation of Mobility Activities in Patients Living with Parkinson’s Disease Using a Single Ankle-Positioned Smartwatch	Sensors	EN	Article	activities of daily living; inertial sensors; automatic detection; movement disorders	Background: The automatic detection of activities of daily living (ADL) is necessary to improve long-term home-based monitoring of Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms. While most body-worn sensor algorithms for ADL detection were developed using laboratory research systems covering full-body kinematics, it is now crucial to achieve ADL detection using a single body-worn sensor that remains commercially available and affordable for ecological use. Aim: to detect and segment Walking, Turning, Sitting-down, and Standing-up activities of patients with PD using a Smartwatch positioned at the ankle. Method: Twenty-two patients living with PD performed a Timed Up and Go (TUG) task three times before engaging in cleaning ADL in a simulated free-living environment during a 3 min trial. Accelerations and angular velocities of the right or left ankle were recorded in three dimensions using a Smartwatch. The TUG task was used to develop detection algorithms for Walking, Turning, Sitting-down, and Standing-up, while the 3 min trial in the free-living environment was used to test and validate these algorithms. Sensitivity, specificity, and F-scores were calculated based on a manual segmentation of ADL. Results: Sensitivity, specificity, and F-scores were 96.5%, 94.7%, and 96.0% for Walking; 90.0%, 93.6%, and 91.7% for Turning; 57.5%, 70.5%, and 52.3% for Sitting-down; and 57.5%, 72.9%, and 54.1% for Standing-up. The median of time difference between the manual and automatic segmentation was 1.31 s for Walking, 0.71 s for Turning, 2.75 s for Sitting-down, and 2.35 s for Standing-up. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that segmenting ADL to characterize the mobility of people with PD based on a single Smartwatch can be comparable to manual segmentation while requiring significantly less time. While Walking and Turning were well detected, Sitting-down and Standing-up will require further investigation to develop better algorithms. Nonetheless, these achievements increase the odds of success in implementing wearable technologies for PD monitoring in ecological environments.

Remotely monitored wearable devices and sensors provide precise, objective, and frequent measures of motor and non-motor symptoms. Here, we used consumer-grade wearable device and sensor data from the WATCH-PD study to develop a PD screening tool aimed at eliminating the gap between patient symptoms and diagnosis. Early-stage PD patients (n = 82) and age-matched comparison participants (n = 50) completed a multidomain assessment battery during a one-year longitudinal multicenter study. Using disease- and behavior-relevant feature engineering and multivariate machine learning modeling of early-stage PD status, we developed a highly accurate (92.3%), sensitive (90.0%), and specific (100%) random forest classification model (AUC = 0.92) that performed well across environmental and platform contexts. These findings provide robust support for further exploration of consumer-grade wearable devices and sensors for global population-wide PD screening and surveillance.

However, many of these PD genes are poorly characterized in terms of their function, subcellular localization, and interaction with other components in cellular pathways. This represents a major obstacle towards a better understanding of the molecular causes of PD, with deeper molecular studies often hindered by a lack of high-quality, validated antibodies for detecting the corresponding proteins of interest. In this study, we leveraged the nanoluciferase-derived LgBiT-HiBiT system by generating a cohort of tagged PD genes in both induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neuronal cells. To promote luminescence signals within cells, a master iPSC line was generated, in which LgBiT expression is under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. LgBiT could bind to HiBiT when present either alone or when tagged onto different PD-associated proteins encoded by the genes GBA1, GPNMB, LRRK2, PINK1, PRKN, SNCA, VPS13C, and VPS35. Several HiBiT-tagged proteins could already generate luminescence in iPSCs in response to the doxycycline induction of LgBiT, with the enzyme glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GCase), encoded by GBA1, being one such example. Moreover, the GCase chaperone ambroxol elicited an increase in the luminescence signal in HiBiT-tagged GBA1 cells, correlating with an increase in the levels of GCase in dopaminergic cells. Taken together, we have developed and validated a Doxycycline-inducible luminescence system to serve as a sensitive assay for the quantification, localization, and activity of HiBiT-tagged PD-associated proteins with reliable sensitivity and efficiency.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of a smartphone application to measure spatiotemporal outcomes during level (primary) and uphill/downhill (secondary) walking with and without an assistive device for older adults (OAs), Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) populations. Methods: A total of 50 adults (OA = 20; PD = 15; CVA = 15) underwent gait analysis at self-selected gait speeds under 0-degree, 5-degree uphill and 5-degree downhill environments. The validity and reliability of the smartphone outcomes were compared to a motion-capture laboratory. Bland–Altman analysis was used to evaluate limits of agreement between the two systems. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine absolute agreement, and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to assess the strength of the association between the two systems. Results: For level walking, Bland–Altman analysis revealed relatively equal estimations of spatiotemporal outcomes between systems for OAs without an assistive device and slight to mild under- and overestimations of outcomes between systems for PD and CVA with and without an assistive device. Moderate to very high correlations between systems (without an assistive device: OA r-range, 0.72–0.99; PD r-range, 0.87–0.97; CVA r-range, 0.56–0.99; with an assistive device: PD r-range, 0.35–0.98; CVA r-range, 0.50–0.99) were also observed. Poor to excellent ICCs for reliability between systems (without an assistive device: OA ICC range, 0.71–0.99; PD ICC range, 0.73–0.97; CVA ICC range, 0.56–0.99; with an assistive device: PD ICC range, 0.22–0.98; CVA ICC range, 0.44–0.99) were observed across all outcomes. Conclusions: This smartphone application can be clinically useful in detecting most spatiotemporal outcomes in various walking environments for older and diseased adults at risk for mobility loss.

The significant increase in cases from 2.5 million in 1990 to 6.1 million in 2016, coupled with predictions of a further doubling by 2040, underscores an impending healthcare challenge. This escalation aligns with global demographic shifts, including rising life expectancy and a growing global population. The economic impact, notably in the U.S., reached $51.9 billion in 2017, with projections suggesting a 46% increase by 2037, emphasizing the substantial socio-economic implications for both patients and caregivers. Coupled with a worldwide demand for health workers that is expected to rise to 80 million by 2030, we have fertile ground for a pandemic. Methods: Our transdisciplinary research focused on early PD detection through running speech and continuous handwriting analysis, incorporating medical, biomedical engineering, AI, and linguistic expertise. The cohort comprised 30 participants, including 20 PD patients at stages 1–4 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale and 10 healthy controls. We employed advanced AI techniques to analyze correlation plots generated from speech and handwriting features, aiming to identify prodromal PD biomarkers. Results: The study revealed distinct speech and handwriting patterns in PD patients compared to controls. Our ParkinsonNet model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with F1 scores of 95.74% for speech and 96.72% for handwriting analyses. These findings highlight the potential of speech and handwriting as effective early biomarkers for PD. Conclusions: The integration of AI as a decision support system in analyzing speech and handwriting presents a promising approach for early PD detection. This methodology not only offers a novel diagnostic tool but also contributes to the broader understanding of PD’s early manifestations. Further research is required to validate these findings in larger, diverse cohorts and to integrate these tools into clinical practice for timely PD pre-diagnosis and management.

The development of tablet technology opens up opportunities for an effective analysis of the writing process of people suffering from Parkinson’s disease, aimed at supporting medical diagnosis using machine learning methods. Several approaches have been used and presented in the literature that discuss the analysis and understanding of images created during the writing of single words or sentences. In this study, we propose an analysis based on a sequence of sentences, which allows us to assess the evolution of writing over time. The study material consisted of handwriting image samples acquired in a group of 24 patients with PD and 24 healthy controls. The parameterization of the handwriting image samples was carried out using domain knowledge. Using the exhaustive search method, we selected the relevant features for the SVM algorithm performing binary classification. The results obtained were assessed using quality measures, including overall accuracy, which was 91.67%. The results were compared with competitive works on the same subject and seem to be better (a higher level of accuracy with a much smaller number of features than those presented by others).

Farah, Adriana	Designing Coffee for Health	Proceedings	EN	Abstract	coffee and health; chlorogenic acids; caffeine; trigonelline; stomach discomfort; acrylamide; mycotoxins; hypercholesterolemia; type 2 diabetes	The first scientific reports on coffee and health date back to the 16th century. Since then, coffee has been prescribed by physicians and used for several purposes, although controversies about its positive or negative effects on health were always present. Despite numerous attempts to decrease coffee’s popularity, favorable opinions have invariably predominated. In recent decades, besides the stimulatory effects of caffeine, regular coffee drinking has been linked by epidemiological and clinical studies and meta-analyses to a reduced incidence of degenerative diseases such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, liver diseases, different types of cancer, and stroke. These effects derive mainly from the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the beverage, associated with additional properties, all jointly exerted by several active compounds, including caffeine, chlorogenic acids, quinolactones, and minor phenolic compounds, trigonelline, N-methylpyridinium, nicotinic acid, diterpenes, phytosterols, fibers, and melanoidins, among others. Like many herbal medicines, however, coffee drinking has potential adverse effects involving natural and incidental compounds, including those produced during roasting. These effects can be minimized through the conscious use of pesticides, practices to avoid mold contamination, intelligent roasting, selective brewing methods, and several technological processes. In the same way, the presence of major beneficial compounds can be maximized from field to cup.

Güven, Mesut	Detection of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases Using Deep Learning-Based Various Transformers Models	Engineering Proceedings	EN	Proceeding Paper	Alzheimer; artificial intelligence; deep learning; image classification; Parkinson; transformers	Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition primarily attributed to environmental factors, abnormal protein deposits, immune system dysregulation, and the consequential death of nerve cells in the brain. On the other hand, Parkinson’s disease manifests as a neurological disorder featuring primary motor, secondary motor, and non-motor symptoms, accompanied by the rapid demise of cells in the brain’s dopamine-producing region. Utilizing brain images for accurate diagnosis and treatment is integral to addressing both conditions. This study harnessed the power of artificial intelligence for classification processes, employing state-of-the-art transformer models such as Swin transformer, vision transformer (ViT), and bidirectional encoder representation from image transformers (BEiT). The investigation utilized an open-source dataset comprising 450 images, evenly distributed among healthy, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s classes. The dataset was meticulously divided, with 80% allocated to the training set (390 images) and 20% to the validation set (90 images). Impressively, the classification accuracy surpassed 80%, showcasing the efficacy of transformer-based models in disease detection. Looking ahead, this study recommends delving into hybrid and ensemble models and leveraging the strengths of multiple transformer-based deep learning architectures. Beyond contributing crucial insights at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neurology, this research emphasizes the transformative potential of advanced models for enhancing diagnostic precision and treatment strategies in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. It signifies a significant step towards integrating cutting-edge technology into mainstream medical practices for improved patient outcomes.

While human-centered design (HCD) approaches have been widely applied to service process innovation, the literature lacks a methodology that leverages MDs’ key features to design service processes that meet stakeholders’ needs. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a framework for the HCD of service processes enabled by MDs. The proposed framework mixes and adapts methodological elements from HCD and technology-enabled design approaches and proposes four new tools. The five-phase framework was applied to the design of a new Parkinson’s disease diagnosis and treatment process (PD-DTP) enabled by two wearable MDs for the detection of motor symptoms. The case study lasted five months and involved 42 stakeholders in 21 meetings (interviews, focus groups, etc.). Thanks to the case study, the framework was tested, and a new PD-DTP that could benefit all stakeholders involved was identified. This study provides a framework that, in addition to contributing to theory, could assist MDs developers and healthcare managers in designing service processes that cater to stakeholders’ needs by leveraging MDs’ key features.

This retrospective study focused primarily on the usability and patient acceptability of the innovative pathway. In addition, the secondary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a personalized and multidisciplinary rehabilitation pathway on cognitive function, especially executive functions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 80 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr scores 1–3). Patients were divided into an experimental group (EG), which received the innovative pathway, and a control group (CG), which received traditional therapy. The rehabilitation program included three phases: initial outpatient assessment, a two-month inpatient program, and a telerehabilitation phase in a day hospital (DH) or home environment. Interventions combined traditional therapies with treatments based on robotic and virtual reality. Cognitive assessments (Mini Mental State Examination—MMSE—and frontal assessment battery—FAB), mood (Hamilton Rating Scale—Depression—HRS-D), anxiety (HRS-Anxiety—HRS-A), and goals achievement (GAS) were the primary outcome measures. Results: At baseline, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, gender, education, or test scores. After rehabilitation, EG showed significant improvements in all measures (p < 0.001), particularly in cognitive tests and goal achievement. CG improved in GAS (p < 0.001) and mood (HRS-D, p = 0.0012), but less than EG. No significant changes were observed in the MMSE of CG (p = 0.23) or FAB (p = 0.003). Conclusions: This study highlights the high usability and acceptability of VR and robotics in PD rehabilitation, contributing to improved adherence and patient engagement. The experimental group showed greater cognitive benefits, particularly in executive functions. These results are in line with the existing literature on personalized technology-based rehabilitation strategies for PD.

We used proximity elongation assay (PEA) to analyze 460 proteins in serum samples from 46 PD, 30 PSP patients, and 24 healthy controls. ANCOVA was used to identify the most promising proteins and machine learning (ML) XGBoost and random forest algorithms to assess their classification performance. Promising proteins were also quantified by ELISA. Moreover, correlations between serum biomarkers and biological and clinical features were investigated. We identified five proteins (TFF3, CPB1, OPG, CNTN1, TIMP4) showing different levels between PSP and PD, which achieved good performance (AUC: 0.892) when combined by ML. On the other hand, when the three most significant biomarkers (TFF3, CPB1 and OPG) were analyzed by ELISA, there was no difference between groups. Serum levels of TFF3 positively correlated with age in all subjects’ groups, while for OPG and CPB1 such a correlation occurred in PSP patients only. Moreover, CPB1 positively correlated with disease severity in PD, while no correlations were observed in the PSP group. Overall, we identified CPB1 correlating with PD severity, which may support clinical staging of PD. In addition, our results showing discrepancy between PEA and ELISA technology suggest that caution should be used when translating proteomic findings into clinical practice.

Recent advances in wearable technologies and computing resources have shown great potential for the assessment of PD-related symptoms. However, the potential applications (e.g., early diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring) and key features of digital biomarkers for motor symptoms of PD (DB-MS-PD) have not been comprehensively studied. This study aims to provide a state-of-the-art review of current digital biomarker definitions for PD, focusing on the use of wearable devices. This review systematically examines research articles from 2012 to 2024, focusing on key features and recent technologies in PD research. A total of 22 studies were included and thoroughly analyzed. Results indicate that DB-MS-PD can accurately distinguish patients with PD (PwPD) from healthy controls (HC), assess disease severity or treatment response, and detect motor symptoms. Large sample sizes, proper validation, non-invasive devices, and ecological monitoring make DB-MS-PD promising for improving PD management. Challenges include sample and method heterogeneity and lack of public datasets. Future studies can leverage evidence of the current literature to provide more effective and ready-to-use digital tools for monitoring PD.

Mitroshina, Elena; Kalinina, Elizaveta; Kalyakulina, Alena; Teplyakova, Alexandra; Vedunova, Maria	The Effect of the Optogenetic Stimulation of Astrocytes on Neural Network Activity in an In Vitro Model of Alzheimer’s Disease	International Journal of Molecular Sciences	EN	Article	Alzheimer’s disease; amyloidosis; astrocyte; neuronal network activity; optogenetic; multielectrode arrays	Optogenetics is a combination of optical and genetic technologies used to activate or, conversely, inhibit specific cells in living tissues. The possibilities of using optogenetics approaches for the treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are being actively researched. In recent years, it has become clear that one of the most important players in the development of AD is astrocytes. Astrocytes affect amyloid clearance, participate in the development of neuroinflammation, and regulate the functioning of neural networks. We used an adeno-associated virus carrying the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter driving the optogenetic channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) gene to transduce astrocytes in primary mouse hippocampal cultures. We recorded the bioelectrical activity of neural networks from day 14 to day 21 of cultivation using multielectrode arrays. A single optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes at 14 day of cultivation (DIV14) did not cause significant changes in neural network bioelectrical activity. Chronic optogenetic stimulation from DIV14 to DIV21 exerts a stimulatory effect on the bioelectrical activity of primary hippocampal cultures (the proportion of spikes included in network bursts significantly increased since DIV19). Moreover, chronic optogenetic stimulation over seven days partially preserved the activity and functional architecture of neuronal network in amyloidosis modeling. These results suggest that the selective optogenetic activation of astrocytes may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for combating AD.

New technological advances have increased the odds of achieving genetic diagnoses: next-generation sequencing (NGS) (whole-exome sequencing—WES; whole-genome sequencing—WGS) and long-read sequencing (LRS). In 2017, we launched a WES program for patients with rare movement disorders of suspected genetic etiology. We aim to describe the accumulated experience of a modern movement disorder genetic clinic, highlighting how different available genetic tests might be prioritized according to the clinical phenotype and pattern of inheritance. Methods: Participants were studied through WES analysis. Descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, counts, and percentages, were used to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics in all subjects and with each type of result [pathogenic or likely pathogenic, variants of uncertain significance (VUS), negative]. Results: We studied 88 patients (93.2% Caucasian, 5.72% African American, and 1.08% Hispanic or Latino). After excluding six family members from four index participants, the diagnostic yield of WES reached 27% (22/82 probands). The age at onset was significantly lower in patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants. The most common clinical phenotypes were ataxia and parkinsonism. Dystonia, ataxia, leukoencephalopathy, and parkinsonism were associated with most genetic diagnoses. Conclusions: We propose a comprehensive protocol with decision tree testing for WGS and LRS, a return of results, and a re-analysis of inconclusive genetic data to increase the diagnostic yield of patients with rare neurogenetic disorders.

Ben Hadj-Alouane, Nejib; Dhoot, Arav; Turki-Hadj Alouane, Monia; Pangracious, Vinod	Severity Classification of Parkinson’s Disease via Synthesis of Energy Skeleton Images from Videos Produced in Uncontrolled Environments	Diagnostics	EN	Article	Parkinson’s diagnosis; classification; CNN; ViT; ResNets; Skeleton Energy Image (SEI)	Background/Objectives: Parkinson’s Disease is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions worldwide, primarily marked by motor and non-motor symptoms due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. Despite the absence of a cure, current treatments focus on symptom management, often relying on pharmacotherapy and surgical interventions. Early diagnosis remains a critical challenge, particularly in underserved areas, as existing diagnostic protocols lack standardization and accessibility. This paper proposes a novel framework for the diagnosis and severity classification of PD using video data captured in uncontrolled environments. Methods: Leveraging deep learning techniques, our approach synthesizes Skeleton Energy Images (SEIs) from gait sequences and employs three advanced models—a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a Residual Network (ResNet), and a Vision Transformer (ViT)—to analyze these images. Our methodology allows for the accurate detection of PD and differentiation of its severity without requiring specialized equipment or professional oversight. The dataset used consists of labeled videos capturing the early stages of the disease, facilitating the potential for timely intervention. Results: The four models performed very accurately during the training phase. In fact, an accuracy higher than 99% was achieved by the ViT and ResNet models. Moreover, a lesser accuracy of 90% was achieved by the CNN five-layer model. During the test phase, only the best-performing models from the training experiments were tested. The ResNet-18 model has achieved a 100% accuracy. However, the ViT and the CNN five-layer models have achieved, respectively, 99.96% and 96.40% test accuracy. Conclusions: The results demonstrate high accuracy, highlighting the framework’s capabilities, and in particular the effectiveness of the workflow used for generating the SEI images. Given the nature of the dataset used, the proposed framework stands to function as a cost-effective and accessible tool for early PD detection in various healthcare settings. This study contributes to the advancement of mobile health technologies, aiming to enhance early diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease.

It is a combination of technologies, such as 3D printing injection of polymers and silicones at high and low temperatures, used to develop a manufacturing process of a DBS electrode prototype. For the manufacturing process of the DBS electrode, two case studies are proposed, one at high temperature and the other at room temperature. Rings are used for communication at the ends with the deep brain stimulation (DBS). For the development, different types of molds and nozzles were proposed, considering various variables to control the material flow since polymers or copolymers melted at high temperatures behave differently from silicones injected at room temperature. The injection of Polyamide as a coating for a silver core in a mold, as well as the injection of silicone over a steel core, have been applied theoretically and experimentally. The results show a new method and technique to produce DBS electrodes at a low cost.

While traditionally viewed as primarily neuronal disorders, recent research has highlighted the crucial roles of neuroglia-astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases. This review explores the dual nature of glial cells in neurodegenerative processes, focusing on their protective and potentially harmful functions in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative disorders. We examine the complex interactions between different glial cell types and neurons, highlighting recent discoveries in glial-neuronal metabolic coupling, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation. Advanced technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, have revealed unprecedented glial heterogeneity and disease-specific glial states, reshaping our understanding of these cells’ roles in health and disease. The review also discusses emerging concepts in neuroglial research, including the role of extracellular vesicles in disease propagation, epigenetic regulation of glial function, and the application of artificial intelligence in glial biology. Finally, we explore the therapeutic implications of targeting glia in neurodegenerative diseases, addressing both the promising avenues and challenges in developing glial-focused interventions. By integrating recent advances in neuroglial research, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the field and highlights future directions for research and therapeutic development.

However, as the disease advances, the therapeutic window for levodopa narrows, leading to motor complications like fluctuations and dyskinesias. Clinicians face challenges in optimizing daily therapeutic regimens, particularly in advanced stages, due to the lack of quantitative biomarkers for continuous motor monitoring. Biochemical sensing of levodopa offers a promising approach for real-time therapeutic feedback, potentially sustaining an optimal motor state throughout the day. These sensors vary in invasiveness, encompassing techniques like microdialysis, electrochemical non-enzymatic sensing, and enzymatic approaches. Electrochemical sensing, including wearable solutions that utilize reverse iontophoresis and microneedles, is notable for its potential in non-invasive or minimally invasive monitoring. Point-of-care devices and standard electrochemical cells demonstrate superior performance compared to wearable solutions; however, this comes at the cost of wearability. As a result, they are better suited for clinical use. The integration of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes, metal–organic frameworks, and graphene has significantly enhanced sensor sensitivity, selectivity, and detection performance. This framework paves the way for accurate, continuous monitoring of levodopa and its metabolites in biofluids such as sweat and interstitial fluid, aiding real-time motor performance assessment in Parkinson’s disease. This review highlights recent advancements in biochemical sensing for levodopa and catecholamine monitoring, exploring emerging technologies and their potential role in developing closed-loop therapy for Parkinson’s disease.

This innovative microfluidic cell culture device was created using a microchip with continuously perfused chambers, populated by living cells arranged to replicate physiological processes at the tissue and organ levels. By consolidating multicellular structures, tissue–tissue interfaces, and physicochemical microenvironments, these microchips can replicate key organ functions. They also enable the high-resolution, real-time imaging and analysis of the biochemical, genetic, and metabolic activities of living cells in the functional tissue and organ contexts. This technology can accelerate research into tissue development, organ physiology and disease etiology, therapeutic approaches, and drug testing. It enables the replication of entire organ functions (e.g., liver-on-a-chip, hypothalamus–pituitary-on-a-chip) or the creation of disease models (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-on-a-chip, Parkinson’s disease-on-a-chip) using specialized microchips and combining them into an integrated functional system. This technology allows for a significant reduction in the number of animals used in experiments, high reproducibility of results, and the possibility of simultaneous use of multiple cell types in a single model.

These disorders are difficult to manage due to the complexity of disease mechanisms and the protective blood–brain barrier (BBB), which restricts drug delivery. Recent advancements in nanoparticle (NP) technologies offer promising solutions, with potential applications in drug delivery, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. By examining current research, we explore how NPs can cross the BBB, deliver medications directly to targeted CNS regions, and enhance both diagnostics and treatment. Key NP strategies, such as passive targeting, receptor-mediated transport, and stimuli-responsive systems, demonstrate encouraging results. Studies show that NPs may improve drug delivery, minimize side effects, and increase therapeutic effectiveness in models of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, and glioblastoma. NP technologies thus represent a promising approach for CNS disorder management, combining drug delivery and diagnostic capabilities to enable more precise and effective treatments that could significantly benefit patient outcomes.

These include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques—Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging—in identifying subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense.

This narrative review explores the emerging subject of digital eye-movement outcomes (DEMOs) and their potential as sensitive biomarkers for neurological impairment. Eye tracking has become a useful method for investigating visual system functioning, attentional processes, and cognitive mechanisms. Abnormalities in eye movements, such as altered saccadic patterns or impaired smooth pursuit, can act as important diagnostic indicators for various neurological conditions. The non-invasive nature, cost-effectiveness, and ease of implementation of modern eye-tracking systems makes it particularly attractive in both clinical and research settings. Advanced digital eye-tracking technologies and analytical methods enable precise quantification of eye-movement parameters, complementing subjective clinical evaluations with objective data. This review examines how DEMOs could contribute to the localisation and diagnosis of neural impairments, potentially serving as useful biomarkers. By comprehensively exploring the role of eye-movement assessment, this review aims to highlight the common eye-movement deficits seen in neurological injury and disease by using the examples of mild traumatic brain injury and Parkinson’s Disease. This review also aims to enhance the understanding of the potential use of DEMOs in diagnosis, monitoring, and management of neurological disorders, ultimately improving patient care and deepening our understanding of complex neurological processes. Furthermore, we consider the broader implications of this technology in unravelling the complexities of visual processing, attention mechanisms, and cognitive functions.

To address the socio-economic burden that is amplified by the rapidly increasing elderly population, traditional rehabilitation techniques have recently been complemented by technological advancements, particularly Robot-Assisted Therapy (RAT). RAT enhances motor learning by improving both accuracy and consistency. This study proposes an innovative rehabilitation system that combines serious gaming and augmented reality (AR) with the LegUp parallel robot, developed for the spatial rehabilitation of the hip, knee, and ankle in bed-ridden patients. The system aims to improve patient outcomes and actively involve patients in their therapy. Electro-goniometers and a HoloLens 2 device are used to provide immediate feedback about the position of the patient’s joints, forming the basis of an interactive game in which the patient moves their leg to reach various targets. Two game modes were developed, each targeting different aspects of neuromotor rehabilitation, such as coordination, strength, and flexibility. Preliminary findings suggest that combining RAT with augmented reality-based serious gaming can increase patient motivation and engagement. Furthermore, the personalized and interactive nature of the therapy holds the potential to improve rehabilitation outcomes by fostering sustained engagement and effort.

Pradeep Reddy, Gogulamudi; Rohan, Duppala; Kumar, Yellapragada; Prakash, Kasaraneni; Srikanth, Mandarapu	Artificial Intelligence-Based Effective Detection of Parkinson’s Disease Using Voice Measurements	Engineering Proceedings	EN	Proceeding Paper	Parkinson’s disease (PD); artificial intelligence (AI); machine learning (ML); classifiers; effective detection; voice measurements	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative illness that affects the central nervous system and leads to a gradual degeneration of neurons that results in movement slowness, mental health problems, speaking difficulties, etc. In the past 20 years, the frequency of PD has doubled. Global estimates revealed that over 8.5 million cases have been identified so far. Thus, early and accurate detection of PD is crucial for treatment. Traditional detection methods are subjective and prone to delays, as they are reliant on clinical evaluation and imaging. Alternatively, artificial intelligence (AI) has recently emerged as a transformative technology in the healthcare sector, showing decent and promising results. However, an effective algorithm needs to be investigated for the most accurate prediction of a particular disease. Thus, this paper explores the ability of different machine learning algorithms in regard to the effective detection of PD. A total of 26 algorithms were implemented using the Scikit-Learn library on the Oxford PD detection dataset. This is a collection of 195 voice measurements recorded from 31 individuals, of which 23 have PD. The implemented algorithms are logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, support vector machine, Gaussian naïve bayes, multi-layered perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting, adaptive boosting, stochastic gradient descent, gradient boosting machine, extra tree classifier, light gradient boosting machine, categorical boosting, Bernoulli naïve bayes, complement naïve bayes, multinomial naïve bayes, histogram-based gradient boosting, nearest centroid, radius neighbors classifier, logistic regression with elastic net regularization, extreme learning machine, ridge classifier, huber classifier, perceptron classifier, and voting classifier. Among them, MLP outperformed the other algorithms with a testing accuracy of 95%, precision of 94%, sensitivity of 100%, F1 score of 97%, and AUC of 98%. Thus, it successfully discriminates healthy individuals from those with PD, thereby helping for accurate early detection of PD for new patients using their voice measurements.

This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the application of brain stimulation techniques, including non-invasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), as well as invasive approaches like deep brain stimulation (DBS). We explore the efficacy and safety profiles of these techniques in alleviating both motor impairments, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline, depression, and impulse control disorders. Current findings indicate that while non-invasive techniques present a favorable safety profile and are effective for milder symptoms, invasive methods like DBS provide significant relief for severe cases that are unresponsive to other treatments. Future research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters, establish robust clinical protocols, and expand the application of these technologies across various stages of PD. This review underscores the potential of brain stimulation as a vital therapeutic tool in managing PD, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.

A wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms characterizes them. It is evident that in the modern era, the use of smart wrist devices, such as smartwatches, wristbands, and smart bracelets is spreading among all categories of people. This diffusion is justified by the limited costs, ease of use, and less invasiveness (and consequently greater acceptability) than other types of sensors used for health status monitoring. This systematic review aims to synthesize research studies using smart wrist devices for a specific class of movement disorders. Following PRISMA-S guidelines, 130 studies were selected and analyzed. For each selected study, information is provided relating to the smartwatch/wristband/bracelet model used (whether it is commercial or not), the number of end-users involved in the experimentation stage, and finally the characteristics of the benchmark dataset possibly used for testing. Moreover, some articles also reported the type of raw data extracted from the smart wrist device, the implemented designed algorithmic pipeline, and the data classification methodology. It turned out that most of the studies have been published in the last ten years, showing a growing interest in the scientific community. The selected articles mainly investigate the relationship between smart wrist devices and Parkinson’s disease. Epilepsy and seizure detection are also research topics of interest, while there are few papers analyzing gait disorders, Huntington’s Disease, ataxia, or Tourette Syndrome. However, the results of this review highlight the difficulties still present in the use of the smartwatch/wristband/bracelet for the identified categories of movement disorders, despite the advantages these technologies could bring in the dissemination of low-cost solutions usable directly within living environments and without the need for caregivers or medical personnel.

This study aims to explore the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of CP against PD-based on metabolomics technology and provide a theoretical basis for developing new anti-PD medicine. First, MPP+-induced SH-SY5Y cells were used to evaluate the anti-PD activity of CP. In the animal study, an MPTP-induced PD mouse model was employed to assess CP’s therapeutic effects. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining and Western blotting (WB) were used to evaluate its neuroprotective activity on neurons. A Serum metabolomics analysis was conducted to examine CP’s regulatory effects on metabolites and to identify vital metabolic pathways. Finally, cellular experiments were performed to validate the critical pathways. Cellular activity experiments demonstrated that CP mitigates MPP+-induced SH-SY5Y cytotoxicity, inhibits apoptosis, and restores mitochondrial homeostasis. Animal experiments revealed that CP significantly alleviates dyskinesia in PD mice, enhances motor performance, and restores neuronal integrity while reducing α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation in the striatum (STR), showing its strong anti-PD effect. Metabolomic analysis revealed that CP can significantly improve the metabolic disorders of ten biomarkers that are mainly involved in amino acid metabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation and are closely related to oxidative stress pathways. Finally, pathway verification was performed, and the results show that CP exerted neuroprotective effects against PD through the dual signaling pathways of Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase-3 and Nrf2/HO-1. This study provides a comprehensive strategy for elucidating the mechanisms by which CP exerts its therapeutic effects against PD, highlighting its potential in developing anti-PD drugs.

Stroke remains the third leading cause of death worldwide and significantly impacts patients’ hand functionality, making hand rehabilitation crucial for improving quality of life. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted analyzing over 300 papers, and categorizing them based on mechanical design, mobility, and actuation systems. To evaluate each device, a database with 45 distinct criteria was developed to systematically assess their characteristics. Results: The analysis revealed three main categories of devices: rigid exoskeletons, soft exoskeletons, and hybrid devices. Electric actuation represents the most common source of power. The dorsal placement of the mechanism is predominant, followed by glove-based, lateral, and palmar configurations. A correlation between mass and functionality was observed during the analysis; an increase in the number of actuated fingers or in functionality automatically increases the mass of the device. The research shows significant technological evolution with considerable variation in design complexity, with 29.4% of devices using five or more actuators while 24.8% employ one or two actuators. Conclusions: While substantial progress has been made in recent years, several challenges persist, including missing information or incomplete data from source papers and a limited number of clinical studies to evaluate device effectiveness. Significant opportunities remain to improve device functionality, usability, and therapeutic effectiveness, as well as to implement advanced power systems for portable devices.

DBS uses high-frequency stimulation with spatially distributed electrodes to produce electrical fields that influence neuronal networks. The programming of such stimulation is complex and time-consuming. Recent technological advancements have enabled DBS systems to record local field potentials (LFPs). In conjunction with biomarker discovery, such as beta oscillations, this shows promise in streamlining the DBS programming process. This review aims to synthesize the current literature investigating LFP characteristics in PD in order to understand the place of LFPs in assisting with DBS programming. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using databases including OVID MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, resulting in 738 identified articles; 122 studies remained after screening and 87 studies were selected for detailed analysis. Results: Analyzing LFPs clearly has the potential to assist or streamline DBS programming in clinical practice, but there are knowledge gaps and challenges to overcome, especially in the utilization of intraoperative LFPs. Conclusions: More research is required to compare different algorithms that utilize LFPs in DBS programming to identify a simple, practical and time-saving algorithm incorporating reliable LFP biomarkers that will enhance the DBS programming experience for both patients and clinicians.

These sensors can provide continuous and real-time monitoring of various motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, allowing for early detection and intervention. In this paper, I review current research on the application of wearable sensors in PD, focusing on gait, tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia monitoring.(2) Methods: this involved a literature search that spanned the 2000–2024 period and included the following keywords: “wearable sensors”, “Parkinson’s Disease”, “Inertial sensors”, “accelerometers’’, ‘’gyroscopes’’, ‘’magnetometers”, “Smartphones”, and “Smart homes”. (3) Results: Despite favorable outcomes from the early development of inertial sensors, like gyroscopes and accelerometers in smartphones, the application of wearable sensors is still restricted because there are no standards, harmonization, or consensus for both clinical and analytical validation. As a result, several clinical trials were created to compare the effectiveness of wearable sensors with conventional evaluation methods in order to track the course of the disease and enhance the quality of life and results.

Keba, Martin; Bachmann, Maie; Lass, Jaanus; Rätsep, Tõnu	Assessing Parkinson’s Rest Tremor from the Wrist with Accelerometry and Gyroscope Signals in Patients with Deep Brain Stimulation: An Observational Study	Journal of Clinical Medicine	EN	Article	wearable device; tremor; accelerometry; gyroscope; inertial measurement unit; Parkinson’s disease; deep brain stimulation; tremor rating scale	Background: Wearable sensors are mainly used in Parkinson’s disease (PD) to assess motor symptoms and to aid clinicians in patient management. Inertial measurement units that simultaneously register accelerometric and gyroscope signals have been one of the most studied and practicable methods. The heterogeneity of described methods and clinical settings studied can discourage wearable device use and highlight the need for standardization. This study compares previously proposed accelerometry and gyroscope signal features for tremor assessment measured at the wrist. Methods: An inertial measurement unit registered accelerometry and gyroscope signals at the wrist from 18 PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Measurements were made in DBS on and off states. Signal features for both accelerometry and gyroscope were calculated—mean linear acceleration, mean angular velocity, root mean square, maximal amplitude and power of the 3–7 Hz frequency band. The outcome features were log-transformed and correlated to the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) item 3.17 using linear regression. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values were calculated for the signal features. Results: A total of 108 tremor episodes were investigated. All signal features exhibited a strong correlation with the MDS-UPDRS tremor amplitude scale. Tremor ratings showed a stronger correlation with accelerometry (r = 0.964–0.970) than with gyroscope-derived features (r = 0.942–0.956). The best-performing feature was the mean linear acceleration (r = 0.970, R2 = 0.940), which also showed high reliability (ICC = 0.921). Conclusions: Different accelerometry and gyroscope signal features are viable in characterizing rest tremor at the wrist. Simpler accelerometry signal features can be preferred in conducting the MDS-UPDRS item 3.17 examination in PD patients with DBS using a wrist-worn inertial measurement unit. Future research to expand the validity and usefulness of wearable technologies in PD is warranted.

Matos, Joana; Ramos, Beatriz; Fernandes, Joana; Hansen, Clint; Maetzler, Walter; Vila-Chã, Nuno; Maia, Luís	Wearable Sensors for Sleep Monitoring in Free-Living Environments: A Scoping Review on Parkinson’s Disease	Biosensors	EN	Review	wearables; Parkinson’s disease; sleep–wake disorders; ambulatory; machine learning; sleep; actigraphy	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects multiple neural pathways, leading to a broad spectrum of motor and non-motor symptoms. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, are prevalent among PD patients and significantly impact symptomatology and patients’ quality of life. Wearable technology presents an opportunity to study these interactions in patients’ daily life environments without the limitations of in-clinic sleep studies. Thus, this review aims to explore how wearable technology has been employed or developed for the sleep monitoring of PD patients in free-living environments. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore to identify original research articles focusing on wearable sleep technology for the ambulatory monitoring of PD patients. Twenty-six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and underwent structured data extraction and quality assessment. Key aspects analysed included subject demographics, extracted sleep parameters, identified sleep disorders, and the application of machine-learning algorithms. Wearable devices could offer a practical solution for long-term sleep monitoring in PD, though further validation is needed. The absence of standardised protocols and the lack of device validation within PD populations remain significant challenges. The evidence gathered in this study remains insufficient to define a standardised protocol for sleep assessment of PD patients in free-living environments.

Eye movement abnormalities are increasingly recognized as early biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease (PD), reflecting both motor and cognitive dysfunction. Advances in eye-tracking technology provide objective, quantifiable measures of saccadic impairments, fixation instability, smooth pursuit deficits, and pupillary changes. These advances offer new opportunities for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and neurorehabilitation. (2) Objective. This narrative review explores the relationship between oculomotor dysfunction and PD pathophysiology, highlighting the potential applications of eye tracking in clinical and research settings. (3) Methods. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, focusing on peer-reviewed studies examining eye movement dysfunction in PD. Relevant publications were identified through PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, using key terms, such as “eye movements in Parkinson’s disease”, “saccadic control and neurodegeneration”, “fixation instability in PD”, and “eye-tracking for cognitive assessment”. Studies integrating machine learning (ML) models and VR-based interventions were also included. (4) Results. Patients with PD exhibit distinct saccadic abnormalities, including hypometric saccades, prolonged saccadic latency, and increased anti-saccade errors. These impairments correlate with executive dysfunction and disease progression. Fixation instability and altered pupillary responses further support the role of oculomotor metrics as non-invasive biomarkers. Emerging AI-driven eye-tracking models show promise for automated PD diagnosis and progression tracking. (5) Conclusions. Eye tracking provides a reliable, cost-effective tool for early PD detection, cognitive assessment, and rehabilitation. Future research should focus on standardizing clinical protocols, validating predictive AI models, and integrating eye tracking into multimodal treatment strategies.

Paipa-Jabre-Cantu, Samir; Rodriguez-Salvador, Marisela; Castillo-Valdez, Pedro	Revealing Three-Dimensional Printing Technology Advances for Oral Drug Delivery: Application to Central-Nervous-System-Related Diseases	Pharmaceutics	EN	Review	3D printing; oral drug delivery; central nervous system	Background/Objectives. Central nervous system (CNS)-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD), stroke, epilepsy, and migraines are leading causes of morbidity and disability worldwide. New solutions for drug delivery are increasingly needed. In this context, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has introduced innovative alternatives to produce more efficient medicines with diverse features, patterns, and consistencies, particularly oral medications. Even though research in this area is growing rapidly, no study has thoroughly analyzed 3D printing oral drug delivery progress for the CNS. To fill this gap this study pursues to determine a technological landscape in this field. Methods. For this aim, a Competitive Technology Intelligence (CTI) methodology was applied, examining 747 publications from 1 January 2019 to 20 May 2024 published in the Scopus database. Results. The main advances identified comprise six categories: 3D printing techniques, characteristics and applications, materials, design factors, user acceptance, and quality processes. FDM was identified as the main technique for pharmaceutical use. The main applications include pills, polypills, caplets, gel caps, multitablets, orodispersible films, and tablets, featuring external patterns and internal structures with one or more active substances. Insights show that the most utilized materials are thermoplastic polymers like PLA, PVA, PCL, ABS, and HIPS. A novel design factor involves release patterns using compartments of varying thicknesses and volumes in the core. Additionally, advances in specialized software have enabled the creation of highly complex designs. In the user acceptance category, oral drugs dosages are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of neurological patients. Finally, for the quality aspect, the precision in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) dosage and controlled-release mechanisms are critical, given the narrow margin between therapeutic doses and toxicity for CNS diseases. Conclusions. Revealing these advancements in 3D printing for oral drug delivery allows researchers, academics, and decision-makers to identify opportunities and allocate resources efficiently, promising enhanced oral medicaments for the health and well-being of individuals suffering from CNS disorders.

While predominantly affecting individuals in their fifth or sixth decade, advancements in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have created new clinical scenarios involving pregnancies in women within MSA’s typical onset range. Given the scarcity of documented MSA pregnancies, this review leverages insights from related Parkinson’s spectrum mechanisms to explore hypothetical scenarios for how pregnancy-induced physiological changes might influence MSA progression. Pregnancy-induced hormonal fluctuations, including elevated estrogen and progesterone levels, may modulate α-synuclein aggregation and neuroinflammatory pathways. Immune adaptations, such as fetal microchimerism and Th2-biased immune profiles, introduce additional complexities, particularly in donor embryo pregnancies involving complex microchimerism. Metabolic demands and oxidative stress further intersect with these mechanisms, potentially accelerating disease progression. We analyze existing literature and theoretical models, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary research. Clinical implications are discussed to propose evidence-based strategies for optimizing maternal-fetal outcomes. This paper identifies critical knowledge gaps and proposes avenues for future investigation to optimize maternal-fetal outcomes in this unique and underexplored clinical intersection.	“Genesis” Hospital, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia	10.3390/ijms26073348	2025	26	7	-	-	3348	-

This systematic review aimed to identify gaps in the current literature, with a focus on methodologies and tools for evaluating such needs, particularly those based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) framework. Methods: A systematic review of qualitative studies published between 2021 and 2023 was conducted, updating a previous (2020) review. Studies were identified through PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using inclusion criteria focused on qualitative methods capturing patients’ experiences with robotic and technological rehabilitation devices. Results: The review analyzed 19 new studies and 20 from the prior review, revealing a reliance on semi-structured interviews targeting small, heterogeneous populations. No studies employed standardized ICF-based tools, and gaps were noted in the exploration of conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, frailty, or conditions that allowed for multi-device experiences. Conclusions: The findings emphasize the necessity for tailored surveys grounded in the ICF framework to completely evaluate the needs of patients suffering from sensory, motor, and/or cognitive disorders caused by different health conditions.

Dudek, Milosz; Hemmerling, Daria; Kaczmarska, Marta; Stepien, Joanna; Daniol, Mateusz; Wodzinski, Marek; Wojcik-Pedziwiatr, Magdalena	Analysis of Voice, Speech, and Language Biomarkers of Parkinson’s Disease Collected in a Mixed Reality Setting	Sensors	EN	Article	explainable artificial intelligence; large language models; mixed reality; Parkinson’s disease; voice biomarkers; remote patient monitoring	This study explores an innovative approach to early Parkinson’s disease (PD) detection by analyzing speech data collected using a mixed reality (MR) system. A total of 57 Polish participants, including PD patients and healthy controls, performed five speech tasks while using an MR head-mounted display (HMD). Speech data were recorded and analyzed to extract acoustic and linguistic features, which were then evaluated using machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, AdaBoost, and XGBoost. The XGBoost model achieved the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.90 ± 0.05 in the story-retelling task. Key features such as MFCCs (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), spectral characteristics, RASTA-filtered auditory spectrum, and local shimmer were identified as significant in detecting PD-related speech alterations. Additionally, state-of-the-art deep learning models (wav2vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM) were fine-tuned for PD detection. HuBERT achieved the highest performance, with an F1-score of 0.94 ± 0.04 in the diadochokinetic task, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to capture complex speech patterns linked to neurodegenerative diseases. This study highlights the effectiveness of combining MR technology for speech data collection with advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, offering a non-invasive and high-precision approach to PD diagnosis. The findings hold promise for broader clinical applications, advancing the diagnostic landscape for neurodegenerative disorders.

Xiromerisiou, Georgia; Boura, Iro; Barmpounaki, Eleni; Georgoulias, Panagiotis; Dardiotis, Efthimios; Spanaki, Cleanthe; Valotassiou, Varvara	The Utilization and Impact of Dopamine Transporter Imaging in Diagnosing Movement Disorders at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Greece	Biomedicines	EN	Article	movement disorders; dopaminergic imaging; DaTscan; Parkinson’s disease; tremor	Background/Objectives: The introduction of dopamine transporter scan (DaTscan) in clinical diagnostics has revolutionized the way clinicians approach movement disorders, offering valuable insights into presynaptic striatal dopaminergic deficits and revealing subjacent neurodegeneration. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of DaTscan on diagnostic decisions regarding movement disorders, particularly Parkinson’s disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes, under real-world circumstances in Greece. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 360 patients who underwent a DaTscan examination between 2018 and 2023 at a tertiary hospital in Greece, including referrals from both movement disorder specialists and general neurologists, either hospital-based or in private practice. Demographics, primary referral symptoms, and both pre-scan and post-scan diagnoses were collected and analyzed. Results: The mean age in our cohort was 60 ± 13.5 years, and tremor was the leading referral symptom (40.8%). The initial diagnosis changed in nearly half of the cases (48.3%) following DaTscan. Significant shifts included transitions from an “Unclear” or “Dystonia” diagnosis to “Parkinson’s disease” in 78.1% and 72.7% of patients, respectively. However, the particularly high concordance rates between pre-scan and post-scan diagnosis for “Vascular parkinsonism” (100%), “Parkinson’s disease” (89.3%), and “Essential/Dystonic Tremor” (86%) suggest that the test may have been over-utilized or ordered beyond its intended indications. Conclusions: DaTscan markedly enhances diagnostic accuracy for movement disorders, particularly for general neurologists, addressing the complexities of overlapping clinical presentations. Continuous medical training is essential to ensure the cost-effective utilization of DaTscan in routine clinical practice; ongoing technological advancements will further refine and expand their applications, benefiting both patients and the broader medical community.

Traditional FG detection and monitoring methods using clinical observations and wearable sensors face limitations, such as inflexibility, lack of portability, inaccessibility to individuals, and the inability to provide continuous monitoring in real-life environments. To address these challenges, this experimental study presents the development of a software-defined radio (SDR)-based radio frequency (RF) sensing platform for continuous FG monitoring. Data were collected through multiple experiments involving various physical activities, including FG episodes. The acquired data were processed using advanced signal-processing (ASP) techniques to extract relevant wireless channel state information (WCSI) patterns. The physical activities were classified using machine learning and deep learning models developed on the dataset prepared from the SDR-based RF sensing system. The results demonstrated that the deep learning models outperformed the machine learning models. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) achieved the highest accuracy of 99.7%. This indicates that the developed system has the potential for accurate, real-time monitoring of FG and other PD symptoms. The proposed RF sensing platform using SDR technology and artificial intelligence (AI) offers an intelligent and continuous monitoring solution, addressing the limitations of traditional methods. This system provides portable, continuous detection of FG events, potentially improving patient care, safety, and early intervention.

These diseases are among the heavy burdens on global healthcare systems largely because there is no cure, and current treatments apply almost entirely to controlling symptoms rather than disease progression. Recent advances in 3D printing and bioprinting technologies now open the way to overcome these challenges and form patient-specific models and therapeutical tools closely simulating the complex environment of the human brain. It then further illustrates how this technological integration with the aid of 3D printing, coupled with microfabrication and biosensing technologies, transforms drug-screening platforms as well as develops customization in medicine. For example, one can form highly intricate and multi-materially composed structures to better facilitate one’s study or test into some new therapeutic possibilities using methodologies of stereolithography and selective laser sintering. Moreover, 3D printing allows the creation of organ-on-a-chip models that simulate brain-like conditions, which may help identify specific biomarkers and evaluate new options of therapy. On the other hand, bioprinting methods based on neural cells combined with scaffolds mimicking native tissue dramatically transform regenerative medicine. New pathways in neural tissue development and implantable devices are now being brought forth, which can be tailored to the needs of individual patients. These advances bring not only greater precision in terms of the therapy that can be delivered but also 3D printing of implantable microelectrodes able to determine real-time biomarkers responsible for neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this review highlights the robust impact that might be brought forth on the diagnosis and treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases via 3D printing technologies toward more effective management and personal solutions for healthcare.

These developments have enabled the broader application of iPSCs in neuroscience, improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and advanced the investigation of therapeutic targets and methods. Specifically, optimizations in reprogramming protocols, coupled with improved neuronal differentiation and maturation techniques, have greatly facilitated the generation of iPSC-derived neural cells. The integration of the cerebral organoid technology and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has further propelled the application of iPSCs in neurodegenerative diseases to a new stage. Patient-derived or CRISPR-edited cerebral neurons and organoids now serve as ideal disease models, contributing to our understanding of disease pathophysiology and identifying novel therapeutic targets and candidates.

FUS enables precise targeting of tissues using mechanisms like thermoablation, mechanical disruption, and neuromodulation, minimizing damage to surrounding areas. In movement disorders such as essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, MR-guided FUS thalamotomy has demonstrated substantial tremor reduction and improved quality of life. Psychiatric applications include anterior capsulotomy for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder, with promising symptom relief and minimal cognitive side effects. FUS also facilitates blood-brain barrier opening for drug delivery in neurological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. Musculoskeletal applications highlight its efficacy in managing chronic pain from knee osteoarthritis and lumbar facet joint syndrome through precise thermal ablation. Additionally, FUS has shown potential in neuropathic pain management and peripheral nerve stimulation, offering innovative approaches for amputees and cancer survivors. Cognitive and neuromodulatory research underscores its ability to enhance motor function and interhemispheric cortical balance, benefiting stroke and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation. Despite these conditions frequently leading to various kinds of disabilities, no direct exploration of the possible FUS application in rehabilitation is yet available in the literature. All this considered, this review aims to discuss how FUS could be applied in rehabilitation, exploring the current status of knowledge and highlighting future directions.

These include autonomic dysfunction, cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric disturbances, sleep-related disorders, and sensory deficits. Here, we synthesize current evidence on the anatomical, neurochemical, and network-level mechanisms that drive these symptoms, and we examine how they shape disease progression and clinical heterogeneity. We highlight the limitations of dopamine-centric models and advocate for a framework that treats non-motor symptoms as the disorder’s primary, mechanistically distinct features. We also discuss how emerging technologies—such as multi-omic profiling, artificial intelligence, and network neuroscience—enable earlier identification, stratification of non-motor phenotypes, and the development of precision-based therapeutic strategies. Recognizing non-motor symptoms as central to Parkinson’s disease redefines how the disorder should be diagnosed, studied, and treated.

Valerio, José; Aguirre Vera, Guillermo; Fernandez Gomez, Maria; Zumaeta, Jorge; Alvarez-Pinzon, Andrés	AI-Driven Advances in Parkinson’s Disease Neurosurgery: Enhancing Patient Selection, Trial Efficiency, and Therapeutic Outcomes	Brain Sciences	EN	Review	Parkinson’s disease; artificial intelligence; machine learning; clinical trials; neurodegenerative disorders	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by motor and non-motor dysfunctions that severely compromise patients’ quality of life. While pharmacological treatments provide symptomatic relief in the early stages, advanced PD often requires neurosurgical interventions, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and focused ultrasound (FUS), for effective symptom management. A significant challenge in optimizing these therapeutic strategies is the early identification and recruitment of suitable candidates for clinical trials. This review explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing neurosurgical and neuroscience interventions for PD, highlighting the ways in which AI-driven platforms are transforming clinical trial design and patient selection. Machine learning (ML) algorithms and big data analytics enable precise patient stratification, risk assessment, and outcome prediction, accelerating the development of novel therapeutic approaches. These innovations improve trial efficiency, broaden treatment options, and enhance patient outcomes. However, integrating AI into clinical trial frameworks presents challenges such as data standardization, regulatory hurdles, and the need for extensive validation. Addressing these obstacles will require collaboration among neurosurgeons, neuroscientists, AI specialists, and regulatory bodies to establish ethical and effective guidelines for AI-driven technologies in PD neurosurgical research. This paper emphasizes the transformative potential of AI and technological innovation in shaping the future of PD neurosurgery, ultimately enhancing therapeutic efficacy and patient care.

It enables the simulation of various actions, including activities of daily living, within immersive, safe, and controlled environments. Although numerous studies have examined the efficacy of immersive VR for upper limb motor recovery in patients with various conditions, this review aimed to summarize current evidence, highlight benefits and limitations, and provide directions for future research. The review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Studies involving individuals over 18 years old with stroke, Parkinson’s disease, amputation, or fibromyalgia were included. The findings demonstrate improvements in strength, dexterity, range of motion, and coordination. Additional benefits included enhanced neuroplasticity and pain reduction. Immersive VR-based exercise sessions were often perceived as more enjoyable and engaging, and less complex, than conventional therapy. The technology proved to be safe, adaptable across age groups, and customizable. Furthermore, the integration of immersive VR into telerehabilitation programs improved accessibility for both patients and healthcare providers. However, not all populations may benefit equally from this method due to variability in disease severity and the presence of comorbidities.

In recent years, marine-derived antioxidants have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their unique biological activities and diverse sources. This comprehensive review explores the therapeutic potential of various marine antioxidants in mitigating oxidative stress-associated diseases. Marine organisms are rich in bioactive compounds, such as polysaccharides, polyphenols, carotenoids, peptides, and vitamins, which exhibit potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. These compounds have been shown to effectively inhibit oxidative reactions, repair oxidative damage, and enhance the body’s antioxidant defense mechanisms. For instance, marine polysaccharides and their derivatives can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), protect neurons from oxidative damage, and alleviate inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Similarly, marine unsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have been found to reduce cardiovascular risks by lowering serum triglyceride levels and improving vascular endothelial function. Additionally, marine-derived superoxide dismutase (SOD) plays a crucial role in neutralizing ROS, thereby offering protection against oxidative stress in various diseases. Despite these promising findings, challenges remain in the field, including the need for improved extraction and purification technologies, more comprehensive activity evaluation systems, and further research into the safety and bioavailability of these compounds. This review provides a detailed overview of the current research status, highlighting the types, structural characteristics, antioxidant activities, and mechanisms of action of marine antioxidants. It also identifies key areas for future research and development, aiming to harness the full potential of marine-derived antioxidants in the prevention and treatment of oxidative stress-related diseases.

Passive sensing, a subset of remote monitoring, facilitates unobtrusive, real-time data collection without active user engagement. Leveraging devices such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home sensors, these technologies offer advantages over traditional self-reports and intermittent evaluations by capturing behavioural, physiological, and environmental metrics. This systematic review evaluates the clinical utility of passive sensing technologies used in remote monitoring, with a specific emphasis on their impact on clinical outcomes and feasibility in real-world healthcare settings. A PRISMA-guided search identified 26 studies addressing conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia, cancer, cardiopulmonary disorders, and musculoskeletal issues. Findings demonstrated significant correlations between sensor-derived metrics and clinical assessments, validating their potential as digital biomarkers. These technologies demonstrated feasibility and ecological validity in capturing continuous, real-world health data and offer a unified framework for enhancing patient care through three main applications: monitoring chronic disease progression, detecting acute health deterioration, and supporting therapeutic interventions. For example, these technologies successfully identified gait speed changes in Parkinson’s disease, tracked symptom fluctuations in cancer patients, and provided real-time alerts for acute events such as heart failure decompensation. Challenges included long-term adherence, scalability, data integration, security, and ownership. Future research should prioritise validation across diverse settings, long-term impact assessment, and integration into clinical workflows to maximise their utility.

Disruption in the regulatory systems of the human voice can be analyzed and used as a diagnostic tool, labeling voice as a potential “biomarker”. Conversational artificial intelligence is at the core of voice-powered technologies, enabling intelligent interactions between machines. Due to its richness and availability, voice can be leveraged for predictive analytics and enhanced healthcare insights. Utilizing this idea, we reviewed artificial intelligence (AI) models that have executed vocal analysis and their outcomes. Recordings undergo extraction of useful vocal features to be analyzed by neural networks and machine learning models. Studies reveal machine learning models to be superior to spectral analysis in dynamically combining the huge amount of data of vocal features. Clinical applications of a vocal biomarker exist in neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, psychological disorders, DM, CHF, CAD, aspiration, GERD, and pulmonary diseases, including COVID-19. The primary ethical challenge when incorporating voice as a diagnostic tool is that of privacy and security. To eliminate this, encryption methods exist to convert patient-identifiable vocal data into a more secure, private nature. Advancements in AI have expanded the capabilities and future potential of voice as a digital health solution.

Though digital health technologies (DHTs) are widely used both clinically and in research as outcome measures, there is a lack of consistency applied to these devices and their resulting metrics. This scoping review aims to identify efforts taken to validate wearable DHTs for use in PSP, identify gaps in research, and discuss the steps needed to expand their use and acceptance as primary trial endpoints. Methods: In this scoping review, we conducted a search of the MEDLINE database to examine the use of DHTs as outcome measures in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Results: A total of 17 publications were identified and reviewed. Included articles evaluated the use of DHT to measure lower extremity function/gait, balance, upper extremity function, and speech. Conclusions: Our scoping review highlights the importance of standardization of DHT metrics by thorough assessment of their content validity, reliability, construct validity, responsiveness, and discriminant validity. Efforts must be taken to ensure DHTs capture clinically relevant, patient-centered outcome measures that are comparable to conventional rating scales, that consistently discriminate disease progression. Incorporation of DHTs as clinical trial endpoints has the potential to encourage clinical research and to advance patient care.

Markerless motion capture (MMC) is a promising approach for the integration of biomechanical analysis into clinical practice. The aims of this project were to evaluate a commercially available MMC system, develop and validate a custom MMC data processing algorithm, and evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm in discriminating fine motor performance between PwPD and healthy controls (HCs). Methods: A total of 58 PwPD and 25 HCs completed finger-tapping assessments, administered and recorded by a self-worn augmented reality headset. Fine motor performance was evaluated using the headset’s built-in hand tracking software (Native-MMC) and a custom algorithm (CART-MMC). Outcomes from each were compared against a gold-standard motion capture system (Traditional-MC) to determine the equivalence. Known-group validity was evaluated using CART-MMC. Results: A total of 82 trials were analyzed for equivalence against the Traditional-MC, and 152 trials were analyzed for known-group validity. The CART-MMC outcomes were statistically equivalent to Traditional-MC (within 5%) for tap count, frequency, amplitude, and opening velocity metrics. The Native-MMC did not meet equivalence with the Traditional-MC, deviating by an average of 24% across all outcomes. The CART-MMC captured significant differences between PwPD and HCs for tapping amplitude, amplitude variability, frequency variability, finger opening and closing velocities, and their respective variabilities, and normalized path length. Conclusions: The biomechanical data gathered using a commercially available augmented reality device and analyzed via a custom algorithm accurately characterize fine motor performance in PwPD.

This review synthesizes knowledge of aSyn biology, including its structure, aggregation mechanisms, cellular interactions, and systemic influences. We highlight the structural diversity of aSyn aggregates, ranging from oligomers to fibrils, their strain-like properties, and their prion-like propagation. While the role of prion-like mechanisms in disease progression remains a topic of ongoing debate, these processes may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of synucleinopathies. Dysregulation of protein clearance pathways, including chaperone-mediated autophagy and the ubiquitin–proteasome system, exacerbates aSyn accumulation, while post-translational modifications influence its toxicity and aggregation propensity. Emerging evidence suggests that immune responses and alterations in the gut microbiome are key modulators of aSyn pathology, linking peripheral processes—particularly those of intestinal origin—to central neurodegeneration. Advances in biomarker development, such as cerebrospinal fluid assays, post-translationally modified aSyn, and real-time quaking-induced conversion technology, hold promise for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Furthermore, positron emission tomography imaging and conformation-specific antibodies offer innovative tools for visualising and targeting aSyn pathology in vivo. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in accurately modelling human synucleinopathies, as existing animal and cellular models capture only specific aspects of the disease. This review underscores the need for more reliable aSyn biomarkers to facilitate the development of effective treatments. Achieving this goal requires an interdisciplinary approach integrating genetic, epigenetic, and environmental insights.

These motor disorders significantly affect mobility, quality of life, and well-being. Recently, physical activity of various intensities monitored both remotely and face-to-face via digital health technologies, mobile platforms, or sensory cues has gained relevance in managing idiopathic and atypical Parkinson’s disease (PD and APD). Remote monitoring solutions, including home-based digital health assessments using semi-structured activities, offer unique advantages. Real-world gait parameters like walking speed can now be continuously assessed with body-worn sensors. Developing effective strategies to slow pathological aging and mitigate neurodegenerative progression is essential. This study presents outcomes of using digital health technologies (DHTs) for remote assessment of motor function, physical activity, and daily living tasks, aiming to reduce disease progression in PD and APD. In addition to wearable inertial sensors, clinical rating scales and digital biomarkers enhance the ability to characterize and monitor motor symptoms. By reviewing recent literature, we identified emerging trends in quantifying and intervening in neurodegeneration using tools that evaluate both remote and face-to-face physical activity. Our findings confirm that DHTs offer accurate detection of motor fluctuations and support clinical evaluations. In conclusion, DHTs represent a scalable, effective strategy for improving the clinical management of PD and APD. Their integration into healthcare systems may enhance patient outcomes, support early intervention, and help delay the progression of both motor and cognitive symptoms in aging individuals.

Traditionally, clinical assessments have relied on scales and methods that often lack the ability for continuous, real-time monitoring and can be subject to interpretation bias. Recent advancements in wearable technologies, such as smartphones, smartwatches, and activity trackers (ATs), present a promising alternative for more consistent and objective monitoring. This review aims to evaluate the use of smartphones and smart wrist devices, like smartwatches and activity trackers, in the management of PD, assessing their effectiveness in symptom evaluation and monitoring and physical performance improvement. Studies were identified by searching in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Only 13 studies of 1027 were included in our review. Smartphones, smartwatches, and activity trackers showed a growing potential in the assessment, monitoring, and improvement of motor symptoms in people with PD, compared to clinical scales and research-grade sensors. Their relatively low cost, accessibility, and usability support their integration into real-world clinical practice and exhibit validity to support PD management.

Hassija, Natasha; Hill, Edward; Dawes, Helen; Mayo, Nancy	Comparability of Methods for Remotely Assessing Gait Quality	Sensors	EN	Article	gait analysis; Parkinson’s disease; remote assessment; wearable sensor; pose estimation; observational analysis; digital technology	Advancements in remote gait analysis technologies enable efficient, cost-effective, and personalized real-time assessments at home. This study aims to contribute evidence as to the comparability of gait quality metrics of three methods of remote gait assessment in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD): (1) observation, (2) a wearable sensor, and (3) pose estimation. A cross-sectional, multiple case series study was conducted remotely. Twenty participants submitted videos performing a modified TUG test with the Heel2ToeTM wearable. Each video was analysed by six raters using the checklist specific to PD developed for this study and the MediaPipe Pose Landmarker task estimation library. The observational ratings agreed with the Heel2ToeTM on detecting heel strike 64% of the time and 28.5% of the time on detecting push-off. The difference in the ranks of paired observations based on the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test between the pairs of methods compared was significant for all parameters, except for push-off when estimates from MediaPipe were compared to the ratings from the Observational Checklist, W = 86 (p = 0.498). A combination of digital technologies for remote gait analysis, such as wearable sensors and pose estimation, can detect subtle nuances in gait impairments that may be overlooked by the human eye.

Neumann, Sebastian; Heumann, Rolf	Is the Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel a Major Player in Neurodegenerative Diseases?	International Journal of Molecular Sciences	EN	Review	voltage-dependent anion channels; Alzheimer’s disease; Parkinson’s disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Huntington’s disease	The family of voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) comprises three isoforms (VDAC-1, VDAC-2, VDAC-3). VDACs have been extensively described as localised in the outer mitochondrial membrane where they are involved in the exchange of ions, metabolites, and ATP/ADP between mitochondria and cytosol. The VDAC interacts with disease-specific proteins and thus regulates the mitochondrial function and controls the cellular energy resources, explaining its involvement in cell death and apoptosis. In addition, VDAC-1 and -2 can also be found at other cellular locations such as in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, in the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as in the plasma membrane. Through single-channel pore regulation, oligomerisation, or changed expression levels the VDAC is involved in different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and others. Here, we critically summarise current discussions about the VDAC as a common key player for these diseases. We suggest that the VDAC acts as a transmembrane multifunctional regulatory protein which might serve as a pharmacological target for the development of novel drugs against neurodegenerative diseases such as the application of recombinant antibody technology.

Its understanding and effective treatment is compromised due to the difficulty in reliably triggering FOG in clinical and laboratory environments. The Cleveland Clinic-Virtual Home Environment (CC-VHE) platform was developed to address the challenges of eliciting FOG by combining an omnidirectional treadmill with immersive virtual reality (VR) environments to induce FOG under physical, emotional, and cognitive triggers. Recent developments in deep brain stimulation devices that sense neural signals from the subthalamic nucleus in real time offer the potential to understand the underlying neural mechanism(s) of FOG. This manuscript presents the coupling of the CC-VHE technology, VR paradigms, and the experimental and analytical methods for recording and analyzing synchronous cortical, subcortical, and kinematic data as an approach to begin to understand the nuanced neural pathology associated with FOG. To evaluate the utility and feasibility of coupling VR and neural sensing technology, initial data from one participant are included.

Lamsey, Matthew; Wells, Meredith; Hamby, Lydia; Scanlon, Paige; Siddiqui, Rouida; Tan, You; Feldman, Jerry; Kemp, Charles; Hackney, Madeleine	Exercise Specialists’ Evaluation of Robot-Led Rehabilitative Exercise for People with Parkinson’s Disease	Healthcare	EN	Article	robotics; Parkinson’s disease; assistive device; rehabilitation; technology	Background/Objectives: Robot-led rehabilitative exercise offers a promising avenue to enhance the care provided by exercise specialists (ESs). ESs, such as physical and occupational therapists, prescribe exercise regimens to clinical populations to improve patients’ adherence to prescribed exercises outside the clinic, such as at home. Collaborative efforts among roboticists, clinical ESs, and patients are essential for developing interactive, personalized exercise systems that meet each stakeholder’s needs. This work builds upon research involving individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) that evaluated a robotic rehabilitative exercise system designed to address strength and flexibility deficits. Methods: To complement the findings of our previous work in people with PD (PWP), we conducted a pilot user study in which 11 ESs evaluated a novel robot-led exercise system for PWP, focusing on perceptions of the system’s efficacy and acceptance. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including technology acceptance questionnaires, task load questionnaires, and inductively coded semi-structured interviews, we gathered comprehensive insights into ES perspectives and experiences after interacting with the system. Results: Findings reveal a broadly positive reception, which highlights the system’s capacity to augment traditional rehabilitative exercise for PD, enhance patient engagement, and ensure consistent exercise support. We also identified two key areas for improvement: incorporating more human-like feedback systems and increasing the robot’s ease of use. Conclusion: This research emphasizes the value of incorporating robotic assistants into rehabilitative exercise for PD, offering insights that can guide the development of more effective and user-friendly rehabilitation technologies.

Diotaiuti, Pierluigi; Marotta, Giulio; Vitiello, Salvatore; Di Siena, Francesco; Palombo, Marco; Langiano, Elisa; Ferrara, Maria; Mancone, Stefania	Biofeedback for Motor and Cognitive Rehabilitation in Parkinson’s Disease: A Comprehensive Review of Non-Invasive Interventions	Brain Sciences	EN	Review	biofeedback; Parkinson’s disease; motor rehabilitation; neurofeedback; electromyography; heart rate variability; cognitive Enhancement; non-pharmacological therapy; wearable neurotechnology; autonomic regulation	(1) Background: Biofeedback and neurofeedback are gaining attention as non-invasive rehabilitation strategies in Parkinson’s disease (PD) treatment, aiming to modulate motor and non-motor symptoms through the self-regulation of physiological signals. (2) Objective: This review explores the application of biofeedback techniques, electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback, heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback, and electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback in PD rehabilitation, analyzing their impacts on motor control, autonomic function, and cognitive performance. (3) Methods: This review critically examined 15 studies investigating the efficacy of electromyographic (EMG), heart rate variability (HRV), and electroencephalographic (EEG) feedback interventions in PD. Studies were selected through a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature and analyzed in terms of design, sample characteristics, feedback modality, outcomes, and clinical feasibility. (4) Results: EMG biofeedback demonstrated improvements in muscle activation, gait, postural stability, and dysphagia management. HRV biofeedback showed positive effects on autonomic regulation, emotional control, and cardiovascular stability. EEG neurofeedback targeted abnormal cortical oscillations, such as beta-band overactivity and reduced frontal theta, and was associated with improvements in motor initiation, executive functioning, and cognitive flexibility. However, the reviewed studies were heterogeneous in design and outcome measures, limiting generalizability. Subgroup trends suggested modality-specific benefits across motor, autonomic, and cognitive domains. (5) Conclusions: While EMG and HRV systems are more accessible for clinical or home-based use, EEG neurofeedback remains technically demanding. Standardization of protocols and further randomized controlled trials are needed. Future directions include AI-driven personalization, wearable technologies, and multimodal integration to enhance accessibility and long-term adherence. Biofeedback presents a promising adjunct to conventional PD therapies, supporting personalized, patient-centered rehabilitation models.

Ianculescu, Marilena; Băjenaru, Lidia; Vasilevschi, Ana-Mihaela; Gheorghe-Moisii, Maria; Gheorghe, Cristina-Gabriela	Advancing Neurodegenerative Disease Management: Technical, Ethical, and Regulatory Insights from the NeuroPredict Platform	Future Internet	EN	Article	digital health system; neurodegenerative diseases; multimodal monitoring; artificial intelligence; fall detection; edge-to-cloud architecture; sensor fusion; ethical and regulatory compliance	On a worldwide scale, neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s, face considerable healthcare challenges demanding the development of novel approaches to early detection and efficient treatment. With its ability to provide real-time patient monitoring, customized medical care, and advanced predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming the way healthcare is provided. Through the integration of wearable physiological sensors, motion sensors, and neurological assessment tools, the NeuroPredict platform harnesses AI and smart sensor technologies to enhance the management of specific neurodegenerative diseases. Machine learning algorithms process these data flows to find patterns that point out disease evolution. This paper covers the design and architecture of the NeuroPredict platform, stressing the ethical and regulatory requirements that guide its development. Initial development of AI algorithms for disease monitoring, technical achievements, and constant enhancements driven by early user feedback are addressed in the discussion section. To ascertain the platform’s trustworthiness and data security, it also points towards risk analysis and mitigation approaches. The NeuroPredict platform’s capability for achieving AI-driven smart healthcare solutions is highlighted, even though it is currently in the development stage. Subsequent research is expected to focus on boosting data integration, expanding AI models, and providing regulatory compliance for clinical application. The current results are based on incremental laboratory tests using simulated user roles, with no clinical patient data involved so far. This study reports an experimental technology evaluation of modular components of the NeuroPredict platform, integrating multimodal sensors and machine learning pipelines in a laboratory-based setting, with future co-design and clinical validation foreseen for a later project phase.

Dharavathu, Krishna; Sankula, Pavan; Vullanki, Uma; Mohammad, Subhan; Kesapatnapu, Sai; Shaik, Sameer	Implementation of a Prototype-Based Parkinson’s Disease Detection System Using a RISC-V Processor	Engineering Proceedings	EN	Proceeding Paper	PD; WHO; RISC-V; HMI; DSP; MATLAB	In the wide range of human diseases, Parkinson’s disease (PD) has a high incidence, according to a recent survey by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO records, this chronic disease has affected approximately 10 million people worldwide. Patients who do not receive an early diagnosis may develop an incurable neurological disorder. PD is a degenerative disorder of the brain, characterized by the impairment of the nigrostriatal system. A wide range of symptoms of motor and non-motor impairment accompanies this disorder. By using new technology, the PD is detected through speech signals of the PD victims by using the reduced instruction set computing 5th version (RISC-V) processor. The RISC-V microcontroller unit (MCU) was designed for the voice-controlled human-machine interface (HMI). With the help of signal processing and feature extraction methods, the digital signal is impaired by the impairment of the nigrostriatal system. These speech signals can be classified through classifier modules. A wide range of classifier modules are used to classify the speech signals as normal or abnormal to identify PD. We use Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB R2021a_v9.10.0.1602886) to analyze the data, develop algorithms, create modules, and develop the RISC-V processor for embedded implementation. Machine learning (ML) techniques are also used to extract features such as pitch, tremor, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

Ortega-Robles, Emmanuel; Carino-Escobar, Ruben; Cantillo-Negrete, Jessica; Arias-Carrión, Oscar	Brain–Computer Interfaces in Parkinson’s Disease Rehabilitation	Biomimetics	EN	Review	Parkinson disease; electroencephalography; brain–computer interfaces; neurorehabilitation; wearable electronic devices	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder with motor and non-motor symptoms that are inadequately addressed by current pharmacological and surgical therapies. Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (eBCIs), provide a promising, non-invasive approach to personalized neurorehabilitation. This narrative review explores the clinical potential of BCIs in PD, discussing signal acquisition, processing, and control paradigms. eBCIs are well-suited for PD due to their portability, safety, and real-time feedback capabilities. Emerging neurophysiological biomarkers—such as beta-band synchrony, phase–amplitude coupling, and altered alpha-band activity—may support adaptive therapies, including adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), as well as motor and cognitive interventions. BCIs may also aid in diagnosis and personalized treatment by detecting these cortical and subcortical patterns associated with motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD. A structured search identified 11 studies involving 64 patients with PD who used BCIs for aDBS, neurofeedback, and cognitive rehabilitation, showing improvements in motor function, cognition, and engagement. Clinical translation requires attention to electrode design and user-centered interfaces. Ethical issues, including data privacy and equitable access, remain critical challenges. As wearable technologies and artificial intelligence evolve, BCIs could shift PD care from intermittent interventions to continuous, brain-responsive therapy, potentially improving patients’ quality of life and autonomy. This review highlights BCIs as a transformative tool in PD management, although more robust clinical evidence is needed.

Barber, Daniel; Wijeratne, Tissa; Singh, Lakshman; Barnham, Kevin; Masters, Colin	The Search for Disease Modification in Parkinson’s Disease—A Review of the Literature	Life	EN	Review	Parkinson’s disease; oxidative stress; mitochondria; disease modification	Sporadic Parkinson’s Disease (PD) affects 3% of people over 65 years of age. People are living longer, thanks in large part to improvements in global health technology and health access for non-neurological diseases. Consequently, neurological diseases of senescence, such as PD, are representing an ever-increasing share of global disease burden. There is an intensifying research focus on the processes that underlie these conditions in the hope that neurological decay may be arrested at the earliest time point. The concept of neuronal death linked to ageing- neural senescence- first emerged in the 1800s. By the late 20th century, it was recognized that neurodegeneration was common to all ageing human brains, but in most cases, this process did not lead to clinical disease during life. Conditions such as PD are the result of accelerated neurodegeneration in particular brain foci. In the case of PD, degeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) is especially implicated. Why neural degeneration accelerates in these particular regions remains a point of contention, though current evidence implicates a complex interplay between a vast array of neuronal cell functions, bioenergetic failure, and a dysfunctional brain immunological response. Their complexity is a considerable barrier to disease modification trials, which seek to intercept these maladaptive cell processes. This paper reviews current evidence in the domain of neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease, focusing on alpha-synuclein accumulation and deposition and the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in progressive brain changes. Recent approaches to disease modification are discussed, including the prevention or reversal of alpha-synuclein accumulation and deposition, modification of oxidative stress, alteration of maladaptive innate immune processes and reactive cascades, and regeneration of lost neurons using stem cells and growth factors. The limitations of past research methodologies are interrogated, including the difficulty of recruiting patients in the clinically quiescent prodromal phase of sporadic Parkinson’s disease. Recommendations are provided for future studies seeking to identify novel therapeutics with disease-modifying properties.

The unique substances in soybeans, soy isoflavones, notably genistein, which have a strong antioxidant capacity, are considered to regulate various signaling pathways, alleviate oxidative stress, and improve gut microbiota imbalance as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. In this literature review, we summarize the latest research on genistein, providing evidence of its development and application as a potential drug for preventing and treating five selected diseases (Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cancers). The literature was searched using keywords that include tripartite combinations of genistein and oxidative stress, along with each of the five selected diseases, from PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar between 2014 and 2024. According to current in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials, we comprehensively discuss the therapeutic dose used to target various disease entities to achieve optimal efficacy and meet safety requirements. Moreover, considering the poor water solubility and limited bioavailability of genistein, strategies for improving its therapeutic efficacy, such as combining it with exercise, existing medications, and advanced technologies, as well as applying nanotechnology, were assessed. Therefore, this review aims to provide robust evidence for the development and application of genistein as a potential therapeutic agent or functional food for preventing and treating these diseases.

Despite landmark discoveries in dopamine biology and α-synuclein pathology, translating mechanistic insights into effective, personalized interventions remains elusive. Recent advances in molecular profiling, neuroimaging, and computational modeling have broadened the understanding of PD as a multifactorial systems disorder rather than a purely dopaminergic condition. However, critical gaps persist in diagnostic precision, biomarker standardization, and the translation of bench side findings into clinically meaningful therapies. This review critically examines the current landscape of PD research, identifying conceptual blind spots and methodological shortfalls across pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, trial design, and translational readiness. By synthesizing evidence from molecular neuroscience, data science, and global health, the review proposes strategic directions to recalibrate the research agenda toward precision neurology. Here I highlight the urgent need for interdisciplinary, globally inclusive, and biomarker-driven frameworks to overcome the fragmented progression of PD research. Grounded in the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Parkinson’s Disease (AMP-PD) and the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), this review maps shared biomarkers, open data, and patient-driven tools to faster personalized treatment. In doing so, it offers actionable insights for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers working at the intersection of biology, technology, and healthcare delivery. As the field pivots from symptomatic relief to disease modification, the road forward must be cohesive, collaborative, and rigorously translational, ensuring that laboratory discoveries systematically progress to clinical application.

The complex roles of genetic and epigenetic processes in brain development, synaptic plasticity, and higher-order cognitive abilities were reviewed in this study. Neural progenitors are formed and differentiated according to genetic instructions, whereas epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, dynamically control gene expression in response to external stimuli. These processes shape behavior and cognitive resilience by influencing neural identity, synaptic efficiency, and adaptation. This review also examines how DNA damage and repair mechanisms affect the integrity of neurons, which are essential for memory and learning. It also emphasizes how genetic predispositions and environmental factors interact to determine a person’s susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Developments in gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR, and non-viral delivery techniques provide encouraging treatment avenues for neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights the fundamental role of DNA in coordinating the intricate interactions between molecular and environmental factors that underlie brain function and diseases.

Traditionally cultured in immersion/suspension, organoids face issues like lack of standardization, fusion, hypoxia-induced necrosis, continuous agitation, and high media volume requirements. To address these issues, we developed an air–liquid interface (ALi) technology for culturing organoids, termed AirLiwell. It uses non-adhesive microwells for generating and maintaining individualized organoids on an air–liquid interface. This method ensures high standardization, prevents organoid fusion, eliminates the need for agitation, simplifies media changes, reduces media volume, and is compatible with Good Manufacturing Practices. We compared the ALi method to standard immersion culture for midbrain organoids, detailing the process from human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) culture to organoid maturation and analysis. Air–liquid interface organoids (3D-ALi) showed optimized size and shape standardization. RNA sequencing and immunostaining confirmed neural/dopaminergic specification. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that immersion organoids (3D-i) contained 16% fibroblast-like, 23% myeloid-like, and 61% neural cells (49% neurons), whereas 3D-ALi organoids comprised 99% neural cells (86% neurons). Functionally, 3D-ALi organoids showed a striking electrophysiological synchronization, unlike the heterogeneous activity of 3D-i organoids. This standardized organoid platform improves reproducibility and scalability, demonstrated here with midbrain organoids. The use of midbrain organoids is particularly relevant for neuroscience and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, due to their high incidence, opening new perspectives in disease modeling and cell therapy. In addition to hPSC-derived organoids, the method’s versatility extends to cancer organoids and 3D cultures from primary human cells.

Despite many experimental trials, clinical adoption remains limited. A major barrier is the lack of awareness and confidence among healthcare professionals in these technologies. Methods: This systematic review analyzed the use of wearable sensors for continuous motor monitoring at home, focusing on their purpose, type, feasibility, and effectiveness in neurological, musculoskeletal, or rheumatologic conditions. This review followed PRISMA guidelines and included studies from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results: Seventy-two studies with 7949 participants met inclusion criteria. Neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson’s disease, were the most frequently studied. Common sensors included inertial measurement units (IMUs), accelerometers, and gyroscopes, often integrated into medical devices, smartwatches, or smartphones. Monitoring periods ranged from 24 h to over two years. Feasibility studies showed high patient compliance (≥70%) and good acceptance, with strong agreement with clinical assessments. However, only half of the studies were controlled trials, and just 5.6% were randomized. Conclusions: Wearable sensors offer strong potential for real-world motor function monitoring. Yet, challenges persist, including ethical issues, data privacy, standardization, and healthcare access. Artificial intelligence integration may boost predictive accuracy and personalized care.

Gregorčič, Matic; Georgiev, Dejan	The Usefulness of Wearable Sensors for Detecting Freezing of Gait in Parkinson’s Disease: A Systematic Review	Sensors	EN	Systematic Review	Parkinson’s disease; wearable sensors; freezing of gait	Background: Freezing of gait (FoG) is one of the most debilitating motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD). It often leads to falls and reduces quality of life due to the risk of injury and loss of independence. Several types of wearable sensors have emerged as promising tools for the detection of FoG in clinical and real-life settings. Objective: The main objective of this systematic review was to critically evaluate the current usability of wearable sensor technologies for FoG detection in PD patients. The focus of the study is on sensor types, sensor combinations, placement on the body and the applications of such detection systems in a naturalistic environment. Methods: PubMed, IEEE Explore and ACM digital library were searched using a search string of Boolean operators that yielded 328 results, which were screened by title and abstract. After the screening process, 43 articles were included in the review. In addition to the year of publication, authorship and demographic data, sensor types and combinations, sensor locations, ON/OFF medication states of patients, gait tasks, performance metrics and algorithms used to process the data were extracted and analyzed. Results: The number of patients in the reviewed studies ranged from a single PD patient to 205 PD patients, and just over 65% of studies have solely focused on FoG + PD patients. The accelerometer was identified as the most frequently utilized wearable sensor, appearing in more than 90% of studies, often in combination with gyroscopes (25.5%) or gyroscopes and magnetometers (20.9%). The best overall sensor configuration reported was the accelerometer and gyroscope setup, achieving nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity for FoG detection. The most common sensor placement sites on the body were the waist, ankles, shanks and feet, but the current literature lacks the overall standardization of optimum sensor locations. Real-life context for FoG detection was the focus of only nine studies that reported promising results but much less consistent performance due to increased signal noise and unexpected patient activity. Conclusions: Current accelerometer-based FoG detection systems along with adaptive machine learning algorithms can reliably and consistently detect FoG in PD patients in controlled laboratory environments. The transition of detection systems towards a natural environment, however, remains a challenge to be explored. The development of standardized sensor placement guidelines along with robust and adaptive FoG detection systems that can maintain accuracy in a real-life environment would significantly improve the usefulness of these systems.

Additionally, it explores the potential for application in the gastrointestinal system, particularly in the field of biliary stents, in which development has been limited. In the cardiac field, wireless pacemakers, subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices have been commercialized, significantly improving survival rates and quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases. In the field of brain–neural interfaces, biocompatible flexible electrodes and closed-loop deep brain stimulation have improved treatments of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy. Skin-implantable devices have revolutionized glucose management in patients with diabetes by integrating continuous glucose monitoring and automated insulin delivery systems. Future development of implantable electronic devices incorporating pressure or pH sensors into biliary stents in the gastrointestinal system may significantly improve the prognosis of patients with bile duct cancer. This review systematically organizes the technological advances and clinical outcomes in each field and provides a comprehensive understanding of implantable electronic devices by suggesting future research directions.

Saggio, Giovanni; Roselli, Paolo; Pietrosanti, Luca; Romano, Alessandro; Arangino, Nicola; Patera, Martina; Suppa, Antonio	A New Geometric Algebra-Based Classification of Hand Bradykinesia in Parkinson’s Disease Measured Using a Sensory Glove	Algorithms	EN	Article	geometric algebra; sensory glove; Parkinson’s disease; hand motor assessment	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs motor functions. Clinical assessments have traditionally relied on rating scales such as the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS); however, these evaluations are susceptible to rater-dependent variability and may miss subtle motor changes. This study explored objective and quantitative methods for assessing motor function in PD patients using the Quantum Metaglove, a sensory glove produced by MANUS®, which was used to record finger movements during three tasks: finger tapping, hand gripping, and pronation–supination. Classic and geometric motor features (the latter based on Clifford algebra, an advanced approach for trajectory shape analysis) were extracted. The resulting data were used to train various machine learning algorithms (k-NN, SVM, and Naive Bayes) to distinguish healthy subjects from PD patients. The integration of traditional kinematic and geometric approaches improves objective hand movement analysis, providing new diagnostic opportunities. In particular, geometric trajectory analysis provides more interpretable information than conventional signal processing methods. This study highlights the value of wearable technologies and Clifford algebra-based algorithms as tools that can complement clinical assessment. They are capable of reducing inter-rater variability and enabling more continuous and precise monitoring of hand motor movements in patients with PD.

Bastardo, Rute; Pavão, João; Martins, Ana; Silva, Anabela; Rocha, Nelson	Patient-Oriented Smart Applications to Support the Diagnosis, Rehabilitation, and Care of Patients with Parkinson’s: An Umbrella Review	Future Internet	EN	Systematic Review	umbrella review; Parkinson’s disease; patient-oriented smart applications; Parkinson’s symptoms; diagnosis; monitoring; rehabilitation; disease management	This umbrella review aimed to identify, analyze, and synthesize the results of existing literature reviews related to patient-oriented smart applications to support healthcare provision for patients with Parkinson’s. An electronic search was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed, and, after screening using predefined eligibility criteria, 85 reviews were included in the umbrella review. The included studies reported on smart applications integrating wearable devices, smartphones, serious computerized games, and other technologies (e.g., ambient intelligence, computer-based objective assessments, or online platforms) to support the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with Parkinson’s, improve physical and cognitive rehabilitation, and support disease management. Numerous smart applications are potentially useful for patients with Parkinson’s, although their full clinical potential has not yet been demonstrated. This is because the quality of their clinical assessments, as well as aspects related to their acceptability and compliance with requirements from regulatory bodies, have not yet been adequately studied. Future research requires more aligned methods and procedures for experimental assessments, as well as collaborative efforts to avoid replication and promote advances on the topic.

Chamkouri, Hossein; Motlagh Mohavi, Sahar	Microglia and Macrophages in Central Nervous System Homeostasis and Disease Progression: Guardians and Executioners	Neuroglia	EN	Review	microglia; macrophages; neuroinflammation; blood–brain barrier	Microglia and macrophages are critical immune cells within the central nervous system (CNS), with distinct roles in development, homeostasis, and disease. Once viewed as passive bystanders, these cells are now recognized for their dynamic phenotypic plasticity, which enables them to respond to a wide range of physiological and pathological stimuli. During homeostasis, microglia and CNS-resident macrophages actively participate in synaptic pruning, neuronal support, myelin regulation, and immune surveillance, contributing to CNS integrity. However, under pathological conditions, these cells can adopt neurotoxic phenotypes, exacerbating neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage in diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma. This review synthesizes emerging insights into the molecular, epigenetic, and metabolic mechanisms that govern the behavior of microglia and macrophages, highlighting their developmental origins, niche-specific programming, and interactions with other CNS cells. We also explore novel therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating these immune cells to restore CNS homeostasis, including nanotechnology-based approaches for selective targeting, reprogramming, and imaging. Understanding the complex roles of microglia and macrophages in both health and disease is crucial for the development of precise therapies targeting neuroimmune interfaces. Continued advances in single-cell technologies and nanomedicine are paving the way for future therapeutic interventions in neurological disorders.

Solares, Lucía; Llana, Tania; García-Navarra, Sara; Mendez, Marta	Advances in Virtual Reality-Based Physical Rehabilitation for Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review	Applied Sciences	EN	Systematic Review	virtual reality; neurodegenerative diseases; physical rehabilitation; Parkinson’s disease; multiple sclerosis; motor function; cognitive-motor training; Immersive technology; exergames	Background: Neurodegenerative diseases cause both progressive motor and cognitive impairments for which no curative treatments exist. Virtual reality (VR)-based rehabilitation has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance physical rehabilitation by offering immersive, engaging, and personalized environments. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, examining studies published between 2020 and 2025 in the Web of Science and Scopus. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, focusing on VR-based physical rehabilitation in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. Results: Most studies reported significant improvements in balance, gait, postural control, and motor function. Some studies also found benefits in processing speed, executive function, emotional well-being, and activities of daily living. Across different levels of immersion, VR interventions showed high usability and were well tolerated, even among older adults. However, methodological limitations, such as small sample sizes, a lack of control groups, and short intervention durations, were prevalent. Conclusions: VR has demonstrated to be an effective and well-tolerated tool for the rehabilitation of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. However, the confirmation of its clinical efficacy and long-term impact necessitates the execution of randomized controlled trials with larger samples and extended follow-up periods.

Higuchi, Makoto	Imaging of Proteinopathies in the Brains of Parkinsonian Disorders	Cells	EN	Review	frontotemporal lobar degeneration; multiple system atrophy; Parkinson’s disease; dementia with Lewy bodies; cross-β structure; cryo-electron microscopy	Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and α-synucleinopathies—including Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA)—are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Advances in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have enabled in vivo visualization of these pathologies, particularly tau and α-synuclein fibrils, facilitating early diagnosis and differential classification. Tau PET tracers such as 18F-florzolotau have demonstrated robust imaging of both AD-type and 4-repeat tauopathies, including atypical parkinsonian syndromes in FTLD such as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Cryo-electron microscopy has elucidated the molecular interactions underlying tracer binding, highlighting hydrophobic grooves in cross-βstructures as binding components commonly present in multiple tau fibril types. For α-synucleinopathies, new tracers with a modified cross-β-binding scaffold, including 18F-SPAL-T-06 and 18F-C05-05, have shown promise in detecting MSA-related pathology and, more recently, midbrain pathology in PD and DLB. However, sensitive detection of pathologies in early PD/DLB stages remains a challenge. The integration of high-resolution PET technologies and structurally optimized ligands may enable earlier and more accurate detection of protein aggregates, supporting both clinical decision-making and the development of targeted disease-modifying therapies.

Genchi, Giuseppe; Catalano, Alessia; Carocci, Alessia; Sinicropi, Maria; Lauria, Graziantonio	Copper, Cuproptosis, and Neurodegenerative Diseases	International Journal of Molecular Sciences	EN	Review	copper; copper homeostasis; cuproptosis; mitochondria; neurodegenerative diseases; chelating drugs	Copper is a vital micronutrient for animals and plants acting as a crucial cofactor in the synthesis of numerous metabolic enzymes and contributing to mitochondrial respiration, metabolism, oxido-reductive reactions, signal transmission, and oxidative and nitrosative damage. In the cells, copper may exist in the Cu+ and Cu++ oxidation states and the interconversion between these two states may occur via various redox reactions regulating cellular respiration, energy metabolism, and cell growth. The human body maintains a low level of copper, and copper deficiency or copper excess may adversely affect cellular functions; therefore, regulation of copper levels within a narrow range is important for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Recent studies identified a new copper-dependent form of cell death called cuproptosis. Cuproptosis occurs due to copper binding to lipoylated enzymes (for instance, pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) in the tricarboxylic acid Krebs cycle. In recent years, extensive studies on copper homeostasis and copper-induced cell death in degenerative disorders, like Menkes, Wilson, Alzheimer, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s diseases, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, have discussed the therapeutic potential of targeting cuproptosis. Copper contamination in the environment, which has increased in recent years due to the expansion of agricultural and industrial activities, is associated with a wide range of human health risks. Soil used for the cultivation of grapes has a long history of copper-based fungicide application (the Bordeaux mixture is rich in copper) resulting in copper accumulation at levels capable of causing toxicity in plants that co-inhabit the vineyards. Phytoremediation, which uses plants and biological solutions to remove toxic heavy metals and pesticides and other contaminants from soil and water, is an environmentally friendly and cost-effective technology used for the removal of copper. It requires plants to be tolerant of high levels of copper and capable of accumulating metal copper in plants’ aerial organs and roots. This review aims at highlighting the importance of copper as an essential metal, as well as its involvement in cuproptosis and neurodegenerative diseases.

Pan, Yecan; Liu, Wenkui; Shi, Wenxin; Lv, Ying; Yang, Chen; Wang, Yanjie; Ding, Chao; Hao, Bianqing	Speculation on the Mechanism of Parkinson’s Disease Induced by Risk Residual Pesticides in Fresh Jujube and Hawthorn Through Network Toxicology and Molecular Docking Analysis	Foods	EN	Article	pesticide residues; network toxicology; molecular docking; Parkinson’s disease (PD); fresh jujube; hawthorn	Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is closely related to genetic and environmental factors, among which pesticide exposure is considered an important risk factor. Fresh jujube and hawthorn, as widely consumed fruits, may contain pesticide residues, but the potential effects of long-term low-dose intake on PD are not yet clear. This study combines network toxicology and molecular docking technology to elucidate the molecular mechanism of PD induced by residual pesticides in fresh jujube and hawthorn. Firstly, common risk pesticides (such as organophosphates and pyrethroids) in fresh jujube and hawthorn were screened through the database. Subsequently, a “pesticide target—PD” interactive network was constructed using network toxicology to predict key targets and related pathways. Finally, molecular docking technology was used to verify the binding ability of pesticide molecules to PD-related proteins. The results indicate that some pesticides (such as chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin) may increase the risk of PD by affecting lipid metabolism and oxidative stress response. This study provides a new approach for assessing the neurotoxicity of pesticide residues and suggests the need to pay attention to the potential impact of dietary pesticide exposure on PD, providing a scientific basis for food safety regulation and PD prevention strategies.

Nartea, Roxana; Poenaru, Daniela; Constantinovici, Mariana; Potcovaru, Claudia; Cinteza, Delia	Exploring the Effectiveness of Immersive Virtual Reality Rehabilitation for Parkinson’s Disease: A Narrative Review	Journal of Clinical Medicine	EN	Review	immersive virtual rehabilitation; Parkinson’s disease; rehabilitation; virtual reality	Parkinson’s disease (PD) presents an association of motor and non-motor impairments that impact the independence and quality of life of individuals. Rehabilitation programs must address multiple domains, simultaneously maintaining patients’ adherence and the implications of the disease. Immersive virtual-reality-based rehabilitation (IVRBR) is a promising alternative tool, or can be used in conjunction with traditional or passive programs, using interactive tasks in valid environments with specific training programs adapted to each individual’s needs. This narrative review synthesizes the medical literature published in the last decade from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, on the effectiveness, limitations, and implementations of IVRBR in PD patients. Evidence from RTCs and non-RTCs suggests that IVRBR can improve balance, motor learning, and dual task performance. At the same time, the evidence suggests that it can improve cognitive and emotional status. The integration of objective assessment tools (motion and posture analyses, wearable sensors, center of pressures and machine learning models capable of predicting freezing gait-FoG) enhances clinical and individualized rehabilitation programs. However, the evidence base remains limited, with a small sample size, heterogeneity in measured outcomes, and short follow-up duration. In general, reported adverse reactions were minor, but required standardized reporting patterns. Implementation is challenging due to the equipment cost and varying technological demands, but also due to patient selection and training of the medical personnel. IVRBR is a feasible and engaging alternative or can form part of an individualized rehabilitation program in PD patients; however, future large RTCs, long-term follow-up with standardized protocols, cost-effectiveness analyses, and integration of predictive modeling are essential for its broader clinical usage.
