Abstract: The well-functioning of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is supported by the three-dimensional (3D) brain physiological microenvironment that allows for extensive neural-neural and neural-vascular interactions. This microenvironment is normally hard to create in traditional in-vitro models such as the transwell model. Organ-on-a-chip (OOC) emerges as advanced model systems by providing better physiological microenvironments. However, NVU modeling in many chip platforms has not met a full 3D condition for neural cultures. Here, we describe a novel NVU model generated in a microfluidic chip that reproduces the neural-neural and neural-vascular interactions in a full-3D format. The model features an extracellular matrix (ECM) environment that supports both a perfused brain endothelial vessel and 3D cultured neural cells (astrocytes and neurons) beside the tube. Culture conditions were comprehensively optimized for better endothelial tube integrity as well as ECM gel longevity. The model was used to model neuroinflammation-induced brain tube disruption and immune cell extravasation. Furthermore, as a drug testing platform, the model was explored for brain endothelial transcytosis of the heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) targeted nanobodies (Nbs). Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the expression of endothelial junctional proteins, as well as astrocytic and neuronal markers. The perfused brain endothelial tube exhibited resistance to paracellular leakage of 20 kDa FITC-dextran. Astrocytes and neurons growing in ECM gel developed extensive neural network and showed spontaneous neuronal firing. The neural-vascular interactions were formed through astrocyte migration and axonal outgrowth in the ECM gel towards the tube. Exposure to neuroinflammatory cytokines disrupted the tube barrier, resulting in increased barrier leakage and the recruitment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as their extravasation. Owing to a full-3D model design, endothelial transcytosis and abluminal distribution of the fluorescently labeled HB-EGF targeting Nbs can be clearly visualized in situ. Compared to a transwell model counterpart, the NVU chip model performed better in revealing the binding and transcytosis specificity of the targeted nanobodies. We demonstrate improved physiological relevance in this full-3D NVU-on-a-chip model. The model could become a faithful platform for NVU research under both healthy and diseased conditions, and can be used as a reliable drug testing platform that aims at developing novel brain-targeted therapeutics.

Abstract: Movement disorders can present a significant challenge to healthcare professionals due to their varied etiologies, complex symptomatology, and often debilitating consequences for patients by affecting their quality of life. Functional imaging in movement disorders has demonstrated alterations in the neural activation patterns within the motor networks, thus offering clues toward understanding the molecular basis for motor deficits. This review aims to describe changes in brain structure and function in movement disorders. On that account, the combination of structural and functional imaging of movement disorders provides better diagnostic outcomes. Furthermore, new magnetic resonance imaging technology such as diffusion tensor imaging has shown disconnection of white matter tracts and alterations in connectivity. The investigations into the structural and functional changes of the brain in the context of movement disorders also help understand neuroplasticity, which preserves motor function. Interestingly, functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed that patients with Parkinson’s disease tend to have higher cortical activity in areas such as the primary motor cortex, to counteract the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Likewise, research has demonstrated that patients with Huntington’s disease exhibit altered connectivity patterns between the motor cortex and basal ganglia to mitigate striatal loss. However, these compensatory changes may eventually be overcome as the disease progresses, leading to clinical symptoms. Thus, it is logical to conclude that understanding the underlying structural and functional alterations in the brain associated with these disorders is crucial for accurate diagnosis, effective management, and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Microplastics (MP) and nanoplastics (NP), including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), as well as carbon-based particles such as carbon black (CBP) and black carbon (BC) from incomplete combustion, are widespread environmental pollutants. Their co-occurrence in airborne particulate matter raises concerns about potential impacts on sensitive barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study investigates the effects of CBP and LDPE particles on human cerebral microvascular endothelium hCMEC/D3 cells, an in vitro BBB model. Using a stable NRF2 reporter cell line, we assessed barrier function via transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), particle uptake through confocal microscopy, and morphological changes using CellProfiler. Inflammatory and oxidative stress responses were also evaluated. CBP exposure increased TEER values, suggesting an occluding effect on barrier integrity. Additionally, CBP enhanced phagocytic activity and reduced IL-1β levels, indicating modulation of inflammation. In contrast, although internalized by cells, LDPE particles had minimal impact on morphology, phagocytosis, inflammation, or barrier function. These findings offer new insights into the cellular responses to airborne pollutants, highlighting the differential effects of CBP and LDPE particles on the BBB and underscoring the need for further studies on their combined impact.

Abstract: Previous studies have suggested adaptive changes to dopaminergic activity in the brain may be involved in treatment effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor antidepressants. However, the relative importance of functionally and anatomically distinct dopaminergic cell subgroups in these effects remains unclear. We therefore used dual-label immunohistochemistry for c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase to study effects of acute or chronic administration of fluoxetine in midbrain and pontine dopaminergic cells. Specifically, three groups of female juvenile BALB/c mice (n = 12 each) received either 18 mg/kg/day of fluoxetine in their drinking water for twelve days followed by acute i.p. injection of saline vehicle (chronic group), or received acute i.p. administration of 18 mg/kg of fluoxetine (acute group) or saline (control group). All mice were then subjected to a three-chamber social approach paradigm which induces novelty stress. Immunohistochemistry analysis was conducted in 23 subregions of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The number of activated dopaminergic neurons significantly varied between dopaminergic subnuclei but was not different between the treatment groups in most of the regions. Notable exceptions were the VTA midrostrocaudal interfascicular nucleus, where the number of activated dopaminergic neurons was significantly greater in acute fluoxetine-treated mice compared to controls, and the VTA rostral linear nucleus where this number was reduced in chronic fluoxetine-treated mice. These findings show highly selective effects of fluoxetine on stress-induced cellular activation in a range of dopaminergic cell groups and may provide novel insight into the dopaminergic circuitry involved in its clinical treatment effects.

Abstract: The proteasome, the principal intracellular protein-degradation system, is essential for nerve regeneration after injury.This review summarizes recent evidence that the proteasome orchestrates axonal regeneration by modulating growth-cone formation, microtubule dynamics, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and neuroinflammation. Proteasomes are delivered to growth cones via retrograde axonal transport, and their localization and activity depend on neuronal maturation and axon length.They further promote growth-cone assembly and axonal extension by regulating tubulin expression and polymerization.As key signaling molecules, ROS levels are tightly coupled to proteasome activity; their reciprocal interactions fine-tune axonal regrowth. Notably, immunoproteasome subunits such as PSMB5i contribute to neurodegeneration via inflammatory pathways. In a cohort of 316 ischemic stroke patients, plasma levels of LMP2, MECL-1, and LMP7 were markedly elevated in the 13.3 % who developed hemorrhagic transformation (P < 0.05), suggesting their utility as early biomarkers of stroke complications. Elucidating these proteasome-driven mechanisms in both regeneration and pathology will inform novel therapeutic strategies for neural repair and related disorders.

Abstract: Background
The validity of biomarkers to estimate exposure to selenium (Se) species and selenoproteins in the central nervous system (CNS) is not well studied.
Methods
Among 83 Italian participants with mild cognitive impairment, we estimated total Se and single Se species concentrations in paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples using anion exchange chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry. In each matrix (serum and CSF), we assessed associations between: 1) paired Se species and 2) total Se and Se species.
Results
The distribution of Se exposure was comparable to that generally found in European populations. We found few consistent patterns for most biomarkers, including total Se and some Se species. An exception was a positive association between the two matrices for selenoprotein-P-bound Se and the inorganic Se form selenate, and an unexpected inverse association for glutathione-peroxidase-bound Se. Total Se was positively associated with some Se species but inversely associated with other Se species in serum, while in CSF the positive association was stronger and more consistent across various Se species.
Conclusions
Concentrations of total Se and single Se species in serum were not strongly correlated with their respective concentrations in CSF, the gold standard to estimate CNS exposure. Furthermore, total Se and selected Se species showed consistent positive correlations within CSF but not serum. Our results suggest that relying on serum Se concentrations to assess CNS exposure can introduce error in human studies.

Abstract: Objective
The purpose of this study was to systematically review the literature on the reliability or validity of telehealth spine examination components.
Methods
MEDLINE database from inception to May 17, 2022. Subject headings include virtual, telerehabilitation, telehealth, telemedicine, spine, spinal, neurologic, cervical, thoracic, lumbar, back, and examination. Studies not done synchronously, lacked comparisons to in-person, involved non-spine pathologies, or lacked reliability/validity were excluded. Reliability and validity data were captured using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards. Quality and risk of bias were assessed with Quality Appraisal Tool for Studies of Diagnostic Reliability and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network diagnostic accuracy checklist.
Results
Six studies, with sample sizes of 11 to 100, were included. In 2 studies, Quality Appraisal Tool for Studies of Diagnostic Reliability was low, and the remaining were moderate to high. Two validity studies had high Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network methodologic quality. Two studies suggested high validity and/or reliability for inspection, cranial nerve testing, pain localization, range of motion, deep neck flexion endurance, Lhermitte sign, and cervical spine neuroforaminal compression. Five studies suggested reliability for inspection, lower extremity muscle testing, pain localization, straight leg raise, Sorensen test, 5 repetitive sit-to-stand test, Lasègue test, reverse Lasègue test, Adams test, and pain on heel strike and poor postural inspection reliability.
Conclusion
This review found that components of telehealth spine examinations, such as those done in physical therapy or chiropractic clinical settings, were valid or reliable and provided support for clinical use.

Abstract: In this study an efficient label-free multifunctional probe based on in situ hemoglobin-stabilized silver nanocluster/graphene nanohybridzymes (Hb-AgNCs/graphene NHZs) was designed and employed for dual-modal naked-eye colorimetric and fluorometric detection of cell death biomarkers involved in ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and apoptosis. The interesting feature of developed NHZs is the colorimetric speciation of “turn-on” Fe2+, Cu2+, and Cyt c and “turn-off” cysteine (Cys) and glutathione (GSH), and its speciation ability of Fe2+ from Fe3+as well. The presence of analytes causes a colorimetric limit of detection of 10.8–191 nM and fluorometric detection limit from 0.25 to 121 nM in the appropriate linear ranges, with fast times ranging 5–20 min. The designed NHZs were successfully employed for fluorescence imaging of HT29 human colon cancer and also quantitatively validated in just 2 μL of cell lysates, environmental, and biological samples. Compared to the semi-quantitative conventional Western blot and other cell death assays, the novelty of presented probe is low cost, simple preparation, high sensitivity, multifunctionallity, and dual-modality with the speciation and quantitative ability without using any targeting agent, which makes it appropriate for dual-modal tracking cell death processes and drug evaluation in a very short time.

Abstract: Background
The purpose of this review was to assess the use of lower-limb wearable sensors in monitoring total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) recovery. Outpatient postoperative assessment routinely focuses on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which can be limited by ceiling effects and subjective reporting. Wearable sensors provide objective, real-time, remote data, enabling recovery tracking, rehabilitation protocol adjustments, and patient exercise adherence. Lower-limb sensors are particularly useful, as close proximity allows monitoring of clinical outcomes specific to the affected joint.
Methods
Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched to identify studies on monitoring following arthroplasty. Included articles employed lower-limb wearable devices for continuous, at-home, postoperative monitoring within 18 months of surgery in patients who underwent THA or TKA. Outcomes of interest included PROMs and objective physical activity. Of 532 screened articles, 10 were included; five investigated TKA patients, while five focused on THA. Objective metrics included step counts (n = eight) and range of motion (n = four).
Results
Postoperative outcomes showed significant improvements in the Oxford Hip Score (P < 0.001), Oxford Knee Score (P = 0.020), and University of California, Los Angeles Activity Index (P < 0.001) at three, six, and 12 months postoperatively, respectively. While no significant change in daily steps was noted within six months postoperatively, it significantly increased at final follow-up, within one year of surgery, with TKA and THA patients demonstrating comparable improvements.
Conclusion
The integration of lower-limb wearables into postoperative care for TKA and THA presents an innovative approach to monitoring recovery. Findings from this analysis show differences between TKA and THA, suggesting a unique trajectory for each surgery.

Abstract: Abnormal levels of uric acid (UA) and tryptophan (Trp) in the human body can adversely affect systemic health through multiple physiological pathways. To enable rapid and sensitive simultaneous detection of these biomarkers, a three-dimensional porous carbon material (PC-Z6) with a controllable pore structure and high specific surface area was successfully synthesized through an economical and environmentally friendly NaCl/ZnO dual-template strategy, combined with freeze-drying and high-temperature carbonization processes. The PC-Z6 was further modified with manganese oxide (MnOx) to develop an enzyme-free electrochemical sensor capable of simultaneously detecting UA and Trp in phosphate buffer solution (pH = 6.5). The material was systematically characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, FT-IR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to elucidate its microstructure, crystal structure, porosity, and surface chemical composition. Electrochemical performance was evaluated via cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The experimental results indicate that the MnOx/PC-Z6 composite material possesses abundant electrocatalytic active sites. The sensor fabricated by modifying a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with the MnOx/PC-Z6 composite exhibits excellent detection performance for both UA and Trp, demonstrating a wide linear range (UA: 20.0–3300.0 μM; Trp: 10.0–3200.0 μM) and low detection limits (UA: 1.988 μM; Trp: 0.631 μM; S/N = 3). In practical sample analyses, the spiked recoveries for UA and Trp ranged from 97.30 % to 103.92 %, with relative standard deviations (RSD) below 5 % in three consecutive determinations, demonstrating high accuracy and reproducibility. The MnOx/PC-Z6 composite shows significant potential for constructing simple, efficient, environmentally friendly, and low-cost sensors for simultaneous detection of UA and Trp, indicating promising prospects for clinical application.

Abstract: SUMMARY
Background & aims
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of various nutritional indicators, including undernutrition, malnutrition risk, malnutrition, weight loss, comorbidities, appetite loss, dysphagia, and deficiencies of vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin D, on mortality in older patients.
Methods
This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 1911 older outpatients (mean age: 81.0±13.0 years, 70.8% female). For each patient, age, sex, education level, and comorbid diseases were recorded. Patients with two or more comorbid diseases were classified as having multimorbidity. Nutritional status was assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), dysphagia was measured using Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), and appetite loss was evaluated with Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire (CNAQ). Patients or caregivers reported weight loss over the past three months. Vitamin B12, vitamin D, and folate deficiencies were defined as <200 pg/ml, <30 ng/mL, and <3 ng/ml, respectively.
Results
After a median follow-up of 71.61 months, 413 patients (21.4%) had died. After adjusting for age, sex, and multimorbidity, multivariate hazard ratio analysis showed a significant correlation with mortality (p<0.001) for malnutrition (HR: 4.40), undernutrition (HR: 2.86), weight loss ≥3kg (HR: 2.45), malnutrition risk (HR: 2.13), dysphagia (HR: 1.71), loss of appetite (HR: 1.62), and vitamin D deficiency (HR: 1.62). Multicollinearity and multivariate hazard ratio after adjusted for all confounders, only malnutrition retained statistical significance (HR: 2.10).
Conclusions
Malnutrition, risk of malnutrition and undernutrition, ≥3kg weight loss (using a question derived from the MNA), dysphagia, loss of appetite, and vitamin D deficiency highlight the critical role of nutritional status, these should be considered in the clinic. No significant association was found with weight loss (<3kg), vitamin B12, and folate deficiency.

Abstract: Rivastigmine, a dual cholinesterase inhibitor used for dementia treatment, poses significant environmental concerns due to its persistence in aquatic systems and potential ecotoxicological effects on non-target organisms, necessitating sensitive analytical methods for environmental monitoring. Herein, a novel, sensitive, and environmentally sustainable spectrofluorimetric method was developed for rivastigmine determination using nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon quantum dots (N,S CQDs) as fluorescence probes. The N,S CQDs were synthesized via a rapid microwave-assisted carbonization method and subsequently characterized using different techniques to elucidate their morphological, structural, and optical properties. The fluorescence quenching mechanism was then systematically investigated through Stern-Volmer kinetic analysis at three temperatures (298–313 K) revealing inverse temperature dependence of quenching constants Ksv (5.57 × 105 to 3.86 × 105 M−1), thereby confirming static quenching through ground-state complex formation. Additionally, thermodynamic analysis revealed exothermic binding (ΔH = −21.06 kJ/mol) with spontaneous complex formation. Subsequently, critical analytical parameters including pH, N,S CQDs volume, and reaction time were systematically optimized using Box-Behnken experimental design. Notably, response surface methodology revealed significant factors such as pH and N,S CQDs volume as well as synergistic interactions between these factors, which yielded a predictive mathematical model (R2 = 0.9759) with optimized conditions: pH 6.0, N,S CQDs volume 0.9 mL, and reaction time 3 min. The method was validated according to the ICH guidelines demonstrating high analytical performance with linear range 0.05–1.5 μg/mL (r2 = 0.9996), low detection limit (0.0165 μg/mL), high accuracy (98.92 ± 1.207 %), and good precision (RSD <2 %). The method was then successfully applied to pharmaceutical formulations and environmental water samples with satisfactory recovery rates (95.43–103.26 %). Comprehensive greenness and blueness assessments using AGREE and BAGI tools revealed superior environmental performance (0.77) compared to conventional HPLC-UV methods (0.63) while maintaining acceptable practical applicability (77.5). The developed method offers a viable green alternative for rivastigmine determination in pharmaceutical and environmental analysis.

Abstract: Artificial oxygen carriers assembled using hemoglobin (Hb) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as a promising type of blood substitute for emergency situations. However, current Hb-MOF oxygen carriers are unable to mimic the full functions, even the biconcave morphology of the natural oxygen carrier (red blood cells) in blood. Moreover, the unique properties of MOFs in Hb-MOF oxygen carriers remain to be explored. Herein, using biconcave MOF particles constructed by Tb3+ and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, we synthesized luminescent oxygen carriers with the unique biconcave morphology by covalently conjugating Hb onto the MOF particles. The obtained Hb-MOF oxygen carriers, possessing reversible oxygen-carrying and releasing abilities as well as appropriate biocompatibility, exhibit good oxygen-carrying performance. Moreover, our studies show that benefiting from the characteristic Tb3+ luminescence of the MOF particles, both visualization of the oxygen carrier in blood and sensing of biomolecules, such as dopamine, become possible. These results should shed light on the development of multifunctional artificial oxygen carriers based on MOFs.

Abstract: Given the increasing public concern over health-related issues, multiplexed detection of biomarkers has become essential in biomedical diagnostics. In this study, we developed a novel electrochemical sensor based on calcined γ-graphyne (γ-GYN). The material was synthesized by first preparing γ-graphyne (γ-GY) through an ultrasonic sonochemical method and subsequently calcined at various temperatures to obtain γ-GYN. The calcination process introduces structural imperfections and open edges, transforming γ-graphyne (γ-GY) into a more defect-rich γ-GYN with enhanced electrochemical properties. This modified structure facilitates the simultaneous electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA), and uric acid (UA). The physicochemical properties of γ-GY and γ-GYN materials were systematically characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical performance was evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The γ-GYN modified electrodes demonstrated outstanding sensing performance due to their optimized structural characteristics, featuring a loosely stacked layered structure and increased exposure of active sites. The sensor enabled simultaneous detection of AA, DA, and UA with linear ranges of 200–1000, 0.6–2.0, and 10–1000 μM, respectively. The corresponding detection limits were 36.87 μM for AA, 0.09 μM for DA, and 0.85 μM for UA, with sensitivities of 0.68, 220.49, and 12.77 μA μM−1 cm−2, respectively. These findings not only confirm the excellent performance of γ-GYN-based materials but also establish γ-GYN as a promising platform for electrochemical multi-analyte detection. The integration of γ-GYN into such detection systems opens a new pathway for developing diagnostic tools that are low-cost, portable, and highly sensitive, thereby improving healthcare delivery and reducing healthcare costs associated with managing community health conditions.

Abstract: The walrus optimizer (WO) is a new meta-heuristic algorithm designed to mimic the behaviors of oceanic walruses. However, the consistency of the results is impacted by modifications to the WO parameters. Eventually, the algorithm becomes constrained to local solutions, because minimizing the boundary is likely to lead to overlapping solutions. To address WO’s shortcomings, the proposed version of WO introduces the multi-strategy walrus optimizer (MSWO), an integrated version of WO with several purposeful strategies. Chaotic operator strategy, adaptive strategy, mutation strategy that introduces slight random changes to the search agents, and dynamic boundary location micro-adjustment strategy are some of these purposed strategies. First, a promising chaotic map that expands the search space and provides diversity is used as part of a chaotic approach to stop WO from converging in the early phases of optimization. Second, instability caused by changes in WO parameters is addressed using an adaptive technique. To enhance the population variety of the basic WO, a linear scaling approach is then applied to modify the search agents’ positions inside the dynamic border. The purpose of the dynamic learning procedure is to improve the ability of search agents to adapt to changing locations in the search space. Finally, to improve the speed of MSWO and help it break out of local optimums, a Gaussian mutation strategy is included, which determines the size and direction of these changes using a Gaussian distribution. In evaluation studies, the performance of the proposed MSWO algorithm was confirmed using the CEC2019 and CEC2020 benchmark test functions. The proposed MSWO algorithm was then used to address five conventional engineering problems to demonstrate its dependability and suitability for real-world problems. Furthermore, a few feature selection (FS) problems were used to assess MSWO’s applicability to challenging real-world optimization problems. The results of the evaluation experiments show that the proposed MSWO algorithm performs better than the basic WO method and other well-known algorithms.

Abstract: As the aging population grows, anesthesiologists increasingly care for older surgical patients with geriatric syndromes. This paper reviews key geriatric syndromes, particularly frailty and postoperative delirium, and highlights their implications for anesthesia practice with evidence-based management strategies. Frailty, a predictor of poor surgical outcomes, is often underrecognized preoperatively. Screening tools such as the Fried Frailty Phenotype and Hospital Frailty Risk Score can help identify at-risk patients. Prehabilitation, including exercise, nutritional optimization, and multimodal pain management, may improve surgical recovery. For postoperative delirium, prevention is the most important intervention. Medication reconciliation and multimodal nonpharmacologic approaches, such as restoring sensory aids, optimizing sleep hygiene, and early reorientation, should be prioritized. Other strategies include multimodal analgesia with the minimization of opiates and avoiding deliriogenic medications. Delirium screening using the Confusion Assessment Method or Nurses' Delirium Screening Checklist enables early detection and intervention. Pharmacologic treatment of delirium should be limited to severe agitation, with haloperidol or dexmedetomidine used cautiously. By recognizing frailty and postoperative delirium as geriatric syndromes with potentially modifiable risk factors, anesthesiologists can implement targeted perioperative strategies to improve functional recovery and surgical outcomes in older adults.

Guipi Tang alleviates vascular dementia by regulating purine metabolism via gut microbiota-derived pantothenic acid,
Phytomedicine,

Abstract: Background
Vascular dementia (VD) is the second-most common type of dementia. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a crucial trigger of VD. CCH can disrupt the gut microbiota (GM), thereby exacerbating VD. Guipi Tang (GPT) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula for alleviating dementia. However, the mechanism by which GPT alleviates VD remains unclear.
Purpose
We employed multi-omics techniques to investigate the mechanism of action of GPT in mitigating VD through the metabolites of the GM.
Methods
We used a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model and 16S rDNA sequencing, metabolomics, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses to explore the mitigating effects of GPT on VD. We also used antibiotic treatment, metabolite-backfilling, and other experiments to investigate the role of the GM and its metabolites.
Results
GPT repaired the damage to the hippocampal neurons, blood-brain barrier, and intestinal barrier in VD rats, significantly increased the abundance of Faecalibaculum, and promoted the production of the metabolite pantothenic acid (PA), which was introduced into the bloodstream and translocated in the brain. RNA-Seq and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays also showed that PA regulates purine metabolism and inhibits adenosine triphosphate (ATP) conversion by inhibiting the Vax1-AK8 pathway.
Conclusion
GPT regulates brain purine metabolism to alleviate VD by modulating the Faecalibaculum-PA-Vax1-AK8 pathway. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of VD and highlights the potential of GPT as an effective therapeutic and preventive agent.

Considering Big tau as a novel and specific biomarker for spinal motor neuron pathology,

Abstract: Big tau is an isoform of tau that includes the large 4 A exon, resulting in an extended projection domain and an overall increase in apparent molecular weight from 40 to 65 kDa to 95–110 kDa. Its expression is highly restricted to the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems and select regions of the central nervous system. Although the precise function of Big tau remains unclear, we have proposed that the expanded projection domain of low molecular weight (LMW) tau by 250 amino acids of exon 4a and its structural properties may enhance axonal transport in long-projecting neurons and confer resistance to aggregation. Here, we propose a clinical perspective based on the properties of Big tau: the selective expression of Big tau in spinal motor neurons, but not in upper motor neurons or other spinal neuronal populations, is likely to make Big tau a specific biomarker for spinal motor neuron pathology. This expression pattern may be particularly valuable for tracking disease prognosis and progression in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related disorders, to identify when degeneration advances to lower motor neurons. Big tau could thus serve as a more specific biomarker to neurofilament or LMW tau proteins or can be used in combination with other biomarkers to enhance the specificity and sensitivity. This hypothesis can be readily tested using existing samples and assays applied to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from patients. If validated through clinical studies, Big tau may provide clinicians with a new tool to better diagnose and monitor a variety of motor neuron degenerative disorders. To accelerate research in this area, I offer to share experimental data and an inventory of polyclonal antibodies specific to Big tau to the research community to enable further investigation of Big tau as a clinical biomarker.

Abstract: Background
The suggested immobilization test investigates restless legs syndrome symptoms in a controlled environment. Given the procedure's unique features and strengths, we traced its methodological evolution, investigated its utilization in RLS efficacy trials, and compared SIT metrics with conventional outcome measures.
Methods
We registered the study in PROSPERO (CRD42024542580). A systematic review was performed using four databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases) from inception to January 2024. RLS placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials that used SIT were included in the final review. Cohen's d effect size was calculated for the outcome measures to standardize and compare IRLS and PSG PLMI with discomfort score and PLMI on SIT. A narrative review of SIT was also performed to analyze the methodological evolution.
Results
Eight hundred eighty-two studies were screened, and nine RCTs were included in this systematic review. Since its inception in 1988, the methodology has evolved over the years, including multiple SITs to capture circadian fluctuations and a refined discomfort scale. The majority of RCTs were performed in Europe, and only one RCT with SIT was conducted in the USA. Cohen's effect size analysis suggested the superior performance of the SIT PLM index over PLMSI on PSG, while IRLS captured a larger effect size compared to SIT DS.
Conclusion
Despite robust assessment of current RLS symptoms by SIT/mSIT, they remain underutilized in RLS efficacy trials. mSIT captures all RLS features in a controlled environment, and it adds depth, precision and critical complementary data to conventional RLS outcome measures in RLS treatment evaluations.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease remains a leading global cause of mortality, with inflammation playing a crucial role in driving its pathology. Despite advancements in cardiovascular disease management, current treatment options primarily address risk factors and symptoms rather than underlying disease mechanisms. Among the key mechanistic drivers are the NLRP3 multiprotein inflammasome complexes of the innate immune system, which are activated in response to cellular stress or injury. One of the key downstream effectors of NLRP3 activation is gasdermin D, which forms pores in the plasma membrane to initiate pyroptotic cell death, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review will highlight the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis in driving cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and diabetic cardiomyopathy. It will also identify recent innovative therapeutic approaches that target the NLRP3 inflammasome-gasdermin D axis, which are currently being evaluated in preclinical studies and clinical trials.

Abstract: Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Homocysteine (Hcy) is converted to Hcy thiolactone (HTL) in error-editing reactions catalyzed by methionine-tRNA synthetase (MARS). HTL forms isopeptide bonds with lysine residues of target proteins in a process known as N-homocysteinylation (N-Hcy), which contributes to the neurotoxicity of Hcy in PD pathogenesis. Thus, MARS may represent a potential target for controlling hyperhomocysteinemia-associated neurotoxicity. Here we tested the effect of MARS on protein N-Hcy in cultured cells, MPTP-induced mouse model of PD, and mice injected with α-synuclein PFFs. We found that the protein N-Hcy levels were increased in the brains of PD model mice. MARS knockdown ameliorates protein N-Hcy, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and α-synuclein aggregation in cells. MARS knockdown also alleviated dopaminergic neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits in mice injected with MPTP. In mice injected with α-synuclein fibrils, MARS knockdown attenuated α-synuclein aggregation, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and motor impairments. These results indicate that inhibition of MARS attenuates PD-like pathology induced by hyperhomocysteinemia.

Abstract: Protein aggregation is a common characteristic of numerous neurodegenerative diseases and presents challenges in biotechnology and pharmaceutical formulations. Urea, a well-known denaturant, has been widely studied for its role in protein folding and unfolding. However, its potential role in preventing protein aggregation and mitigating macromolecular crowding effects remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which lower concentration of urea influences protein aggregation in crowded environments. Using a combination of spectroscopic techniques, microscopic, and aggregation assays, we demonstrate that urea modulates protein-solvent interactions, reduces intermolecular contacts that drive aggregation, and alleviates excluded volume effects in crowded solutions. Our findings suggest that urea acts not only as a chemical chaperone but also as a tunable modulator of protein solubility in physiologically relevant conditions. These insights provide a deeper understanding of urea's multifaceted role in protein chemistry and may have implications for therapeutic strategies targeting protein misfolding diseases.

Abstract: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large and pharmaceutically significant family of membrane proteins that mediate a wide range of physiological responses. Conventional modulation strategies primarily target orthosteric sites, but recent studies have identified a novel class of modulators known as ‘molecular glues’ that stabilize specific receptor–transducer interfaces. This review categorizes molecular glues into three mechanistic groups on the basis of their mode of action: those that directly stabilize receptor–transducer complexes, those that induce biased signaling through allosteric interactions, and those that modulate signaling indirectly by targeting allosteric regulatory sites. With advances in structural biology and computational methodologies, molecular glues are increasingly recognized as promising biased agonists, next-generation therapeutic agents, and valuable chemical tools for elucidating GPCR signaling pathways.

Abstract: pediatric inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by progressive visual function impairment, often manifesting from early childhood. These conditions arise from dysfunction in retinal morphogenesis, phototransduction, and cellular maintenance pathways, involving photoreceptors, the retinal pigment epithelium, and glial systems. This review provides an integrated analysis of the molecular underpinnings, phenotypic variability, diagnostic advancements, and emerging therapeutic avenues for pediatric IRDs. By systematically retracing the literature and leveraging over a decade of laboratory experience, we dissect each major form of pediatric IRD—such as Leber congenital amaurosis, retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, achromatopsia, and syndromic entities like Usher and Bardet-Biedl syndromes—emphasizing genotype-phenotype correlations and shared pathogenic pathways. Additionally, we discuss next-generation sequencing, advanced bioinformatics, and AI-based diagnostics, along with gene therapy, genome editing, and emerging biotechnologies. By mapping IRDs to molecular networks through Cytoscape and functional genomics, we identify converging pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. This compendium aims to serve as a reference for clinicians, researchers, and genetic counselors navigating the evolving IRD landscape.

Abstract: Importance
Despite the emergence of anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's disease, targeting modifiable risk factors remains the most effective primary prevention strategy for dementia. While cognitive benefits of multimodal lifestyle interventions have been demonstrated, the underlying effects on brain structure remain unclear, likely due to heterogeneity in brain structure among at-risk individuals.
Objective
To investigate how distinct subgroups of at-risk individuals, defined by cortical and subcortical grey matter (GM) patterns, differ in their response to the FINGER intervention, as well as in their demographic, vascular, and lifestyle profiles.
Design
Observational study employing unsupervised clustering of MRI-based cortical thickness and subcortical volume metrics, followed by longitudinal assessment of a lifestyle intervention.
Setting
The FINGER randomized controlled trial (RCT), a population-based, multidomain lifestyle intervention targeting older adults (aged 60–77) with elevated cardiovascular risk (CAIDE score ≥ 6) and average to slightly below-average cognitive performance.
Participants
A total of 120 participants (61 intervention, 59 control) with available baseline MRI data.
Intervention
Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, double-blind) to a 2-year multidomain lifestyle intervention group – targeting diet, physical activity, cognitive training, social engagement, and metabolic and vascular risk management – or to a control group receiving standard health advice.
Main Outcomes and Measures
Sociodemographic, vascular, and lifestyle factors, medical comorbidities, and cognitive performance, were assessed at baseline (pre-intervention). Additionally, brain structural outcomes (mean cortical thickness, Alzheimer’s disease and resilience-related cortical signatures, hippocampal volume), and cognition (global, executive function, processing speed, memory) were analysed post-intervention using hierarchical linear models stratified by GM cluster.
Results
Clusters with diffuse or frontal-predominant cortical thinning, but with more favourable vascular profiles, characterized by lower blood pressure and reduced obesity, showed significantly less cortical thinning (mean thickness, AD-signature, and resilience-signature regions; all p < 0.05) following the intervention.
Conclusions and Relevance
Stratifying at-risk individuals by GM patterns and vascular risk revealed differential brain responses to the FINGER intervention. These findings underscore the value of brain-based subtyping to optimize personalized dementia prevention strategies in heterogeneous at-risk populations.

Abstract: Summary
Objectives: To investigate prefrontal cortex activation during single- and dual-task treadmill exercises at an imposed speed and a speed selected by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Eleven patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr's stages I–II) and 11 matched healthy controls (HC) performed six 2-minute tasks on a treadmill: two static cognitive tasks, two single-task walking tests and two dual-task walking tests, with each walking test being performed at an imposed and at a self-selected speed. The hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were measured continuously using functional near-infrared spectroscopy to evaluate cortical activation. The perceived difficulty of the task, cognitive performance and gait parameters were also assessed. Results: For the walking tasks, the HCs activated their PFC during dual-tasks (P<0.01) but not when carrying out single-tasks, unlike PD patients who activated their PFC at a similar level for both the single-task and dual-task at an imposed speed (P<0.05); no activation occurred at a self-selected speed. Perceived difficulty of the task was significantly greater among PD patients than among HCs (P<0.05) and while executing dual-task more than single-tasks (P<0.001). Variability in the pace was higher among PD patients than among HCs (P<0.01). Conclusion: Imposing a walking speed on a treadmill for PD patients with mild disease severity increases their PFC activity. However, PD patients were unable to further boost PFC activity when a cognitive task was added to the imposed walking speed.

Abstract: Backgrounds
Acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion (AESD) is the most frequent form of acute encephalopathy in early childhood in Japan. Magnetic resonance imaging provides useful hallmarks of diagnosing AESD. However, metabolomic profiles for AESD remain elusive. This study investigates whether measurement of amino acids in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is useful for the diagnosis of AESD before onset.
Methods
In the first study, CSF samples were collected from patients (11 AESD and 17 controls) admitted to Kyushu University Hospital during 2011–2016. Amino acids in the CSF were analyzed using mass spectrometry. Cytometric bead arrays were used to measure cytokine and chemokine levels in the CSF. The second study was performed by recruiting patients (8 AESD patients and 10 controls) admitted during 2011–2024. CSF samples were stored at −20 °C for 1 month to 12 years.
Results
In the first study, glutamate levels in the CSF from AESD patients were higher than in controls and correlated with methionine, threonine, and tyrosine levels. A correlation map of cytokines and amino acids revealed that glutamate formed a cluster with IL-1β, IL-10, and IL-12 p70. In the second study, no difference in glutamate levels was observed between AESD and control groups.
Conclusions
CSF glutamate potentially serves as a useful marker for diagnosing AESD. The long-term storage of CSF samples was likely to cause a decay of glutamate in the CSF. Prospective studies using fresh CSF samples are necessary to validate the results in this study.

Abstract: Heavy metal ions and mycotoxins pose serious risks to food safety and public health. Conventional analytical methods such as chromatography and mass spectrometry are accurate but remain costly, labor-intensive, and unsuitable for rapid on-site monitoring. Aptamers, synthetic single-stranded DNA or RNA obtained through SELEX, provide high affinity, good stability, and easy modification, making them attractive recognition elements for biosensor design. This review highlights recent progress in aptamer-based biosensors for detecting toxic metals (Hg2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, As3+, Ag+, Cu2+, Mn2+) and mycotoxins (OTA, AFB1, ZEN, DON, FB1). With the aid of nanomaterials, optical and electrochemical transduction, and molecular amplification, many sensors have achieved ultra-low detection limits from nanomolar to femtomolar levels, together with improved selectivity and performance in complex matrices. Current challenges include limited availability of high-affinity aptamers, matrix interference, and lack of standardized protocols. Future advances are expected through high-throughput aptamer screening, multimodal sensing strategies, and integration with portable microfluidic or paper-based devices to promote applications.

Abstract: Objective
This study aims to provide insight in the long-term outcomes of patients treated with the Gore Excluder Iliac Branch Endoprosthesis (IBE) for aneurysms involving the common iliac artery. Both technical, clinical, and patient reported outcomes were evaluated.
Methods
This is an investigator initiated, international, real world post-market, multicenter, prospective cohort study, enrolling patients with an indication for elective treatment of an (aorto)iliac aneurysm using the Gore Excluder IBE. Technical and clinical outcomes were collected through 5-year follow-up, together with questionnaire data.
Results
Of the initially 100 enrolled patients, 69 patients completed the 5-year follow-up. The 5-year freedom from all-cause and aneurysm-related mortality was, respectively, 82.9% and 96.0%. The 5-year primary patency of the hypogastric artery was 84.0%. The median abdominal aortic aneurysm and common iliac artery diameters decreased significantly between baseline and 5-year follow-up (-8.0mm, p=0.001, -6.8mm, p<0.001, respectively). One type 1b and one type 1c endoleak were detected between 2-5 years follow-up which were successfully treated. Two type III endoleaks were discovered during follow-up. There were no significant differences in the occurrence nor severity of intermittent claudication between baseline and 5-year follow-up. The outcomes on the IIEF-5 questionnaire on erectile dysfunction showed a significant decrease between baseline (median 12.5; IQR 3.0-20.0) and 5-years follow-up (median 4.0; IQR 1.0-16.0), p=0.001. The EQ5D and WIQ showed no differences between baseline and 5-years follow-up.
Conclusions
The results of this study support the continued use of the Gore Excluder IBE in the treatment of aortoiliac aneurysms, demonstrating favorable long-term outcomes in terms of patency, sac remodeling, clinical outcomes and questionnaire outcomes.

Abstract: The development of efficient and portable sensors for detecting pesticide residues in food and medicinal materials is crucial for human health and public safety. To meet the demands of on-site detection and rapid enforcement, simple, rapid, intelligent, and visualized detection methods have become emerging trends. Molecularly imprinted sensors (MIPs) represent an advanced detection technology capable of efficiently recognizing specific molecules for rapid pesticide residue analysis. This review summarizes recent advances over the past five years in MIP-based sensors across various systems, with a focus on electrochemical, optical, and photoelectrochemical applications. Furthermore, we highlight the integration of MIPs with smartphones for portable and visualized detection, emphasizing the potential of smartphone-based image processing and data analysis in this field. This review aims to provide new insights into the broad application of MIP-based biosensors in food safety, environmental monitoring, and agricultural regulation.

Abstract: Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI), commonly referred to as chemobrain, is a prevalent side effect of cancer treatment that severely affects survivors' quality of life. Chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel, cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induce neurotoxicity, resulting in cognitive dysfunction. These agents trigger reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and induce DNA damage, all of which impair synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to chemobrain, as it disrupts ATP production, increases oxidative stress, and leads to neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage caused by agents like cisplatin impairs oxidative phosphorylation, exacerbating neuronal degeneration. The molecular mechanisms of chemobrain likely involve several key players, including NAMPT-dependent NAD+ depletion and increased levels of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which collectively exacerbate oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Another important molecular target is the Adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). When activated, it contributes to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline, particularly in chemotherapy-related cognitive deficits in the hippocampus. This review explores the complex interplay of these core pathologies in chemobrain and discusses how targeting these pathways could offer a therapeutic strategy to alleviate cognitive impairments in cancer survivors.

Abstract: Stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, imposing a substantial financial burden on healthcare systems and significantly impacting survivors’ quality of life. Endovascular recanalization through thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy is the current standard of care for ischemic stroke. However, these interventions are constrained by a narrow therapeutic window, and stroke outcomes remain suboptimal despite timely treatment. Clinical evidence suggests a strong correlation between infarct size and adverse clinical outcomes. This review explores existing literature and emerging therapeutic strategies beyond endovascular recanalization that aim to reduce cerebral infarct size. It identifies a variety of interventions that have shown therapeutic potential, particularly in animal models. However, it highlights that findings from animal studies have yet to be extensively translated into humans and may be an asset to improving neurological recovery and overall patient outcomes. Additionally, this review emphasizes the need for adjunctive therapies to complement standard reperfusion treatment, with the goal of improving neurological recovery and overall patient outcomes.

Abstract: Diabetic encephalopathy, a significant complication of diabetes, is primarily characterized by cognitive dysfunction, manifesting as deficits in learning and memory. In recent years, the global rise in diabetes prevalence has been paralleled by an increase in the incidence of diabetic encephalopathy. In some patients, this condition is further aggravated by coexisting Alzheimer's disease, leading to even more pronounced cognitive decline. Despite ongoing research, the pathogenesis of diabetic encephalopathy remains largely exploratory, and the development of targeted therapies has yet to yield significant breakthroughs. A cornerstone of disease research is the use of cell and animal models, which serve to simulate the onset and progression of various conditions. To date, over ten models have been developed for the study of diabetic encephalopathy, each offering distinct advantages and limitations, and their suitability varies depending on the research context. This review examines the current cell and animal models of diabetic encephalopathy and evaluates the rationale for model selection based on different research directions and perspectives, aiming to provide a valuable reference for advancing our understanding of the disease's pathogenesis and for facilitating drug development.

Abstract: There are viral pathogen pathways to initiate autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, directly or indirectly, by reactivating latent viruses including human herpesviruses. After initial infections, these DNA viruses can enter latency but periodically reactivate into active infections following triggers: medical treatments inducing immunosuppressions; and infections by immunosuppressive pathogens including RNA viruses, stress or malnutrition. An indirect causation pathway for autoimmune diseases can utilize immune suppressions by RNA virus infections, which trigger reactivation of latent herpesviruses capable of directly causing autoimmune diseases. Although it is believed that general inflammation, not specific pathogens, causes autoimmune diseases, experimental evidence indicates autoimmune diseases are caused by herpesvirus reactivations. Such viral reactivations can be induced by immunosuppressions during severe pathogen infections, particularly by RNA virus infections.

Abstract: The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is essential for the health and function of the retina and, more specifically, the photoreceptors. Hence, the dysfunction of RPE leads to various retinal degeneration diseases. The rising prevalence of these disorders highlights the need for effective, large-scale cell-based therapies, particularly those utilizing stem cell-derived RPE cells. This study presents the development of a biodegradable, smooth surface microcarrier designed to facilitate the expansion and maturation of RPE cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system with polycaprolactone (PCL) porous microcarriers, we demonstrate that RPE cells exhibit comparable adhesion and growth on microcarriers as they do on traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture plates. The microcarrier system facilitates efficient maturation and yields higher quantities of functional RPE cells, highlighting its potential for large-scale production to meet both clinical demands and in vitro large-scale screening studies. Moreover, RPE cells cultured on this microcarrier can be directly frozen and recovered, maintaining their phenotypic and functional integrity upon thawing. This research showcases the scalability and practicality of RPE cell production, providing a robust solution for the storage and delivery of RPE cells. While our results establish the feasibility of direct cryopreservation and recovery of monolayer RPE cells on microcarriers, the designation of a ‘ready-to-use’ product format is preliminary and will require expanded assessment of long-term functionality, safety, and direct translational outcomes in future studies.

Abstract: Background
Insomnia is a causal risk factor for depression, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Reduced cognitive flexibility, a component of executive function, is linked to both insomnia and depression and may mediate their relationship. This systematic review evaluated this potential mediation model by examining studies reporting associations among insomnia, cognitive flexibility, and depression.
Methods
A comprehensive search identified 35 studies reporting associations between insomnia and cognitive flexibility (a path) and 11 studies examining cognitive flexibility as a predictor of future depression (b path). No studies formally tested cognitive flexibility as a mediator of the insomnia-depression relationship (ab path). Studies were assessed for quality and capacity for directional and causal inference. Findings were synthesized to evaluate the mediation model.
Results
For the a path, 35 studies reported 117 eligible associations. Longitudinal studies consistently reported null associations between insomnia and cognitive flexibility. Cross-sectional findings were also predominantly null. Significant associations generally did not withstand covariate adjustment or were observed only in older participants or those taking benzodiazepines. For the b path, 11 prospective cohort studies reported 37 eligible associations. Most associations were null, but significant associations emerged in participants without baseline depression, suggesting cognitive flexibility may relate more to depression risk than prognosis.
Conclusions
Current evidence does not support reduced cognitive flexibility as a mediator in the insomnia-depression pathway. Subjective cognitive concerns may offer a more promising explanatory mechanism. Future research should integrate objective and subjective cognitive assessments, test formal mediation models, and evaluate alternative pathways.

Abstract: Retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma leads to progressive and irreversible vision loss. Investigating lipidomic profiles of aqueous humor and plasma from primary glaucoma patients may reveal novel lipid signaling pathways and biomarkers. Plasma lipidomics was included to assess systemic alterations, enabling comparison with ocular changes and explore accessible, minimally invasive biomarker sources. This study included patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), and cataract controls (n = 20 in each group). Serum lipid screening was conducted via biochemical analyzer. Aqueous humor and plasma samples were collected, and lipids were extracted and analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Spectral identification and relative quantification of lipid species were performed with LipidSearch™ver_4.1. The percentage of altered species within each lipid class was analyzed with a log2fold change (FC) threshold ≥1/≤-1. Data normalization and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted using MetaboAnalyst 5.0 with significance criteria (log2 FC ≥ 1/≤−1, p < 0.05 and variable importance in projection (VIP) > 1). No significant changes were observed in routine serum lipid profiles of glaucoma patients versus controls. In aqueous humor, phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines (>50 %) were elevated in aqueous humor of both glaucoma groups, while sphingomyelins (>85 %) and ceramides (18.75 %) were specifically elevated in PACG. Of 301 lipid species identified in aqueous humor, 51 met significance (POAG: 24, PACG: 27). In plasma, diglycerides (>20 %), triglycerides and cholesterol esters (>10 %, log2FC ≤ −1) were declined in both glaucoma groups than controls. Of 1762 plasma lipids identified, 100 met significance (POAG: 47, PACG: 53). Sphingomyelin and ceramide alterations in PACG aqueous humor suggested disrupted mechanosignaling mechanisms. Altered phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and glycerides linked with retinal-degeneration and apoptosis in both glaucomatous conditions.

Abstract: Atractylenolides (I, II, and III), active sesquiterpene lactones from Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz, exhibit diverse pharmacological activities but have been reported to impair drug-metabolizing enzymes and hepatocellular function. However, a comprehensive safety assessment of these compounds remains lacking. In this study, we investigated the developmental toxicity profile of Atractylenolides (I, II, and III) in zebrafish embryos, with a particular focus on hepatotoxicity and its underlying mechanisms. Exposure to Atractylenolides (I, II, and III) resulted in concentration-dependent mortality, with 96-h median lethal concentrations (LC₅₀) of 81.64 μM, 138.40 μM, and 151.90 μM, respectively. Atractylenolides (I, II) induced multiple developmental abnormalities, among which Atractylenolide-I uniquely led to neuronal developmental arrest and diminished locomotor activity. Importantly, Atractylenolides (I, II) exhibited marked hepatotoxicity, evidenced by liver shrinkage, reduced liver-specific fluorescence intensity, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In contrast, exposure to Atractylenolide-III did not induce significant toxic effects. Network toxicology analysis revealed that cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolism and apoptosis were closely associated with Atractylenolides (I, II) induced hepatotoxicity. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that Atractylenolides (I, II) suppressed mRNA expression of key drug-metabolizing genes, including cyp3c1 and cyp3a65. Simultaneously, Atractylenolides (I, II) downregulated genes associated with cell proliferation (top2α, uhrf1). Co-treatment with the hepatoprotective agent silybin partially reversed the liver injury and the alterations in drug metabolism gene expression induced by Atractylenolides (I, II). Collectively, our results provide important insights into the safety evaluation of Atractylenolides (I, II, and III).

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, memory impairment, and neuroinflammation. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) represents a critical therapeutic target due to its role in acetylcholine regulation and amyloid-beta aggregation. This study evaluated five synthesized acridine derivatives (AAM7, AAM5, AC8, AC6, AM1) as potential AChE inhibitors through molecular docking, dynamics simulations, ADMET profiling, and cytotoxicity assessment using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Molecular docking revealed AAM7 exhibited the highest binding affinity (-10.6 kcal/mol) to AChE, followed by AAM5, AC6, and AC8 (each −10.2 kcal/mol), while AM1 showed the lowest affinity (-9.1 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed AAM7's stable protein-ligand interactions with consistent hydrogen bonding (>70 % trajectory occupancy) and π-π stacking with key residues Tyr124, Asp74, Ser125, and Trp86. ADMET analysis demonstrated favorable CNS penetration for all compounds, with AAM7 showing optimal drug-like properties (MW: 383.49 g/mol, LogP: 4.65, TPSA: 45.23 Å²) despite moderate solubility concerns. Cytotoxicity studies revealed AC6 as the most potent compound (IC₅₀: 135.56 μg/ml), followed by AM1 (IC₅₀: 202.36 μg/ml), while AAM7 demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity (IC₅₀: 394.02 μg/ml), indicating superior safety profile. Network analysis identified AChE as a central hub protein in neurodegeneration pathways. These findings establish AAM7 as a promising lead compound for AD therapy, combining strong AChE binding affinity with favorable safety characteristics, warranting further optimization for clinical development.

Abstract: Background
A lipophilic, reddish pigment derived from microorganisms and marine organisms, astaxanthin (ASX) exhibits substantial antioxidant activities. ASX is utilized in various forms, serving as a food colorant, antioxidant, and pharmaceutical ingredient.
Methods
The current narrative review summarized the beneficial effects of astaxanthin on health. All studies, including in vitro, in vivo, systematic reviews, from years 2000–2025, were evaluated.
Results
Research supports its preventive and therapeutic effects on cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), inflammation, diabetes and nervous system, which can largely be ascribed to its inherent properties of anti-inflammation and antioxidant capabilities. Preclinical investigations, have demonstrated that ASX exerts its anti-tumorigenic effects. ASX acts through mechanisms related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial targeting. Additionally, ASX enhances the susceptibility of cancerous cells to chemotherapeutic agents while mitigating side effects. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated its ability to inhibit tumor progression, enhance apoptotic pathways, modulate gene expression associated with cellular viability and death, prevent damage to DNA, and subsequently induce cell cycle arrest in various cancerous models. Promising results in cancer treatment, along with its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, underscore its potential as an adjuvant therapy to enhance the effectiveness of various cancer treatments in the future.
Conclusions
ASX demonstrates significant potential in impeding proliferation, motility, and also invasion of cancer cells, while enhancing the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents through multiple mechanisms. Utilizing innovative nanotechnology, a range of delivery vehicles, notably solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), have been engineered to encapsulate ASX, thereby enhancing its stability and bioavailability.

Abstract: Abstract concepts such as justice are not directly tied to our sensory or motor experiences, yet they constitute an essential part of our knowledge. A longstanding question is how the brain, shaped by survival pressures, encodes these abstract concepts. This study investigated how vertical spatial representations relate to moral concept encoding in the brain (“good is up; bad is down”). We found that vertical positional processing and moral semantics elicited characteristic activation patterns, which enabled the learned neural distinctions between up and down to be generalized to decode the neural signatures of moral and immoral concepts, and vice versa, suggesting shared neural signatures between the two concept domains. Most of the vertical metaphorical representations of morality were independent of the encoding of pleasant vs. unpleasant affect, indicating the specificity of the vertical spatial representation that could not be attributed to the generic representation of arbitrary magnitude or polarity. Nonetheless, morality encoding did not rely solely on vertical spatial information, in that the morality of a word could also be decoded from neural signatures in non-spatial areas. These findings highlight both the spatial metaphorical associations and the domain-specific information in the neural representation of moral concepts.

Abstract: The protective efficacies of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) against the toxicity of compounds containing arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium and mercury, were compared to those of dimercaprol, dimercaptosuccinic acid, 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulphonate, D-penicillamine, and derivatives of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic in CHO-K1 cells. Both NAC and NACA were found to confer protection against these metals, with comparable or better efficacy than many of the test chelators. Results from studies using the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulphoximine were consistent with NAC/NACA protection being mediated through both GSH up-regulation and chelation. Given NAC’s activity against metal toxicity, widespread clinical use, parenteral or oral routes of administration, high clinical safety, low cost and ease of accessibility, it should be given consideration as a broad-spectrum protectant against toxic metal poisoning as a treatment or adjunct/combination treatment. Its more lipophilic derivative NACA, also warrants attention, especially in those cases where brain toxicity is a concern.

Abstract: Introduction
This study systematically investigated the associations of levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) with clinical-phase Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to evaluate their potential as biomarkers.
Methods
A systematic search of major English and Asian language databases was conducted from inception to December 2024. Following the screening process using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 12 human studies were selected for review. The sample consisted of 1316 participants (806 with clinical-phase AD patients and 510 controls), including 49.7% males with a mean age of 71.2. The outcomes for comparisons between AD status groups were concentrations of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and stromelysins (MMP-3, MMP-10), TIMPs (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2), as well as the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio in body fluids. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) were computed using random-effects models and adjusting for the moderators, comprising demographic factors (population, sex, age) and body fluid type, in the meta-analysis. Forest plots and funnel plots were generated to visualize the results and assess publication biases, respectively.
Results
Levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls with the corresponding pooled SMDs (95 %CI) of 0.69 (0.25 to 1.13) and 0.45 (0.08 to 0.82). The association of MMP-3 level with AD status was moderated by population, sex, and body fluid type, whereas the association of MMP-9 was not. The Egger’s tests revealed no statistically significant publication biases (P > 0.05).
Discussion
This study provides a summary of the past-decade findings about the levels of MMPs and TIMPs in AD patients and controls. Our findings indicate that elevated MMP-3 and MMP-9 are associated with AD. MMP-9, regardless of body fluid type, could be universally used for screening AD individuals with relevance across various demographic groups.

Abstract: Propolis is a resinous substance produced by bees, known for a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. This study focused on organic propolis Type 1 (OP1), collected from the native forest of General Carneiro, Paraná, Brazil. The ethanolic extract of OP1 was microencapsulated in three formulations: extract + gum arabic by spray drying (GA + OPE), extract + vegetable fat by spray chilling (VF + OPE), and extract + gum arabic + vegetable fat by spray drying (GA + VF + OPE). Particles were characterized for physical properties and subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, followed by epithelial transport assays using Caco-2 monolayers. Bioaccessible and basolateral fractions were analyzed by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS, and antioxidant activity was assessed against reactive oxygen species. The anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with a luciferase reporter gene by measuring NF-κB activation, TNF-α secretion, and CXCL2/MIP-2 production. Chemical analysis revealed a predominance of lignans and phenolic acids, with distinct release kinetics among formulations during digestion. GA + VF + OPE particles showed significantly higher antioxidant activity (p < 0.05) against peroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid and demonstrated superior anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB activation (28 %) and TNF-α secretion (53 %) at 100 μg propolis/mL. In conclusion, the encapsulation strategies preserved the bioactive properties of OP1, with GA + VF + OPE particles emerging as the most promising formulation. Future studies should explore their incorporation into functional food products.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Patients with factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency exhibit bleeding tendency that is challenging to diagnose, wherein coagulation test results, such as prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, typically reveal normal findings. Herein, we report a 64-year-old man who presented to our hospital with FXIII deficiency. The patient had a medical history of asthma, Parkinson’s disease, hypertension, a large abdominal artery aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and asymptomatic cerebral infarction. He was diagnosed with a left-sided mandibular dentigerous cyst. Dentigerous cystectomy and third molar extraction were performed without any significant complications. However, upon returning to the hospital room, the patient experienced persistent ongoing oozing from the surgical site. The bleeding persisted; FXIII deficiency was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed on postoperative day ten. Following FXIII concentrate administration, the patient exhibited significant improvements in postoperative bleeding. FXIII deficiency should be considered in cases of severe oozing, even when coagulation testing reveals no major abnormal findings. Additionally, a disseminated intravascular coagulation score based on the Japanese criteria might be effective in evaluating the risk of postoperative bleeding, including FXIII deficiency.

Abstract: Introduction
A potential inflammation-associated periventricular gradient of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) abnormalities has been identified in multiple sclerosis, but its presence in normal aging and other neurological diseases remains unclear.
Objectives
We aimed to determine whether a periventricular gradient of NAWM abnormalities occurs in normal aging and other neurological diseases.
Methods
A total of 290 Alzheimer’s disease, 262 Parkinson’s disease, 154 cerebral small vessel disease, 212 multiple sclerosis, as well as 344 younger healthy controls (HCs), 344 middle-aged HCs, and 398 older HCs with available MR diffusion images were included in this study. The periventricular gradient (the slope of regression model) in NAWM of normalized neurite density (NDI) and orientation dispersion indices (ODI), derived from diffusion MRI, was calculated using linear mixed models. Its associations with other MRI measures, clinical variables, and brain-wide gene expression were analyzed. Additional sensitivity and replication analyses were conducted.
Results
The periventricular gradients of both normalized NDI and ODI were observed in older HCs and all neurological disease groups. Such periventricular gradients play mediating roles between choroid plexus volume (a marker of neuroinflammation) and NAWM NDI or ODI, white matter hyperintensity volume, white and gray matter volumes, especially in neurological diseases. They exhibited both direct and indirect associations with cognitive and physical performance in normal aging and multiple neurological diseases. We observed correlations between periventricular gradients and underlying inflammatory, endothelial and synaptic gene expression. Sensitivity and replication analyses confirmed the main findings.
Conclusion
Clinically relevant periventricular gradients in tissue diffusion characteristics occur in normal aging and multiple neurological diseases, and share some underlying pathological mechanisms.

Abstract: Iron homeostasis plays a critical role in brain function and mental health, yet its dysregulation in specific psychiatric conditions remains underexplored. In this article, we propose iron accumulation in the brains of individuals with misophonia—a condition characterized by intense emotional and physiological reactions to specific human-generated sounds. Based on the known involvement of the mirror neuron system in misophonia, we hypothesize that excessive iron concentration in the mirror motor cortex is a result of abnormal hyperactivity in this region. We propose that chronic overactivation of mirror motor cortex leads to increased metabolic demand and elevated cerebral blood flow, facilitating excessive iron influx. This may trigger low-grade chronic neuroinflammation, promoting maladaptive synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation. The resulting impaired inhibitory control and heightened functional connectivity with primary sensory areas may further exacerbate hyper-mirroring. We propose future studies should confirm the existence of this self-perpetuating cycle which would imply that interventions aimed at reducing mirror system hyperactivity could disrupt this cycle and offer a promising therapeutic strategy for misophonia.

Abstract: Purpose
To review the role of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to explore the therapeutic opportunities of iron chelators in mitigating ferroptosis-driven lung injury.
Methods
We performed a structured search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to Dec 31, 2024, using the terms “ferroptosis,” “iron homeostasis,” “iron chelators,” “lipid peroxidation,” and “COPD.” Of the 86 records identified, 45 met the predefined criteria (relevance to pulmonary iron metabolism, ferroptotic mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions) and were included in the narrative synthesis.
Results
Dysregulated iron handling in COPD leads to increased labile iron pools in airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, promoting Fenton chemistry, reactive oxygen species generation, and lipid peroxidation cascades, which trigger ferroptosis. Classical iron chelators, such as deferoxamine, deferiprone, and deferasirox, have shown efficacy in preclinical models by sequestering redox-active iron and preserving mitochondrial integrity. Novel synthetic chelators and nanoparticle-based delivery systems offer lung-specific iron removal with improved safety. The integration of trace-element biomarkers, including serum ferritin, hepcidin, transferrin saturation, and lipid peroxidation products, provides potential tools for patient stratification and therapy monitoring.
Conclusion
Targeting iron dysregulation and ferroptosis through advanced chelation strategies holds promise as a novel therapeutic approach for COPD. Combining mechanistic insights with precision delivery technologies may enhance treatment efficacy and improve clinical outcomes by mitigating iron-driven oxidative lung injuries.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Understanding trends in healthcare utilisation is key to policy and planning, especially after a prolonged pandemic that led to shutdowns of services in many societal sectors. The aim of this study is to provide comprehensive, cross-country evidence on long-term outpatient care trajectories for the older population in Europe.
Methods
We used longitudinal data from 147,116 individuals aged 50 years or older in 27 European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We divided the data into three phases: pre-pandemic (2004–2019), pandemic (2021; 2020 excluded due to changes in data collection), and post-pandemic (2022). We used a Bayesian spatiotemporal model to analyse the number of outpatient healthcare visits by sex (male/female) over time and to establish their association with age and chronic conditions.
Findings
From 2004 to 2019, the rate of outpatient healthcare visits for a reference individual (defined as 75 years old with no chronic conditions) varied more than threefold across European countries: For men, visits were lowest in Sweden in 2004, with 1.52 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 1.45–1.61] visits, and highest in Luxembourg in 2019, with 4.62 [4.30–4.90] visits. For women, visits were also lowest in Sweden in 2004 (1.82 [1.74–1.89]) and highest in Luxembourg in 2019 (5.60 [5.20–5.97]). During COVID-19, healthcare visits of men ranged between 0.06 [0.06–0.07] in Italy and 0.45 [0.41–0.49] in Germany, relative to the rate expected without the pandemic. For women, the relative rate ranged between 0.05 [0.05–0.06] in Italy and 0.42 [0.39–0.45] in Germany. Relative reductions were larger for older adults and those with chronic conditions. After COVID-19, the rates of outpatient healthcare visits mostly returned to pre-pandemic levels, but they remained significantly lower for individuals with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and chronic lung disease.
Interpretation
We show that outpatient healthcare visits for older adults in most European countries declined substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, but have since then mostly recovered back to their pre-pandemic levels. An important exception to the general recovery of healthcare visits after the pandemic is people living with chronic conditions, who have continued to utilise healthcare at lower levels than in the pre-pandemic era. Policy innovations are needed to ensure that chronic disease patients re-engage with care after major health systems disruptions.

Abstract: There is growing evidence of the involvement of gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relationship between gut microbiota and prion diseases is not yet well understood. Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and animals and caused by an infectious misfolded protein known as prion. Among prion diseases, scrapie is the one affecting sheep and goats, and its classical form is typically acquired. In the present work, a 16S rRNA-based microbiome profiling was performed in faecal samples from 10 sheep infected with classical scrapie and 10 control sheep. The phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes appeared as the most abundant phyla in scrapie and control sheep. Moreover, both groups of samples showed similar richness and alpha diversity indices. The gut microbiota profile in terms of beta diversity was significantly different in scrapie-infected sheep compared to the control group. Additionally, similarly to other neurodegenerative diseases, scrapie animals displayed a significant increased abundance of Cyanobacteria and Lentisphaerae phyla. Our results point to an altered gut microbiota in sheep infected with classical scrapie, with a specific increase of two phyla that could be involved in scrapie disease pathogenesis, enabling conceptual advances in the understanding of prion diseases.

Asynchronous Co-Culture Enhances Neuronal Differentiation in CRISPR/Cas9-Engineered NURR1 Reporter Induced Neural Stem Cells,

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, resulting in severe motor impairments. Stem cell-based neurorestorative therapies present considerable therapeutic promise; however, major challenges remain, such as variability in lineage specification, limited long-term graft survival, and the absence of effective real-time techniques to monitor differentiation processes. Overcoming these obstacles necessitates innovative strategies to address cellular heterogeneity and enhance the efficacy of neurorestorative interventions.
Methods
We engineered a NURR1-driven dopaminergic reporter in induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of ZsGreen. The differentiation capacity of reporter iNSCs was validated via in vitro spontaneous differentiation. Transcriptomic profiling was performed to compare fluorescence-sorted differentiation-committed (ZsGreen+) and non-committed (ZsGreen–) subpopulations with biological triplicates. To enhance neuronal differentiation efficiency, we developed a stage-specific asynchronous co-culture system that combined early-stage (day 5) and mid-stage (day 8) differentiating iNSC populations. Optimized iNSC-derived dopaminergic precursors were transplanted into striatum of sixteen male SCID-Beige mice (6–8 weeks old), which were randomly assigned to two groups: one receiving co-cultured cells (n = 8) and the other receiving non-co-cultured cells (n = 8). Graft survival and differentiation were subsequently assessed.
Results
The reporter system allowed real-time tracking of dopaminergic differentiation from iNSCs without affecting their differentiation potential. Transcriptome analysis showed specific activation of neurorestorative pathways in ZsGreen+ cells, including processes such as neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, axonal guidance, and cell projection organization. Asynchronous co-culture markedly enhanced the neuronal yield from iNSC-derived dopaminergic precursors compared with standard approaches. Transplantation in vivo confirmed stable engraftment and differentiation into TH-positive cells within the host striatal tissue.
Conclusion
The NURR1-ZsGreen reporter system provides a functional platform to resolve lineage specification heterogeneity and optimize differentiation protocols. The identified neurorestorative pathways, together with the asynchronous co-culture strategy, collectively address critical barriers in cell replacement-based neurorestorative therapy.

Abstract: Standard treatment for Parkinson’s disease (PD) is dopamine replacement therapy with L-DOPA. However, chronic treatment often results in abnormal involuntary movements called L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Prior evidence indicates that heightened striatal cholinergic tone may contribute to LID. Restoring cholinergic inhibition by targeting the inhibitory M4 muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (M4) reduces LID in preclinical models. Although intrinsic striatal sources of ACh have been considered for their role in LID, extrinsic sources of ACh such as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) have not been well investigated for their role in LID. Therefore, the current study employed hemiparkinsonian Long-Evans rats with a PPN-targeted cannula ipsilateral to 6-OHDA lesion. We examined the effect of local unilateral PPN infusion of M4 PAM VU0467154 on LID, motor performance, and c-fos expression within the PPN. It was expected that PPN infusion of VU0467154 would reduce LID, reduce L-DOPA’s motor benefit, and globally reduce c-fos expression in the PPN. Contrary to our expectations, PPN infusion of M4 PAM did not significantly affect LID severity. Furthermore, M4 PAM did not alter L-DOPA-mediated motor improvement, and decreased c-fos expression specifically in PPN cholinergic neurons. These results suggest that local PPN ACh dynamics differ from those of the striatum. In the context of prior work, our results suggest that PPN cholinergic modulation or global PPN modulation may be a promising strategy for altering freezing of gait without decreasing motor benefit of L-DOPA and without increasing LID severity.

Abstract: SUMMARY
Objectives
To describe the clinical evaluation process for patients with Parkinson disease (PD)-related dysphonia at an academic voice center, including potential delays in voice therapy initiation, the incidence of lesions at the time of screening laryngoscopy, and the frequency of procedural voice interventions.
Methods
Retrospective single-institution chart review of patients (n = 113) with PD-related dysphonia seen in consultation by a fellowship-trained laryngologist and speech language pathologist (SLP) between 2014 and 2024 who underwent either SPEAK OUT!® or Lee Silverman Voice Treatment®. Sociodemographic information, referral/clinical encounter dates, medical history, laryngoscopy findings, and details regarding procedural interventions were collected.
Results
Thirty-three patients satisfied inclusion criteria, including those who underwent appropriate laryngologist clearance prior to voice therapy (n = 29) and those who saw a laryngologist following treatment initiation in delayed fashion (n = 4). Time from SLP intake to therapy initiation occurred approximately 2 months sooner when patients did not see a laryngologist prior to treatment (mean 46 days versus 117 days, P < 0.05.) Screening laryngoscopy findings and voice-directed interventions ultimately performed did not significantly differ between cohorts.
Conclusion
Requiring laryngology consultation for screening laryngoscopy prior to PD-directed voice therapy can delay care without affecting the procedural interventions ultimately performed. While all patients with PD-related dysphonia should undergo laryngoscopy at some time during treatment, these patients may benefit from timelier therapy if preceding medical clearance from laryngology is not required. Regardless of the timing of laryngologist consultation, select patients with PD may benefit from voice-directed interventions, and this warrants further study.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss, associated with α-synuclein aggregation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Flavonoids, a diverse class of plant-derived polyphenols, exhibit potent antioxidant and neuroprotective properties that may reduce these pathological processes. By activating the Nrf2 pathway, reducing oxidative stress, modulating neuroinflammation, and preventing α-synuclein aggregation, flavonoids offer promising therapeutic potential in PD. This review explores their molecular mechanisms of action, summarizes key findings from preclinical and clinical studies, and discusses challenges such as limited bioavailability. Advancing our understanding of flavonoid-based activities may facilitate the development of novel antioxidant therapies for PD prevention and treatment.

The potential role of misfolded wild-type SOD1 protein in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): a review of the evidence,

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the selective loss of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. In 1993, the first ALS-linked gene mutations were identified in the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, which account for approximately 20 % of familial ALS cases. The mechanism of toxicity in this subset of patients is thought to arise from a gain-of-toxic function from the protein's propensity to misfold and aggregate into cytoplasmic inclusions. Immunohistochemical studies have shown that misfolded wildtype SOD1 (wtSOD1) is also detected in the motor neurons and glial cells of ALS patients without SOD1 mutations. It is proposed that disrupted, or aberrant, posttranslational modifications cause wtSOD1 to adopt a toxic conformation similar to that of the mutant protein. Subsequent mechanistic studies have shown that this misfolded wtSOD1 can disrupt cellular function and lead to motor neuron death through pathways similar to those observed in mutant SOD1-ALS. Given the limited neuroprotective treatments currently available that can effectively slow or reverse disease progression, targeting a pathogenic mechanism that features in both familial and sporadic ALS cases represents a promising therapeutic approach for a broader patient population. This review examines the growing body of evidence that supports or challenges the role of misfolded wtSOD1 in the pathophysiology of sporadic ALS and explores the potential implications of this mechanism in disease progression. Understanding how misfolded wtSOD1 contributes to disease pathogenesis provides new opportunities for developing more widely available treatments for this devastating disease.

Abstract: Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cognitive impairment are high incidence epidemics worldwide and are recognized as comorbidities. Ursolic acid (UA) is considered as a potential therapy for diabetic cognitive impairment due to its neuroprotective effect. This study focused on the therapeutic efficacy and possible mechanisms of UA in restoring cognitive function in T2DM mice.
Methods
C57BL/6 male mice were fed with high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin to establish a T2DM model, and then were treated with UA or vehicle by oral administration for 21 days. The cognitive performance was determined using the T-maze test and novel object recognition test. The levels of complement C3, C3aR, GSK3β, neuronal damage, GFAP, Iba-1, pathological tau and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α in prefrontal cortex of the T2DM mice were evaluated by western blot, tissue staining, or ELISA. The effect of UA on high glucose-induced cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay, and the effects of UA on proinflammatory cytokines and C3 were detected by ELISA and western blot.
Results
We showed that administration of UA prevented neuronal damage, neuroinflammation and tau hyperphosphorylation by suppressing C3-C3aR-GSK3β axis, resulting in a significant improvement of cognition in T2DM mice. UA inhibited C3 expression and lowered the production of proinflammatory cytokines to resist high glucose induced cytotoxicity in vitro.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that UA supplements have cognitive protective effects on the T2DM mouse model and may be a promising candidate drug for cognitive impairment.

Abstract: Neuroinflammation induced by intermittent hypoxia (IH) plays an essential role in the cognitive impairment associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It has been reported that the activation of Vitamin D receptor (VDR) can alleviate the neuroinflammation and neuronal injury in some neurodegenerative diseases However, it remains unknown whether VDR can play a similar role in OSA-related cognitive impairment and how it works. This study found that activating VDR by calcitriol enhanced the expression of triggering receptor on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), promoted microglia M2 polarization, further mitigated neuroinflammation and neuronal damage induced by IH in mice and in BV2 cells. These improvements were attenuated in BV2 cells exposed to IH with calcitriol when TREM2 was knockdown. To determine how VDR regulated the expression of TREM2, potential binding sites between VDR and TREM2 promoter were identified in HEK293T cells. These results indicated that the activation of VDR could ameliorate IH-induced cognitive impairment by binding to TREM2 promoter region and promoting the transcription of TREM2. This study provides a potential therapeutic target for cognitive impairment in patients with OSA.

Abstract: Replicating the in vitro properties of tissue barriers—such as the blood-brain barrier, gut, skin, lung, kidney, retina, nasal epithelium, and placenta—is crucial for many applications, including drug screening, studying molecular transport, drug delivery, and disease modeling in preclinical studies. Organ-on-a-chip (OoC) platforms are advanced three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models that aim to replicate various aspects of organ functionality within microfluidic systems by providing microenvironments akin to native tissue. When used to model the interface between two different tissue compartments, OoC technology offers a promising platform for more accurately replicating the physiology and pathophysiology of various tissue barriers in the body. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art biomimetic tissue barrier models, ranging from two-channel tissue barrier-on-a-chip systems with a thin porous membrane to hydrogel-based membrane models. Specifically, it explores the engineering of tissue barrier-on-a-chip platforms, highlighting various fabrication techniques for microfluidic chips and membranes, as well as methods for functional characterization of the engineered barriers. Additionally, we discuss the development of organ-specific barrier models and multi-organ-on-a-chip systems for studying inter-organ communication. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in the field and future directions in advancing tissue barrier modeling using OoC technology.

Abstract: A series of the p-(arylsulfonyl)benzaldehydes was synthesized to study their enzyme inhibitory properties targeting tyrosinase, lipoxygenase-15 (LOX-15) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). All of these biochemical targets are implicated in the onset and/or progression of chronic inflammation-linked diseases and oxidative stress such as hyperpigmentary disorders in human skin, cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. Except for the 4-(trifluoromethylphenyl)sulfonyl derivative 3g (IC50 = 26.38 ± 0.03 µM) all of the other test compounds exhibited superior inhibitory effect against tyrosinase compared to kojic acid (IC50 = 24.25 ± 0.14 µM) with the IC50 values in the range 3.82 ± 0.03 – 19.38 ± 0.05 µM. Compounds 3a–f exhibited dual inhibitory effect against tyrosinase and either LOX-15 or iNOS. The test compounds exhibited reduced cytotoxicity against the human embryo kidney derived Hek293-T cell compared to the clinical drug, doxorubicin, at the concentrations tested. The formylphenyl and arylsulfonyl rings are predicted to engage in hydrophobic and π-π stacking and/or T-shaped interactions with hydrophobic pockets of the test enzymes.

Abstract: Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) provides a new direction for fluorescence, but dyes with AIE properties are mostly organic molecules with poor water solubility. Herein, a novel dual fluorescence emitting nanoprobe (named as CCZ) was developed by co-loading blue emitting copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) and yellow emitting curcumin (CUR) into ZIF framework for visual detection of ATP. The prepared CuNCs are featured with good water solubility, bright blue fluorescence, and AIE property. After encapsulation within ZIF-8, CuNCs@ZIF can obviously increase the fluorescence quantum yield (10.15 %), fluorescence intensity (4.29 times that of pure CuNCs), and fluorescence stability (only 10 % fluorescence decay after seven days sunlight). Based on the stronger coordination between ATP and Zn2+, a novel dual fluorescence responsive probe CCZ was constructed by loading curcumin to perform ratio fluorescence combined with colorimetric dual-mode detection of ATP, with the limit of detection (LOD) of 7.5 μM and 0.2 μM, respectively, presenting high specificity for ATP. More interestingly, it could achieve naked eye semi-quantitative sensing of ATP based on the color change, showing great potentials for application in the detection of real samples.

Abstract: Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling psychiatric disorder worldwide, yet current treatments are limited by delayed onset and suboptimal response rates. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), a ligand-gated cation channel within the central cholinergic system, is highly expressed in emotion-regulating regions including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, where it modulates neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation. Accumulating preclinical evidence indicates that α7 nAChR activation may exert antidepressant-like effects by modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission, enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, attenuating microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine release, and engaging gut–brain-axis pathways. Nevertheless, heterogeneous findings, target-engagement hurdles, and a paucity of adequately powered clinical studies have limited translation to the clinic. This review systematically summarizes the structural features, mechanistic insights, and therapeutic advances of α7 nAChR in depression, with the aim of providing a theoretical basis and future directions for targeted interventions and novel drug discovery.

Abstract: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used in industrial and biomedical applications owing to their superior physicochemical properties, especially antimicrobial activity. However, their potential health risks raise concerns. Given that the central nervous system (CNS) is a major target of AgNPs, assessing their neurotoxic effects is critical for safety evaluation. Recent studies suggest that ferroptosis may play a pivotal role in AgNPs-induced neurotoxicity, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study is the first to investigate AgNPs-triggered ferroptosis in human microglial cells (HMC3) and explore the regulatory role of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)-mediated inflammatory responses. Following exposure to AgNPs (0, 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL) for 48 h, HMC3 cells exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity. Further analyses revealed mitochondrial ultrastructural and functional damage, intracellular Fe²⁺ overload, elevated ROS levels, GSH depletion, and increased lipid peroxidation, accompanied by dysregulated expression of ferroptosis-related proteins. Inflammatory profiling demonstrated reduced TREM2 protein levels, elevated pro-inflammatory markers, and decreased anti-inflammatory markers, indicating AgNPs-induced inflammatory responses. Treatment with the TREM2 agonist COG 1410 (5 μg/mL) significantly upregulated TREM2 expression, attenuated pro-inflammatory factors, and enhanced anti-inflammatory factors. Moreover, TREM2 activation significantly inhibited AgNPs-induced ferroptosis in HMC3 cells, indicating that TREM2-mediated inflammation may play a key role in regulating this process. These findings offer new understanding of AgNPs neurotoxicity and potential therapeutic targets for reducing CNS damage from AgNPs exposure.

Abstract: Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a class of hereditary metabolic disorders primarily caused by lysosomal enzyme defects, leading to the accumulation of undegraded substrates. Sphingolipidoses, a subset of LSDs, are primarily associated with profound involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by progressive neurodegeneration due to massive sphingolipid accumulation. A common pathological feature among many CNS-involved LSDs is the early activation of microglia and astrocytes, which often precedes and predicts regions of subsequent neuronal loss. The extent to which neuroinflammation disrupts CNS homeostasis appears to be determined by its onset, magnitude, and duration. Although neuroinflammatory processes are increasingly recognized as critical contributors to disease progression in sphingolipidoses, the molecular mechanisms underlying glial activation and the initiation of inflammatory cascades remain incompletely understood. Therefore, mouse models of sphingolipidoses have been instrumental in elucidating these pathogenic processes and provide valuable platforms for evaluating therapeutic strategies. This review critically examines the role of neuroinflammation in sphingolipidoses, summarizes insights derived from pre-clinical models, and discusses the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory interventions to mitigate CNS pathology and improve clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Background
Carpometacarpal osteoarthritis is a common condition that leads to declines in hand dexterity. The Corbett Targeted Coin Test measures dexterity with palm-to-finger translation and proprioceptive target placement, but lacks established norms for the carpometacarpal osteoarthritis population and post carpometacarpal osteoarthritis suture suspension arthroplasty.
Purpose
To determine the Corbett Targeted Coin Test norms for patients with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis that are surgical candidates, as well as Corbett Targeted Coin Test norms and outcomes following carpometacarpal osteoarthritis suture suspension arthroplasty.
Study Design
Clinical measurement of a retrospective cohort.
Methods
Subjects were diagnosed with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis, had carpometacarpal suture suspension arthroplasty, and were assessed preoperatively and 12 weeks postoperatively.
Results
Prior to surgery, the patients with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis that were surgical candidates demonstrated a mean Corbett Targeted Coin Test quality of performance score of 53.4 (range 28-90). A total of 31 participants (22 females, nine males) underwent thumb carpometacarpal suture suspension arthroplasty. On average, there were 7.1 therapy visits (range 4-10) and the average age was 66.6years (51-81years). Outcome measures following suture suspension arthroplasty 12weeks postoperatively demonstrated both statistically and clinically significant improvements in pain reduction (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), QuickDASH scores, and Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation scores. There was also a clinically significant improvement in grip strength. Corbett Targeted Coin Test scores improved with a mean quality of performance score of 47.3 (range 20-73) but did not correlate with other outcome measures.
Conclusions
Patients with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis had higher quality of performance scores, indicating a slower and/or less accurate dexterity performance compared with the normal population. At 12weeks post suture suspension arthroplasty, the Corbett Targeted Coin Test scores improved 11.4%, and there were statistically and clinically significant improvements in pain reduction (Numeric Pain Rating Scale), QuickDASH, Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation, and a clinically significant improvement in grip strength.

Abstract: Purpose
In Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) the size of the smaller GAA expansion is a major determinant of disease severity; interruption motifs were identified after the discovery of the pathogenic expansions, but their impact only recently investigated.
Methods
164 FRDA patients with biallelic expansions, and 15 non-FRDA patients were analyzed for interruption(s) number, position, and motif. Expansion size and age at onset of ataxia (AAO) were determined for FRDA patients.
Results
Three groups of FRDA patients were identified by the simultaneous analysis of the precise distance (“depth”) between the interruptions (mostly non-triplet) and the 3’ end of the expansion (P < 0.001), the smaller expansion size (P < 0.001), and AAO (P < 0.001). Classical FRDA corresponds to absence of interruption or interruption depth <8 repeats, with AAO often < 15 years (AUC = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96); LOFA to interruption depth of 8-18 repeats (AUC = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-1), with AAO 15-34 years (AUC = 1; 95% CI, 1-1); vLOFA to interruption depth > 18 (AUC = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92-1) and AAO >34 years. Multiple (>5) triplet interruptions hamper further expansion.
Conclusion
This study provides the molecular basis for a novel classification of FRDA that should be recommended for correct diagnosis.

Abstract: Neonatal bilirubin encephalopathy is primarily characterized by central auditory dysfunction and cognitive impairments. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Using kinase activity prediction tools based on quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identified ROCK2 (Rho-associated protein kinase 2) as a critical kinase regulating the phosphorylation of proteins associated with bilirubin exposure. Molecular docking and MicroScale Thermophoresis assays revealed a strong binding affinity between bilirubin and ROCK2. Interestingly, bilirubin increased ROCK2 protein expression without affecting its mRNA levels, and cycloheximide chase assays revealed enhanced ROCK2 stability, implicating post-translational regulation. While bilirubin did not directly activate ROCK2 kinase activity in vitro, it elevated phosphorylation of its substrate LIMK1, suggesting that ROCK2 accumulation amplifies downstream signaling. In primary rat neurons, ROCK2 inhibitors (Belumosudil and Y-27632) ameliorated bilirubin-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and neuronal cell death. Furthermore, using ROCK2 inhibitors and Rock2+/− mice, we demonstrated that modulation of ROCK2 significantly alleviated bilirubin-induced auditory deficits and cognitive impairments. These behavioral improvements were linked to restored excitatory synaptic transmission in the cochlear nucleus and reduced dendritic damage in hippocampal neurons. These findings position ROCK2 as a promising molecular target for therapeutic intervention in bilirubin encephalopathy.

Abstract: Auditory-motor integration is crucial for speech production, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood in individuals with aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke. This study utilized event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the neural correlates of speech production and auditory feedback control under a formant alteration paradigm in aphasia. A total of 20 participants with post-stroke aphasia and 22 controls performed a mono-syllabic word production task under randomized normal (i.e. no shift) and altered auditory feedback (AAF) trials by applying a +30% shift to the first formant (F1) frequency during concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. The analysis of pre-speech ERPs (readiness potentials) did not reveal any neural activity differences between and within groups. However, we found that the aphasia group exhibited significantly smaller ERP amplitudes compared with controls irrespective of auditory feedback condition following the onset of speech production. In addition, post-speech ERPs were significantly larger in the anterior vs. posterior regions in controls, but no such difference was present in the aphasia group. Moreover, no laterality effect was observed, suggesting a bilateral distribution of neural activities in both groups. Finally, the AAF did not elicit any between-group ERP differences, and this effect was consistent with behavioral compensatory responses to formant alterations. These findings highlight reduced articulatory neural responsiveness in aphasia, particularly in the anterior cortical regions implicated in speech production and motor control. The absence of the AAF effect suggests limited sensitivity to feedback alterations in both groups, potentially due to motor adaptation of underlying mechanisms over repeated formant-shifting trials.

Abstract: Poorly-crystalline metal-organic frameworks have emerged as compelling platforms for chemical sensing, attributed to their high density of defect sites, and disordered framework structures. These properties promote efficient analyte interactions, boosting fluorescence-based detection sensitivity and selectivity. We report solvothermal synthesis, characterization and fluorescence-sensing behaviour of poorly-crystalline molybdenum–itaconic acid (Mo–IA) metal-organic framework (MOF) toward dopamine and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol. DFT calculations were carried out using B3LYP functional model and 6–311++G(d.p) basis set to optimize the proposed MOF structure and evaluate its electronic and vibrational properties. In vitro cytotoxicity assay validated biocompatibility of Mo–IA, supporting its safe use in biological systems. Fluorescence sensing studies revealed Mo–IA's exceptional performance in detecting dopamine across HEPES buffer, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and water media over a wide pH range. The material demonstrated consistent, dose-dependent fluorescence enhancement with high selectivity and excellent reusability. The calculated limits of detection (LOD) for dopamine are: HEPES: 0.256 nM, PBS: 0.175 nM, and water: 0.249 nM. Mo-IA exhibits stable sensing performance across acidic and strongly basic media and proves effective for dopamine detection in human serum. Its distinct color response to different dopamine concentrations offers a rapid, accessible, and cost-efficient route for real-time monitoring. Additionally, Mo–IA exhibited pronounced fluorescence quenching toward nitro explosives, particularly 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, driven by π–π interactions and photoinduced electron transfer mechanisms. The LOD for 2,4,6-trinitrophenol was found to be 1.55 × 10−5 M. This work establishes Mo–IA as a dual-functional fluorescent sensor, offering significant promise for future biomedical diagnostics and environmental safety applications.

Abstract: To investigate the potential of polyphenols in modulating gut microbiota composition and their subsequent impact on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases pose a significant global health burden. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in brain health and polyphenols, abundant in plant-based foods, possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. A comprehensive electronic search of multiple databases was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and the study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: 1139642). Studies investigating the impact of polyphenol interventions on gut microbiota composition and their potential influence on neurodegenerative disease progression were included. Polyphenols, including curcumin and resveratrol, demonstrate the potential to modulate gut microbiota composition, promoting beneficial bacteria and suppressing pathogenic strains. This modulation can enhance gut microbial ecology, reinforce gut barrier function, reduce inflammation and increase the production of neuroprotective short-chain fatty acids(SCFAs).This systematic review highlights the promising potential of polyphenols in modulating gut microbiota for the prevention and management of neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is necessary to elucidate optimal polyphenol dosages, explore individual variations in gut microbiota composition and establish the precise mechanisms linking gut health to neuroprotection.

Abstract: Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by dysregulated host response to infection, leads to high morbidity and mortality, primarily due to sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Oxidative stress, driven by excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a central role in sepsis pathophysiology, exacerbating inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular damage in multiple organs, including the heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, brain, and skeletal muscles. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to sepsis-induced organ injury. Most current research examining the interplay between ROS, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis, are animal- or cell-based. Key signaling pathways, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 inflammasome (NLRP3), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 /heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf-2/HO-1), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), are explored as potential therapeutic targets. This review also highlights the roles of mitochondrial quality control, autophagy, and noncoding RNAs in mitigating oxidative damage.

Abstract: Background
Postoperative failure after thoracolumbar burst-fracture fixation is difficult to anticipate using imaging alone. We tested whether early inflammatory biomarkers and bone-formation markers improve risk stratification.
Methods
Prospective cohort of consecutive adults undergoing fixation for T10–L2 burst fractures with 24-month follow-up. The primary endpoint was treatment failure. Secondary endpoints were ≥10% vertebral height loss and ≥10° kyphosis progression. Biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, ESR) were measured serially. Primary analyses used the posterior-only cohort; full-cohort models adjusting for approach served as sensitivity checks. Forced-entry multivariable logistic regression quantified associations; performance was assessed with AUC and calibration. Prespecified sensitivities adjusted for infections ≤3 months and NSAID/steroid exposure near the two-week draw.
Results
Of 196 screened, 174 were analyzed (posterior-only n=138); 50/174 (28.7%) met the primary endpoint. In posterior-only patients, two-week CRP (7.8 vs 4.1 mg/L; p=0.006) and IL-6 (16.8 vs 12.5 pg/mL; p=0.028) were higher in failures. Adjusted models showed TLICS ≥ 5 (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.02–5.42), CRP ≥ 5 mg/L (OR 2.12, 1.22–3.70), and IL-6 ≥ 7 pg/mL (OR 1.63, 1.01–2.67) predicted failure; AUC = 0.75 (optimism-corrected 0.73) with good calibration. Two-week CRP/IL-6 provided peak discrimination (AUCs 0.73/0.70) and increased a baseline clinical AUC from 0.66 to 0.75. Associations persisted after infection and medication adjustments. Radiographic progression was more frequent in failures and associated with TLICS and, for height loss, CRP.
Conclusions
Two-week CRP and IL-6, combined with TLICS, identify patients at risk of postoperative treatment failure after thoracolumbar burst-fracture fixation and support biomarker-guided surveillance.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of neuroimaging technologies, the development of deep learning-based models for the analysis of mental disorders has become an emerging consensus. Graphs, as a data and relationship representative, can abstract complex brain data, enabling us to systematically and precisely reveal key issues related to brain structure and function with the support of neuroimaging techniques. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide new tools and methods for brain network analysis, allowing for a deeper exploration of the relationships between functional regions of the brain and potential functional patterns. Therefore, GNN-based methods for brain network analysis are gaining increasing attention. However, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive summary of the latest research approaches in this field from the perspective of computer science. This survey covers functional brain network analysis methods from different dimensions. In addition, for each method, we discuss the corresponding open challenges and unmet needs to identify the limitations and future directions of these methods in brain network research. Finally, to facilitate researchers in selecting and applying appropriate brain network datasets for experimentation and validation, we summarize the characteristics and sources of various brain network analysis datasets.

Abstract: From shaping Earth's earliest anoxic seas to quietly orchestrating cellular life today, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has journeyed from ancient toxin to modern therapeutic candidate. Once abundant in Earth's primordial environment, H2S has reemerged as a critical endogenous gasotransmitter in modern biology. Within the central nervous system, H2S regulates redox homeostasis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, inflammatory signalling, and neuronal excitability. A key mechanism involves post-translational modification of protein cysteine residues (persulfidation), reactions with metal centres, and scavenging of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, thereby influencing diverse cellular processes. Dysregulation of H2S metabolism, whether deficient or excessive, is increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's disease, Down syndrome, and in stroke and traumatic brain injury. This review focuses on neuronal aspects of H2S biology and therapeutic relevance in these conditions. Restoration of H2S signalling in preclinical models improves cognitive and motor function, reduces neuropathology, and preserves mitochondrial integrity. Therapeutic innovation has produced a variety of H2S donors, including slow-releasing compounds, organelle-targeted agents, and emerging nanomaterial platforms such as polymer-based and metal–organic frameworks for precision CNS delivery. Natural compounds such as ergothioneine, a sulfur-containing antioxidant, are also gaining attention as potential modulators of endogenous H2S pathways. Future directions include integration of H2S therapies with genetic targeting tools and elucidation of their interactions with other gasotransmitters and gut–brain axis signalling. Although clinical trials remain limited, the convergence of donor chemistry, molecular biology, and delivery technologies positions H2S-based therapeutics as a promising frontier for treating neurodegeneration and acute neural injuries.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-β and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated tau protein. In sporadic AD, the distribution of pathological tau progresses in a stereotypical manner and correlates with clinical staging, whereas the distribution of amyloid-β plaques does not. This suggests that the spread of tau pathology is a critical process that plays a key role in neurodegeneration and disease progression. Accurate models of tau propagation are therefore necessary to develop disease-modifying drugs for AD. The prion-like propagation hypothesis is a potential mechanism for the progressive distribution of tau pathology in the brain. In 2009, it was experimentally demonstrated that the intracerebral injection of brain extracts from transgenic mice that overexpress a mutated form of human tau protein into other tau transgenic mice induced the spread of pathological tau in vivo. Since then, this approach has been widely used to model tau propagation. More recently, newer models that more closely replicate the pathology of AD have been developed. This review summarizes the latest developments in animal models of tau propagation in sporadic AD.

Abstract: Summary
Ubiquitin is a conserved modifier regulating the stability and function of numerous target proteins. In all eukaryotes, polyubiquitin precursors are generated and processed into ubiquitin monomers. The final ubiquitin unit always contains a C-terminal extension, but its physiological significance is unknown. Here, we show that C-terminally extended ubiquitin, termed CxUb, is essential for stress resistance, mitophagy, and longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. CxUb forms ubiquitin chains and binds to a previously undescribed region within the ubiquitin chain-elongating E4 enzyme Ufd2, which also functions during stress and aging. Ufd2 recognizes CxUb and conjugates it to substrate proteins, triggering their degradation. By contrast, CxUb is not required for basal housekeeping functions of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These data suggest that the CxUb encodes a functionally unique ubiquitin form, specialized for proteostasis defects, expanding the code of post-translational modification processes.

Abstract: The glymphatic system is an essential component in modulating brain health and clearing out toxins from the central nervous system (CNS). The glymphatic system, especially the perivascular space, undergoes significant alterations during CNS inflammation. Various cerebrovascular disorders have implicated glymphatic dysfunction as the major contributing factor for cerebral edema, neuroinflammation, as well as damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a major life-threatening stroke subtype with limited therapies available. ICH results from the rupture of cerebral arteries, accumulation of the blood and hematoma formation in the brain parenchyma. The toxic degradation components from the hematoma further exacerbates the oxidative stress, inflammatory response and cerebral edema, worsening the BBB disruption as well as the neurological outcomes post-ICH. Thus, making it imperative to understand the underlying mechanisms of secondary brain injury (SBI) and create targeted therapeutic strategies to improve patient recovery. Owing to the involvement of the glymphatic system in clearing out debris, it may contribute in alleviating SBI following ICH. In this review we intend to gain a better understanding of the glymphatic system’s role in mitigating SBI as well as potential therapeutic approaches that target this system to improve patient recovery and reduce damage post-ICH.

Abstract: The neurobiological correlates of nature exposure in children and youth, from primary school students to undergraduates, remain poorly understood. This article aims to bridge this gap by conducting a systematic review, targeting studies that investigated the impact of any form of nature exposure on the brain and/or peripheral nervous system in neurotypical individuals aged under 25. A total of 26 articles were retrieved following a search using PRISMA guidelines through the Children & Nature Network Research Library, APA PsycNet, Scopus, CINAHL, EMBASE and Medline databases. Except for brain structure outcomes, the studies were analyzed depending on whether measurements were conducted in exposure-only conditions or in exposure plus physical or cognitive task conditions. We found that nature exposure in children and youth was associated with changes in brain structure, specifically increased prefrontal cortex grey matter volume. In exposure-only conditions, peripheral nervous system activity and brain activity were associated with a "relaxed yet alert" state, as reflected by lower sympathetic activity, higher parasympathetic activity, a decrease in prefrontal cortex activity and brain waves with the exception of beta power which increases, when compared to urban or indoors conditions. In exposure plus physical task engagement, brain activity was also associated with relaxed and meditative states. Nature exposure plus cognitive task engagement was associated with an increase in brain activity, which reflects improvements in attentional processing and cognitive resource allocation. These findings support the use of nature-based learning beyond pre-K and primary education until the age of 25, as older teenagers and young adults might also experience learning benefits due to nature exposure.

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural circuits within the brain requires advanced tools capable of simultaneously recording signals from multiple regions and depths. However, previously developed tools have limited capability to address 3D structures in the brain as they typically feature fixed probe lengths and single-sided electrode configurations. To overcome these challenges, we developed a depth-customizable 3D electrode array structure comprising double-sided 2D neural probe arrays via flexible printed circuit board technology with a zero-insertion-force connector and a supporting board without requiring additional fabrication steps. This enables precise depth adjustments and the double-sided electrode configuration effectively doubles the number of recording sites, thereby facilitating volumetric and comprehensive neural signal acquisition. Our device allows user-defined adjustment of probe spacing, achieving a minimum inter-probe distance of 1 mm, and enables fine-tuned control of insertion depth for precise targeting of specific brain regions, with a maximum depth difference of only 0.168 mm. Also, by employing a PSR ink insulation layer, we achieved a total probe thickness of approximately 80 µm, resulting in a compact design that eliminates the need for complex semiconductor processes. Validation of the device in vivo demonstrated its capability to simultaneously monitor neural signals from multiple brain regions. Its depth-customizable design facilitated functional connectivity studies across various depths, the results of which could provide critical insights into neural network dynamics. Our approach significantly enhances the flexibility, scalability, and efficiency of neural probes and provides a powerful platform for neuroscience research into areas such as brain-machine interface development and functional connectivity.

Abstract: Oxindoles are a structurally unique subclass of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) with significant medicinal values such as neuroprotective and anticancer properties and are predominantly found in the Rubiaceae plant family. Recent research has only just begun to uncover the biosynthetic pathways of this complex MIA subclass. Here, we report the discovery, characterization, and functional reconstitution of a four-enzyme pathway from Cephalanthus occidentalis (button bush) that enables the complete de novo biosynthesis of heteroyohimbine-type oxindole alkaloids in engineered yeast. Through transcriptomic mining and biochemical validation, we identified and characterized an ajmalicine synthase (CoAJS), a heteroyohimbine/yohimbine/corynanthe C3-oxidase (CoHYC3O), a C3-reductase (CoHYC3R), and an oxindole synthase (CoOIS) capable of converting strictosidine aglycone into 3-epi-ajmalicine and subsequently into the oxindole alkaloids mitraphylline and isomitraphylline. Saturation kinetics of CoOIS revealed comparable catalytic efficiencies for 3-epi-ajmalicine and its C20 epimer akuammigine, indicating substrate tolerance within the heteroyohimbine subclass. Yeast-based reconstruction of the pathway successfully yielded both mitraphylline epimers and the spirooxindole uncarine F. This work elucidates the enzymatic logic behind oxindole formation and expands the toolkit for MIA scaffold diversification and synthetic biology.

Abstract: In this paper, 2-aminobenzothiazolium chloroacetate (ABTCLA) crystallises as a monoclinic with C2/c space group elucidated by SCXRD analysis. The ABTCLA crystal was thoroughly characterized through FT-IR, NMR, and UV spectroscopy, along with TG-DTA and DSC analyses, to investigate its physicochemical and thermal properties. The molecular geometry of ABTCLA was optimized using a quantum chemical approach based on the M06-2X functional with the 6-31G** basis set. Key electronic properties, including frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), and density of states (DOS), were computed. Additionally, time-dependent DFT calculations (TD-M06-2X) were employed to analyze the electronic charge distribution in both the ground and excited states, and the results were correlated with the experimental UV-Visible absorption spectrum. Antibacterial studies of these compounds show positive result against few grams positive and gram-negative strains. The current investigation of 2-amino benzothiazolium chloroacetate (ABTCLA) crystal highlights several properties which could be a valuable compound for optoelectronic and laser applications.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic vascular disease closely associated with endothelial dysfunction. Ferroptosis, a major factor in endothelial dysfunction, plays a pivotal role in the progression of atherosclerosis. The development of drugs targeting endothelial ferroptosis offers a potential therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis. This study aimed to assess the potential impact of tetrahydroberberrubine (THBru) on atherosclerosis and unravel its molecular mechanism underlying endothelial protection. Our results demonstrated that THBru significantly reduced plaque formation in the aortas of atherosclerotic mice. Through transcriptome sequencing and further verification, we observed that THBru mitigated endothelial ferroptosis in atherosclerosis by enhancing glutathione homeostasis and decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Mechanistically, bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that THBru reduced the expression of the super-enhancer (SE) regulatory gene ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1). The transcription factor BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) was responsible for ABCC1 transcription by binding to its SE (ABCC1-SE), whereas THBru effectively inhibited the activity of ABCC1-SE. Furthermore, THBru promoted adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, thereby negatively regulating BACH1 and the downstream ABCC1/ferroptosis signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings highlight THBru as a promising candidate for treating atherosclerosis, featuring a novel mechanism that inhibits endothelial ferroptosis through the AMPK/BACH1 axis to regulate ABCC1-SE.

Abstract: Myelin pathology in demyelinating diseases is accompanied by lipid remodeling that remains challenging to characterize at spatial level using traditional mass spectrometry. We developed an optimized AP-MALDI-Orbitrap MSI pipeline, incorporating sample preparation improvements and mass recalibration, to investigate lipid dynamics in the cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of demyelination. Dual-modality, untargeted lipid profiling was performed to map spatially resolved lipid alterations during demyelination and spontaneous remyelination in two key brain areas of male mice: corpus callosum (CC) and cortex (Ctx), with lipid identifications benchmarked against 4D-LC-TIMS-MS/MS. Demyelinated regions were identified using Black Gold II staining. Using 1 ppm mass tolerance, we annotated 154 and 133 lipids at the sum-composition level in CC and Ctx, respectively, with 60% validated by LC-MS/MS. Spatial lipid profiling revealed CPZ-induced alterations in sphingolipids, sulfatides, and glycerophospholipids, supported by reanalysis of a published snRNA-seq dataset from a mouse CPZ model. Long-chain ceramides (Cer) and hexosylceramides (HexCer) were reduced in demyelinated regions, with partial, region-specific recovery during remyelination. Short-chain sulfatides (SHexCer), sphingomyelins (SM) and seminolipids transiently increased in the CC during demyelination, while long-chain sulfatides decreased in both CC and Ctx. Additionally, we observed demyelination-induced upregulation of polyunsaturated glycerophospholipids in CC and phosphatidylinositols (PI) in cortex. Lipid subclass changes emerged as reliable markers of both demyelination and remyelination in the mouse brain. Region-specific alterations in lipid metabolism provide new insights into the processes of de- and remyelination. Notably, remyelinated fibers have a distinct lipid profile compared to intact myelin, suggesting that lipid-based therapeutic strategies could improve myelin repair.

Abstract: With the advances in communication technologies, remote monitoring and control of drug delivery are becoming prevalent in bio-medical engineering. In a chemotherapy system, the measurement signals can be wirelessly transferred to the control center by communication networks. Nevertheless, the avenues of communication might be jeopardized by false data injection (FDI), which poses significant risks to the security and stability of biomedical systems. In this work, a defense mechanism is developed to tackle the effect of FDI threats in the networked chemotherapy system. In particular, the effect of FDI attacks on the chemotherapy system is modeled by the Markov chain process. The proposed defense mechanism is designed in two parts: i) a data-driven sliding mode observer (DDSMO) is utilized to identify the occurrence of cyber attacks in the tumor signals measured by the bio-sensor, and ii) a mitigation scheme based on a dynamic rejection compensator (DRC) to compensate for the impact of cyber threats. In the mitigation phase, a goal representation heuristic dynamic programming (GrHDP) is adopted to adaptively adjust the parameters of DRC and to dynamically handle the cyber threats. The designed mitigation mechanism not only regulates the cancerous cells against cyber threats but also minimizes the side effects of drug delivery by regulating the output of normal cell and immune cell. Compared to prevalent methodologies, the proposed approach yields significant performance, including a 60.23 % improvement over the without protection, 37.48 % over the DDSMO-based model predictive controller (MPC), 35.95 % over the reinforcement learning (RL) based Kalman filter, and 70.44 % over the proportional integral (PI) based Kalman filter.

Abstract: Purpose
This study details the long-term clinical outcomes in adult participants with CRIM-positive infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), initially reported in 2012 (n=11).
Methods
Medical records were reviewed for multisystem involvement and biomarker trends. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement was evaluated using a Modified Fazekas Score (MFS) to grade white matter hyperintensities (WMHI) on brain MRI.
Results
Of the initial 11 participants, 8 survived to adulthood (median age 19.6 years); 3 died (2 of arrhythmia, 1 of status epilepticus). All survivors began ERT between 0.2−6 months of age (seven at 20 mg/kg biweekly; one at 40 mg/kg biweekly), with subsequent escalation to 40 mg/kg/week of alglucosidase alfa between ages 8−15 years. None received immune modulation. Cardiac hypertrophy resolved in all; two developed arrhythmias requiring intervention. None required invasive ventilation. Two participants were ambulatory, six used wheelchairs. Flaccid dysarthria (8/8), ptosis (4/8), and sensorineural hearing loss (6/8) were common. WMHI were present in all but remained mild to moderate on MFS. Cognitive function remained stable.
Conclusions
Long-term ERT preserves cardiac and respiratory function in adult IOPD survivors, but multisystem morbidity persists, highlighting the need for earlier diagnosis and better therapies targeting muscle and other tissues including the CNS.

Abstract: Background & Aims
Sarcopenic obesity (SO) represents a complex nutritional state associated with adverse health outcomes, especially in older adults. While grip strength has been extensively studied in relation to functional status, the role of pinch strength remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the associations between pinch strength parameters and different body composition phenotypes and to explore its potential role in the relationship between SO and functional status, including physical performance, cognitive function, and frailty.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 954 community-dwelling older adults, categorized into four groups: healthy controls (HC), obesity only, sarcopenia only, and SO. We assessed body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis, muscle strength (grip and pinch dynamometry), physical performance, cognitive function, and frailty. Sex-stratified correlation networks and mediation analyses were performed to elucidate relationships between body composition, muscle strength parameters, and functional status.
Results
The SO and sarcopenia groups demonstrated significantly reduced pinch strength compared to the HC and obesity groups (e.g., women: 2.2 ± 0.8 kg in SO vs. 3.5 ± 1.1 kg in HC, p<0.001), with higher pinch/grip ratios (0.20-0.25 vs. 0.15-0.20, p<0.05). Notably, the SO groups exhibited significantly greater pinch strength variability (Coefficient of Variation) in both men and women (CV for women: 18.5% in SO vs. 12.1% in HC, p<0.001), suggesting impaired neuromuscular control of fine motor function. The SO group exhibited the poorest functional performance. Mediation analyses suggested that pinch strength was a significant intermediary in the association between SO and cognitive impairment, and partially in the association with frailty in women ((indirect effect log-OR = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.12, -0.03] in women).
Conclusion
Pinch strength and its variability are strongly associated with SO and represent important markers of functional status. This finding identifies pinch strength as a potential clinically accessible biomarker for the early detection of functional decline in older adults with this double burden of malnutrition. The differential preservation of pinch versus grip strength and sex-specific potential pathways highlights the need for comprehensive hand function assessment in the nutritional and clinical evaluation of SO.

Abstract: A substantial body of research has investigated the role of syntactic complexity in gauging second language (L2) learners’ writing performance, but Malaysian Chinese-as-a-second-language (CSL) learners remain largely underexplored. This study examined the relationship between syntactic complexity and L2 Chinese proficiency in Malaysian CSL learners’ writing. Our data consisted of a corpus of 976 essays written by Malaysian CSL learners over eight consecutive semesters spanning four academic years. Each essay was analyzed using 13 syntactic complexity measures based on length, quantity and dependency distance at both global and phrasal levels. Results revealed that 12 of the 13 indices showed significant differences across four proficiency levels, with mean dependency distance of sentence having the largest effect size. Our findings contribute to the multidimensional measurement of L2 syntactic complexity, promote a more inclusive representation of learner diversity in L2 writing research, and offer valuable insights for L2 Chinese writing research and pedagogy.

Abstract: Background
There is no research exploring music therapy and physical therapy co-treatment in Huntington’s Disease (HD).
Purpose
This qualitative descriptive study describes a music therapy and physical therapy co-treatment approach for individuals with late stage HD.
Method
Ten individuals in a long-term care facility were evaluated by a Physical Therapist (PT) and Music Therapist-Board Certified (MT-BC) with a follow-up of functional movements under 3 conditions: physical therapy, physical therapy with simple rhythmic cue, and physical therapy with melodic rhythmic cue. Participant observations and semi-structured interviews with the PT and MT-BC were conducted and analyzed.
Discussion
Two themes emerged: 1) two parts make a whole (subthemes: novice versus expert, knowledge of the other, interprofessional respect, professional comfort zone), 2) symbiotic interactions (subthemes: collaborative goal-directed preparation, co-direction of intervention, co-treatment cueing).
Conclusions
This work illuminates the value of a PT and MT-BC interprofessional collaboration with the late stage HD population in long-term care and identifies key variables for patient care and future research.

Abstract: Background
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI), such as sciatic nerve injury (SNI), often results in poor functional recovery due to myelin damage, which critically impairs nerve regeneration. Prox1, a homeobox transcription factor known to influence neurogenesis, has not been studied in peripheral myelin regeneration.
Objective
To investigate morphological changes in myelin sheaths and the expression of Prox1 and MBP proteins during sciatic nerve repair, and to determine the role of Prox1 in nerve regeneration.
Methods
Mice were divided into seven groups (n = 8): one control and six experimental groups based on sciatic nerve collection at Days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14 post-injury. H&E staining, electron microscopy, Luxol Fast Blue staining, Western Blot, and immunohistochemistry were used to assess myelin morphology and Prox1/MBP expression. Immunofluorescence analyzed colocalization of Prox1 and MBP. Prox1 was overexpressed in Schwann cells via plasmid transfection, and MBP levels were measured by Western blot.
Results
Control group myelin sheaths showed normal structure, while Day 7 nerves displayed disorganized sheaths with vacuolation and axonal spacing. By Day 14, myelin structure largely recovered. MBP levels decreased from Day 3, reached a minimum at Day 7, and increased significantly by Day 14. Prox1 expression rose on Day 3, peaked on Day 7, and declined by Day 14. Prox1 and MBP colocalized in injured nerves, and Prox1 overexpression significantly increased MBP levels in Schwann cells.
Conclusion
Prox1 protein level is upregulated in injured sciatic nerve, and Prox1 overexpression promotes the increase of MBP protein level, which positively correlates to myelin regeneration in morphology. This strongly suggests that Prox1 promotes myelin regeneration of injured peripheral nerves.

Abstract: Background
Recently, several animal studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) for Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in decreasing amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques. However, clinical concerns regarding the duration of efficacy and long-term safety of this treatment remain understudied. Additionally, LDRT has been shown to alleviate various neurological disorders. We hypothesize that the therapeutic mechanisms of LDRT in AD may extend beyond targeting Aβ and tau alone. In this study, we administered whole-brain X-ray irradiation (10 Gy in 5 fractions) to presymptomatic AD mice to re-examine its mechanism of action, duration of efficacy, and long-term safety profile.
Results
Two months after irradiation, the autonomous activity of 3 × Tg-AD mice was significantly enhanced, with specific improvements in the spatial learning and memory in females. Western blotting revealed reduced tau phosphorylation at Ser262 site in the hippocampus of females. SnRNA-seq demonstrated restored neuronal network in females. However, these therapeutic effects appeared exhibited transient characteristics. By ten months post-irradiation, no significant behavioral and AD-related pathological changes were detected across groups, except for the elevated Aβ1–42 in the hippocampus of females.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the effects of early X-ray intervention on 3 × Tg-AD mice were sex-specific and time-dependent. The short-term improvement observed in female mice may be attributed to attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation and restored neuronal networks. Longitudinal observation over ten consecutive months post-irradiation showed no evidence of severe adverse effects.

Abstract: Memristor technology is heralding a paradigm shift for implantable/wearable medical devices. By synergistically integrating their intrinsic nonvolatile memory and brain-inspired computing capabilities with biocompatible materials, memristor-based devices address the fundamental bottlenecks of conventional medical electronics—namely, high power consumption, poor biocompatibility, and low signal processing efficiency. This review comprehensively explores the innovative applications of memristors in medical devices and highlights their core advantages, such as tunable resistance, nonvolatility, and excellent biocompatibility. Key advancements include: neuromorphic computing for predicting epilepsy and monitoring Parkinson's disease; flexible sensors for ultrasensitive detection of physiological signals like pressure and temperature; and implantable systems for continuous health tracking. We provide a focused analysis of how material innovations—including metal oxides, organic compounds, and two-dimensional materials—increase device performance in terms of sensitivity, stability, and environmental adaptability while addressing challenges such as device variability, biocompatibility in complex biological milieus, and large-scale integration. Future trajectories emphasize deep interdisciplinary convergence, brain-like adaptive learning, biodegradable materials, and standardized industrial implementation. Memristors are poised to revolutionize intelligent medicine by delivering efficient, precise, and ultralow-power medical solutions.

Abstract: Cells from various tissue types exhibit a significant interplay between altered metabolism and oncogenic mutations. Lipid metabolism is highly sensitive to the microenvironment and undergoes substantial changes in cancer cells. This study examined lung tissues from six cancer patients to identify differences in the structural properties of lipids extracted from cancerous cells and adjacent healthy cells. FTIR band positions of symmetric and asymmetric stretching of CH₂ groups are sensitive to the trans-gauche conformer compositions. In contrast to healthy cells, cancer cells exhibit a non-cooperative structural transition at relatively lower temperatures. The transitions in acyl chain packing were monitored from the CH₂ scissoring bands. In contrast to cancer cells, the splitting of the CH₂ scissoring band (1465 cm⁻¹ into 1462 cm⁻¹ and 1472 cm⁻¹), observed in the lipids from healthy cells, indicates relatively dense orthorhombic chain packing. The free energies for trans-gauche structural transitions vary considerably between cancer cells and neighboring healthy cells. However, lipids from some cells with healthy-like morphology (identified as healthy cells) exhibit structural transitions similar to those of cancer cells. In contrast, none of the cancer cells exhibit healthy-like structural transitions of the lipids. Our findings suggest metabolic alterations may precede detectable morphological changes, potentially serving as early events that drive malignant transformation. Diagnostics based solely on morphology may not be sufficient for some patients. This situation necessitates metabolic profiling at the cellular level in addition to morphological analysis in cancer diagnostics. The data imply that environmental factors driving metabolic alterations significantly influence cancer initiation and development.

Abstract: Objective
To report a clinical series of four patients diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) who exhibit heterozygous pathogenic variants in the VPS13C gene.
Background
VPS13C encodes vacuolar protein sorting 13C, a lipid transport protein that localizes between the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes-lysosomes, functioning as a bridge to allow phospholipids to traverse the cytosol. Mutations in this gene have been associated with early-onset PARK23 and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), highlighting its importance in mitochondrial and lysosomal homeostasis.
Methods
Cases were identified through the Mayo Clinic Data Explorer. We included all subjects with a clinical diagnosis of PD who tested positive for a heterozygous VPS13C variant defined as pathogenic by the ACMG guidelines.
Results
DaT-SCAN imaging was consistent with PD diagnosis in three patients. Non-motor symptoms and cognitive impairment were prominent phenotypical characteristics in all cases: all the patients presented with insomnia, anxiety, depression, severe fatigue, and short-memory loss. The response to oral levodopa treatment was suboptimal, with an initial benefit followed by rapid decreased responsiveness. Additionally, two patients developed wearing-off episodes and one of them also exhibited treatment-induced dyskinesias.
Conclusion
We hypothesize that VPS13C may confer an increased risk of EOPD in carriers of pathogenic variants, and may function as a phenotype modifier gene, contributing to significant non-motor symptoms development and suboptimal levodopa response. Specifically, we propose that the suboptimal treatment response is associated with a decrease level of dopamine L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1).

Abstract: Introduction
Cognitive decline with aging is a population health issue. Cycling may help maintain, cognitive function and prevent cognitive decline in older adulthood. We conducted a scoping review to summarize and identify gaps in the literature examining cycling for transportation and/or recreation and their association with cognition in middle-aged and older adults.
Methods
Nine bibliographic databases were searched (inception-March 2024) to identify all articles that reported on cycling for transportation, leisure outdoors, or cycling indoors, along a virtual bike path, and any cognitive outcomes among adults ≥ 45 years of age.We summarized article findings and associations narratively.
Results
Searching identified 5171 citations, and 23 articles were included examining apparently healthy and clinical populations. Cycling interventions included virtual cycling indoors (randomized controlled trials=10, quasi-experimental=5), cycling outdoors for recreation (quasi-experimental=3, cross-sectional=1), any reason (cohort=1, crosssectional=1), or transportation (simulation modelling=2). The most frequently examined cognitive outcome was executive function (n=15), followed by memory (n=9) and, global cognition (n=9). Most articles (70%) reported a statistically significant positive association between cycling and a cognitive outcome. Identified literature gaps include, a lack of sex- and gender-based analyses; robust study designs exploring cycling

Abstract: Objective
Synchronized left-right stepping (bilateral coordination) is essential for safe movement and independent mobility function. The phase coordination index (PCI) quantifies this coordination. This study aimed to assess the reliability of PCI when measured multiple times within a study.
Methods
Forty-three neurotypical older adults completed a single 2-minute walk test, three weeks apart, to assess the reliability and consistency of the PCI. During the 2-minute walk test, participants walked along a 15-meter hallway at their preferred natural speed while wearing seven inertial monitoring units. PCI was first calculated for each trial using the standard method and then normalized to gait speed using two approaches. The normalization methods included dividing each PCI value by: (1) the mean gait speed of the individual trial, and (2) the mean gait speed averaged across both trials.
Results
The reliability (ICC) values were 0.566 for PCI alone, 0.771 when adjusted for gait speed at each trial, and 0.784 when adjusted for gait speed over both trials. Bland-Altman analysis showed no significant bias between trials across analyses.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that PCI offers acceptable test-retest reliability. However, the results of this investigation advocate for normalizing PCI to gait speed for enhanced reliability.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of urbanization has led to widespread exposure of wild birds to intensive light at night (LAN). While previous studies have established LAN-induced cognitive impairment in birds, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that LAN exposure impaired cognitive function of birds potentially through neurodegeneration, metabolic dysregulation and neuroinflammatory responses in the telencephalon. Using Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) as an avian model, under 16L:8D photoperiods, we compared associative learning and memory abilities and neurobiological parameters between experimental groups exposed to dim light at night (LAN) versus nocturnal darkness (CTR). Compared to the CTR birds, the LAN-exposed birds exhibited significantly lower learning and memory performances, reduced neuron density and simplified dendritic morphology in the telencephalons. The key energy metabolic substrates (cholic acid, CTP, D-mannose-6-phosphate) and neuroprotective agents (trehalose, menaquinone, L-gulono-1,4-lactone) in the telencephalons of LAN-exposed birds showed depletion, while oxidative stress markers (methionine sulfoxide) and inflammatory mediators (cis-gondoic acid) exhibited elevation. The neurotransmitter dopamine and histamine metabolic pathway were disrupted in the LAN-exposed birds. The microglias were activated with pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-6 levels increasing and anti-inflammatory IL-10 decreasing in the telencephalons of the LAN-exposed birds. These findings indicate a potential mechanistic pathway whereby dim light exposure at night can induce neuroinflammation through oxidative stress-mediated microglial activation, energy metabolism and neurotransmitter homeostasis disruption, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration in the telencephalons of birds.
