Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), resulting in motor dysfunction. Among the pathways examined, mitochondria and α-synuclein were found to play a major role in the disease progression. Hence, several attempts are being made to restore mitochondrial bioenergetics or protein aggregation pathways as disease-modifying strategies. Our earlier studies reported the protective effect of 2,4-dihydroxy-azaflavanone (azaflavanone) in a transgenic Drosophila fly model of PD. In the present study, we found that azaflavanone acts as an allosteric activator of SIRT1 in both cell-free and cell-based systems and the effects were more pronounced as compared to resveratrol. Also, azaflavanone appears to interact selectively with SIRT1 as other SIRTs such as SIRT3 and SIRT6 did not exhibit any gross changes in cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Molecular docking studies depicted a higher docking score with azaflavanone than with resveratrol. Further, N27 cells treated with azaflavanone exhibited a dose-dependent increase in the mitotracker staining, mtDNA/nuclear DNA ratio, and also mitochondrial bioenergetics. The observed effects appear to be due to the activation of SIRT1, as evidenced by an increase in the expression of PGC-1α and TFAM, which are the downstream targets of SIRT1. Lastly, the Parkinsonian mimic MPP+-induced disturbance in the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and biogenesis were ameliorated by azaflavanone. Overall, our findings indicate that azaflavanone, being an antioxidant and an allosteric activator of SIRT1, is a promising compound for ameliorating the pathophysiology of PD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease among adults worldwide. It is characterised by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and, in some cases, presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions of α-synuclein, called Lewy bodies, a pathognomonic sign of the disease. Clinical diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of motor alterations. The treatments currently available have no neuroprotective effect. The exact causes of PD are poorly understood. Therefore, more precise preclinical models have been developed in recent years that use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). In vitro studies can provide new information on PD pathogenesis and may help to identify new therapeutic targets or to develop new drugs.
Resumen
La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es la segunda enfermedad neurodegenerativa más común a nivel mundial en adultos mayores. Se caracteriza por la pérdida de neuronas dopaminérgicas (nDAs) en la sustancia nigra pars compacta del mesencéfalo y en algunos casos acompañada de la aparición de cuerpos intracitoplásmaticos de Lewy de α-sinucleína, signo patognomónico de la enfermedad. La EP se diagnostica clínicamente por la presencia de alteraciones motoras principalmente y en la actualidad los tratamientos presentan nula actividad neuroprotectora. Aún no se han establecido las causas exactas de la EP, por lo que, en los últimos años se ha buscado el desarrollo de modelos preclínicos más precisos, utilizando células troncales pluripotentes inducidas (iPSCs). Permitiendo el estudio de la enfermedad de manera in vitro para generar conocimiento novedoso sobre su patogénesis y el descubrimiento de nuevos posibles blancos terapéuticos o el desarrollo de nuevos fármacos.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurological disease associated with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Oxidative stress is a key player in instigating apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons. To improve the survival of neurons many dietary phytochemicals have gathered significant attention recently. Thus, the present study implements a comprehensive network pharmacology approach to unravel the mechanisms of action of dietary phytochemicals that benefit disease management. A literature search was performed to identify ligands (i.e., comprising dietary phytochemicals and Food and Drug Administration pre-approved PD drugs) in the PubMed database. Targets associated with selected ligands were extracted from the search tool for interactions of chemicals (STITCH) database. Then, the construction of a gene-gene interaction (GGI) network, analysis of hub-gene, functional and pathway enrichment, associated transcription factors, miRNAs, ligand-target interaction network, docking were performed using various bioinformatics tools together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The database search resulted in 69 ligands and 144 unique targets. GGI and subsequent topological measures indicate histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300), mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)2, and CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) as hub genes. Neurodegeneration, MAPK signaling, apoptosis, and zinc binding are key pathways and gene ontology terms. hsa-miR-5692a and SCNA gene-associated transcription factors interact with all the 3 hub genes. Ligand-target interaction (LTI) network analysis suggest rasagiline and baicalein as candidate ligands targeting MAPK1. Rasagiline and baicalein form stable complexes with the Y205, K330, and V173 residues of MAPK1. Computational molecular insights suggest that baicalein and rasagiline are promising preclinical candidates for PD management.

Abstract: Background
Growing evidence supports the potential role of sleep in the motor progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia (RWA) are important sleep parameters. The association between SWS and RWA with PD motor progression and their predictive value have not yet been elucidated.
Methods
We retro-prospectively analyzed clinical and polysomnographic data of 136 patients with PD. The motor symptoms were assessed using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III (UPDRS III) at baseline and follow-up to determine its progression. Partial correlation analysis was used to explore the cross-sectional associations between slow-wave energy (SWE), RWA and clinical symptoms. Longitudinal analyses were performed using Cox regression and linear mixed-effects models.
Results
Among 136 PD participants, cross-sectional partial correlation analysis showed SWE decreased with the prolongation of the disease course (P = 0.046), RWA density was positively correlated with Hoehn & Yahr (H-Y) stage (tonic RWA, P < 0.001; phasic RWA, P = 0.002). Cox regression analysis confirmed that low SWE (HR = 1.739, 95% CI = 1.038–2.914; P = 0.036; FDR-P = 0.036) and high tonic RWA (HR = 0.575, 95% CI = 0.343–0.963; P = 0.032; FDR-P = 0.036) were predictors of motor symptom progression. Furthermore, we found that lower SWE predicted faster rate of axial motor progression (P < 0.001; FDR-P < 0.001) while higher tonic RWA density was associated with faster rate of rigidity progression (P = 0.006; FDR-P = 0.024) using linear mixed-effects models.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that SWS and RWA might represent markers of different motor subtypes progression in PD.

Abstract: As the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are complex and influenced by many factors, it is challenging to quantify gait abnormalities adequately using a single type of signal. Therefore, a wearable multisource gait monitoring system is developed to perform a quantitative analysis of gait abnormalities for improving the effectiveness of the clinical diagnosis. To detect multisource gait data for an accurate evaluation of gait abnormalities, force sensitive sensors, piezoelectric sensors, and inertial measurement units are integrated into the devised device. The modulation circuits and wireless framework are designed to simultaneously collect plantar pressure, dynamic deformation, and postural angle of the foot and then wirelessly transmit these collected data. With the designed system, multisource gait data from PD patients and healthy controls are collected. Multisource features for quantifying gait abnormalities are extracted and evaluated by a significance test of difference and correlation analysis. The results show that the features extracted from every single type of data are able to quantify the health status of the subjects (p < 0.001, ρ > 0.50). More importantly, the validity of multisource gait data is verified. The results demonstrate that the gait feature fusing multisource data achieves a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.831, a maximum Area Under Curve of 0.9206, and a maximum feature-based classification accuracy of 88.3%. The system proposed in this study can be applied to the gait analysis and objective evaluation of PD.

Abstract: Cardinal motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) include bradykinesia, rest tremor and/or rigidity. This symptomatology can additionally encompass abnormal gait, balance and postural patterns at advanced stages of the disease. Besides pharmacological and surgical therapies, physical exercise represents an important strategy for the management of these advanced impairments. Traditionally, diagnosis and classification of such abnormalities have relied on partially subjective evaluations performed by neurologists during short and temporally scattered hospital appointments. Emerging sports medical methods, including wearable sensor-based movement assessment and computational-statistical analysis, are paving the way for more objective and systematic diagnoses in everyday life conditions. These approaches hold promise to facilitate customizing clinical trials to specific PD groups, as well as personalizing neuromodulation therapies and exercise prescriptions for each individual, remotely and regularly, according to disease progression or specific motor symptoms. We aim to summarize exercise benefits for PD with a specific emphasis on gait and balance deficits, and to provide an overview of recent advances in movement analysis approaches, notably from the sports science community, with value for diagnosis and prognosis. Although such techniques are becoming increasingly available, their standardization and optimization for clinical purposes is critically missing, especially in their translation to complex neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. We highlight the importance of integrating state-of-the-art gait and movement analysis approaches, in combination with other motor, electrophysiological or neural biomarkers, to improve the understanding of the diversity of PD phenotypes, their response to therapies and the dynamics of their disease progression.

Abstract: α-Synuclein, a protein mostly present in presynaptic terminals, accumulates neuropathologically in Parkinson’s disease in a 6-stage sequence and propagates in the nervous system in a prion-like manner through neurons and glia. In stage 3, the substantia nigra are affected, provoking motor symptoms and the amygdaloid complex, leading to different nonmotor symptoms; from here, synucleinopathy spreads to the temporal cortex and beyond. The expected increase in Parkinson's disease incidence accelerates the need for detection biomarkers; however, the heterogeneity of this disease, including pathological aggregates and pathophysiological pathways, poses a challenge in the search for new therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Proteomic analyses are lacking, and the literature regarding synucleinopathy, neural and glial involvement, and volume of the human amygdaloid complex is controversial. Therefore, the present study combines both proteomic and stereological probes. Data-independent acquisition-parallel accumulation of serial fragmentation proteomic analysis revealed a remarkable proteomic impact, especially at the synaptic level in the human amygdaloid complex in Parkinson’s disease. Among the 199 differentially expressed proteins, guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha-1 (GNAI1), elongation factor 1-alpha 1 (EEF1A1), myelin proteolipid protein (PLP1), neuroplastin (NPTN), 14-3-3 protein eta (YWHAH), gene associated with retinoic and interferon-induced mortality 19 protein (GRIM19), and orosomucoid-2 (ORM2) stand out as potential biomarkers in Parkinson’s disease. Stereological analysis, however, did not reveal alterations regarding synucleinopathy, neural or glial populations, or volume changes. To our knowledge, this is the first proteomic study of the human amygdaloid complex in Parkinson’s disease, and it identified possible biomarkers of the disease. Lewy pathology could not be sufficient to cause neurodegeneration or alteration of microglial and astroglial populations in the human amygdaloid complex in Parkinson’s disease. Nevertheless, damage at the proteomic level is manifest, showing up significant synaptic involvement.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease (PD) poses emotional and financial challenges to patients, families, caregivers, and health care systems. Self-management systems show promise in empowering people with PD and enabling more control over their treatment. The collaborative nature of PD care requires communication between patients and health care professionals. While past reviews explored self-management systems in PD diagnosis and symptom management with a focus on patient portals, there is limited research addressing the interconnectivity of systems catering to the needs of both patients and clinicians. A system’s acceptability and usability for clinicians are pivotal for enabling comprehensive data collection and supporting clinical decision-making, which can enhance patient care and treatment outcomes.
Objective
This review study aims to assess PD self-management systems that include a clinician portal and to determine which features enhance acceptability and usability for clinicians. The primary aim is to assess evidence of clinicians’ acceptability and usability of self-management systems with a focus on the integration of systems into clinical workflows, data collection points, monitoring, clinical decision-making support, and extended education and training.
Methods
The review will entail 3 separate stages: a literature review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, a product search, and an evaluation of the level of evidence for the identified products. For the first stage, 5 databases will be searched: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, ACM digital library, and IEEE Xplore. Studies eligible for inclusion will be qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies examining patients’ and clinician’s perceptions of the acceptability and usability of digital health interventions, synthesized by a narrative qualitative analysis. A web search in the iOS Apple App Store and Android Google Play Store will identify currently available tools; the level of evidence for these will then be assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines.
Results
Literature search and screening began soon after submission of the protocol, and the review is expected to be completed by end of September 2024.
Conclusions
This review will examine currently available self-management systems in PD care, focusing on their acceptability and usability. This is significant because there is limited research addressing the integration of clinicians into these systems. The findings from this study may provide critical knowledge and insight to help inform future research and will contribute to the design of self-management systems that promote collaborative efforts in PD care.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) are controlled by a sophisticated network known as the heart-brain axis. This chapter delves deep into the pathophysiology of PD, exploring in detail the links between the brain and the heart, covering topics as diverse as autonomic dysfunction, cardiac sympathetic denervation and neuroinflammation. We investigate the potential for genetics, proteomics, and biomarkers to radically alter the course of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disease diagnosis and treatment. Protective medications, deep brain stimulation, and behavioural modifications are some of the newer and more established methods that have emerged in recent years to maintain the health of the heart and brain, two of the body’s most important systems.Ultimately, this chapter argues that to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD) effectively, it is essential to opt for a multidisciplinary approach that takes into account both the neurological and cardiovascular aspects of the condition.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood etiology. An accurate diagnosis of idiopathic PD remains challenging as misdiagnosis is common in routine clinical practice. Moreover, current therapeutics focus on symptomatic management rather than curing or slowing down disease progression. Therefore, identification of potential PD biomarkers and providing a better understanding of the underlying disease pathophysiology are urgent. Herein, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS) based metabolomics approaches were used to profile the serum metabolome of 50 patients with different stages of idiopathic PD (early, mid and advanced) and 45 age-matched controls. Levels of 57 metabolites including cysteine-S-sulfate and N-acetyl tryptophan were significantly higher in patients with PD compared to controls, with lower amounts of additional 51 metabolites including vanillic acid, and N-acetylaspartic acid. Xanthines, including caffeine and its downstream metabolites, were lowered in patients with PD relative to controls indicating a potential role caffeine and its metabolites against neuronal damage. Seven metabolites, namely cysteine-S-sulfate, 1-methylxanthine, vanillic acid, N-acetylaspartic acid, 3-N-acetyl tryptophan, 5-methoxytryptophol, and 13-HODE yielded a ROC curve with a high classification accuracy (AUC 0.977). Comparison between different PD stages showed that cysteine-S-sulfate levels were significantly increasing with the advancement of PD stages while LPI 20:4 was significantly decreasing with disease progression. Our findings provide new biomarker candidates to assist in the diagnosis of PD and monitor its progression. Unusual metabolites like cysteine-S-sulfate might point to therapeutic targets that could enhance the development of novel PD treatments, such as NMDA antagonists.

Abstract: The research provides a unique technique for freezing of gait recognition by utilizing a precisely built windowing algorithm on the Daphnet dataset. The technique divides continuous motion data from sensors into separate windows, allowing for a detailed study of gait patterns. The selected windowing method guarantees that temporal dependencies are adequately captured, boosting the model's capacity to distinguish major changes in movement patterns. The basis of this technology is the use of a layered long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. This approach is prompted by LSTM's potential to preserve long-term dependencies, which is an important feature in comprehending the temporal characteristics of hyper parameters. The stacked LSTM model provides an effective way for collecting variations in time-series data and making reliable predictions of Parkinson's disease. Through incremental modification of hyperparameters, this approach achieves exceptional performance, claiming a 94.44% specificity and 93.32% sensitivity. These positive findings represent a significant improvement in the freezing of gait detection technology, with potential use in mobility rehabilitation employing exoskeleton robots for those with PD. The study adds to the larger area of wearable medical devices by offering an innovative and reliable technique of gait pattern detection. The integration of the windowing algorithm and a stacked LSTM demonstrates the possibility for reliable freezing of gait identification, thereby improving the standard of life of people suffering from PD. Additionally, the F1 score reached at about 4s, with an average of 0.92. This conclusion highlights the relevance of window size in influencing the model's expected performance, because bigger windows enable the obtaining of more detailed data.

Abstract: The underlying mechanisms of inflammasome activation and the following dopaminergic neuron loss caused by chronic neuroinflammation remain entirely unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of crocin on the inflammasome complex within an experimental model of Parkinson's disease (PD) using male Wistar rats. PD was induced by the stereotaxic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and crocin was intraperitoneally administrated one week before the lesion, and then treatment continued for 21 days. Open field (OF) and elevated plus maze tests were applied for behavioral assays. Furthermore, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunostaining were performed on whole brain tissue, while dissected substantia nigra (SN) was used for immunoblotting and real-time PCR to evaluate compartments involved in PD. The time spent in the center of test was diminished in the LPS group, while treatment with 30 mg/kg of crocin significantly increased it. H&E staining showed a significant increase in cell infiltration at the site of LPS injection, which was ameliorated upon crocin treatment. Notably, crocin-treated animals showed a reduced number of caspase-1 and IL-1β positive cells, whereas the number of positive cells was increased in the LPS group (P < 0.05). A significant decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression was also found in the LPS group, while crocin treatment significantly elevated its expression. IL-1β, IL-18, NLRP1, and AIM2 genes expression significantly increased in the LPS group. On the other hand, treatment with 30 mg/kg of crocin significantly downregulated the expression levels of these genes along with NLRP1 (P < 0.05). In summary, our findings suggest that crocin reduces neuroinflammation in PD by diminishing IL-1β and caspase-1 levels, potentially by inhibiting the expression of AIM2 and NLRP1 genes.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease (PD) is a worldwide, fast-growing, progressive neurodegenerative condition. Its multifaceted clinical presentation includes a wide range of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Smartphones present a potential solution to better monitor and subsequently alleviate PD symptoms.
Objective
The aim of this study is to explore neurologists’ and patients’ needs and preferences regarding the design and functionality of a new smartphone app for PD, DigiPark.
Methods
This qualitative, noninterventional study gathered data through two primary methods: (1) by conducting interviews with 9 neurologists and (2) through a usability test including 5 patients with PD.
Results
The neurologists affirmed the necessity for a patient-centered app, highlighting the complexities of PD management. They advocated for personalized app functionalities to improve patients’ quality of life and emphasized the need for enhanced patient-provider communication. Feedback from the usability test indicated a preference for a clear, simple user interface, as well as elucidation of the app’s benefits. Concerns about the app’s time demands and the complexity of certain features like medication management were expressed. Furthermore, patients with PD consistently showed interest in features that could track and monitor their progress over time. This highlights the need to include clear benefits within the app to maintain user engagement and commitment.
Conclusions

Abstract: Background
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to significant global morbidity and mortality, with potential neurological consequences, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.
Methods
To address this critical question, we conducted an in-depth transcriptome analysis of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in both COVID-19 and PD patients. We identified common pathways and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), performed enrichment analysis, constructed protein‒protein interaction networks and gene regulatory networks, and employed machine learning methods to develop disease diagnosis and progression prediction models. To further substantiate our findings, we performed validation of hub genes using a single-cell sequencing dataset encompassing DA neurons from PD patients, as well as transcriptome sequencing of DA neurons from a mouse model of MPTP(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced PD. Furthermore, a drug-protein interaction network was also created.
Results
We gained detailed insights into biological functions and signaling pathways, including ion transport and synaptic signaling pathways. CD38 was identified as a potential key biomarker. Disease diagnosis and progression prediction models were specifically tailored for PD. Molecular docking simulations and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to predict potential therapeutic drugs, revealing that genistein holds significant promise for exerting dual therapeutic effects on both PD and COVID-19.
Conclusions
Our study provides innovative strategies for advancing PD-related research and treatment in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by elucidating the common pathogenesis between COVID-19 and PD in DA neurons.

Abstract: Background
While Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology is not clear yet, accumulated alpha-synuclein is proposed to induce neurodegeneration. Selenium (Se) and its functional proteins play a key role in aggregation of misfolded proteins. However, their implications in neurodegenerative process are unclear.
Aim
Diagnosing Se and selenoprotein P (SelP), selenoprotein S (SelS) proportions in serum of PD patients to compare with healthy controls, whether the changes in their concentration could be a biomarker for PD.
Methods
Se concentration was investigated in 30 PD patients and 30 controls using atomic absorption spectrometry. Also, alpha-Synuclein, SelP, and SelS levels were evaluated by ELISA. The parameters were compared in PD patients and controls. Also, the variations within the case group according to their age, disorder stage, and drug administration were evaluated.
Results
PD subjects had higher Se concentration. The mean SelP in PD patients was lower from controls, whilst SelS levels were higher. Also, the concentration of alpha-synuclein was higher in PD patients. However, age, stage (except UPDRS III), and disorder duration had no influence on the Se and selenoproteins level, whilst there was a direct association between alpha-synuclein levels and disorder stage. Also, alpha-synuclein proportions in subjects using levodopa was significantly higher.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that serum levels of Se and SelP could be a biomarker or risk factor for PD. Although SelS interferes to reduce aggregated proteins, its pathway in PD is not clearly understood. Future studies could focus on how SelS can reduce on alpha-synuclein aggregation. Thus, other studies should be performed on this issue to induce the selenoproteins in PD.

Abstract: Objective
To identify multi-sectoral integrated care initiatives for people with Parkinson’s disease and caregivers.
Method
Following the Matrix Method we created a synthesis of literature across methodological approaches. The search was conducted in four databases until June 2022, and included studies focusing on multi-sectoral integrated care initiatives, and how they helped people with Parkinson’s disease and caregivers in everyday living.
Results
The search yielded 5921 articles of which nine were included. We identified four topics describing characteristics of multi-sectoral integrated care initiatives: 1) Peer-support, 2) Personalised care plan, 3) One-off initiatives limited in time and 4) Presence of a coordinator. And four topics describing how the initiatives helped in everyday living: 1) Confidence, trust and support, 2) Positive changes in health outcomes, 3) Quality of life, coping skills & psychosocial adjustment, and 4) A strengthened multi-agent collaboration and personalised assistance.
Conclusion
Multi-sectoral integrated care initiatives should be ongoing offers, and include a Parkinson care-coordinator, who can enhance multi-sectoral communication and an individualised approach to information about resources responsive to evolving needs at different disease stages.
Practice implications
Initiatives should be multidisciplinary, multi-sectoral and aimed at people with Parkinson’s disease and caregivers, preferably facilitated by a care-coordinator to promote cross-sectoral communication.

Abstract: Adenosine A2A-receptors (A2AR) and dopamine D2-receptors (D2R) are known to work together in a synergistic manner. Inhibiting A2ARs by genetic or pharmacological means can relief symptoms and have neuroprotective effects in certain conditions. We applied PET imaging to evaluate the impact of the A2AR antagonist KW6002 on D2R availability and neuroinflammation in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. Male Wistar rats with 6-hydroxydopamine-induced damage to the right striatum were given 3 mg/kg of KW6002 daily for 20 days. Motor function was assessed using the rotarod and cylinder tests, and neuroinflammation and dopamine receptor availability were measured using PET scans with the tracers [11C]PBR28 and [11C]raclopride, respectively. On day 7 and 22 following 6-OHDA injection, rats were sacrificed for postmortem analysis. PET scans revealed a peak in neuroinflammation on day 7. Chronic treatment with KW6002 significantly reduced [11C]PBR28 uptake in the ipsilateral striatum [normalized to contralateral striatum] and [11C]raclopride binding in both striata when compared to the vehicle group. These imaging findings were accompanied by an improvement in motor function. Postmortem analysis showed an 84% decrease in the number of Iba-1+ cells in the ipsilateral striatum [normalized to contralateral striatum] of KW6002-treated rats compared to vehicle rats on day 22 (p = 0.007), corroborating the PET findings. Analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase levels showed less dopaminergic neuron loss in the ipsilateral striatum of KW6002-treated rats compared to controls on day 7. These findings suggest that KW6002 reduces inflammation and dopaminergic neuron loss, leading to less motor symptoms in this animal model of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron death in the substantia nigra, leading to motor dysfunction. Autophagy dysregulation has been implicated in PD pathogenesis. This study explores the role of miR-214–3p in PD, focusing on its impact on autophagy and dopaminergic neuron viability. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that miR-214–3p inhibits autophagy and promotes dopaminergic neuron apoptosis. Behavioral assessments and molecular analyses reveal exacerbation of PD symptoms upon miR-214–3p overexpression. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations identify ATG3 as a target, shedding light on miR-214–3p's regulatory role in autophagy. These findings enhance our understanding of PD pathogenesis and propose miR-214–3p as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for modulating autophagy and neuronal survival in PD.

Abstract: Mitochondrial dysfunction is pivotal in the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Interventions to increase mitochondrial biogenesis and maintain the balance in mitochondrial turnover have the potential to protect against neurological damage. In addition to their crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondria impact diverse activities, including cellular metabolism, cellular quality control, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, it has become imperative to better understand the regulation and function of mitochondria in PD. With this review, we aim to stimulate research that explores mitochondria-oriented neuroprotection strategies to maintain the balance in mitochondrial turnover. First, we summarize research on newly discovered genes that regulate PD mitochondrial autophagy through PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), namely AMBRA1, SYNJ2BP, and SIAH3. Second, we review PD-related mitochondrial proteins, including STRT3 and SIRT6, and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, covering their mechanisms of involvement in PD. Third, we emphasize the roles of the mitochondrial complex, pyroptosis, and copper-induced cell death in mitochondrial damage in PD. Finally, we present a brief overview of new therapeutic strategies to correct mitochondrial defects that may be applicable for targeting mitochondria in PD patients.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder triggered by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Recent studies have demonstrated that necroptosis is involved in dopaminergic neuronal cell death and the resulting neuroinflammation. During the process of necroptosis, a necrosome complex is formed consisting of the proteins receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Although the neuroprotective effects of the RIPK1-specific inhibitor necrostatin-1, as well as RIPK3 and MLKL knockout in mice, have been described, the effects of RIPK3 pharmacological inhibitors have not yet been reported in animal models of PD. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of GSK872, a specific RIPK3 inhibitor, in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. GSK872 rescued MPTP-induced motor impairment and inhibited tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic cell death in the SN and striatum. Additionally, GSK872 inhibited the MPTP-induced increase in the expression of p-RIPK3 and p-MLKL in both the dopaminergic neurons and microglia, as assessed by biochemical and histological analyses. GSK872 further inhibited microglial activation and the expression of inflammatory mediators including NLRP3, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the SN region of MPTP mice. Using in vitro experiments, we validated the effects of GSK872 on necroptosis in SH-SY5Y neuronal and BV2 microglial cells. Overall, our results suggest that GSK872 exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, and may thus have therapeutic potential for PD.

Abstract: Several mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unclear, and effective treatments are still lacking. The conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), known as SUMOylation, to key proteins in PD has shown potential beneficial effects. Considering that this process is reversed by SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs), this study addressed the effects of increased SUMO-2/3 conjugation, mediated by SENP3 knockdown, in the intranasal 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD. Two weeks after infusion of the shRNA-containing lentiviral vector into the dorsolateral striatum and one week following intranasal MPTP administration, male Wistar rats were evaluated using cognitive and motor behavioural tests. Infection efficiency was confirmed by detecting GFP expression in the dorsolateral striatum. SENP3 knockdown, verified by Western blotting, resulted in increased SUMO-2/3 conjugation. MPTP-administered rats displayed impairments in both recognition and spatial memories, while SENP3 knockdown prevented these deficits. Rats exposed to MPTP also exhibited motor dysfunction, which was ameliorated by SENP3 knockdown. These findings underscore the involvement of SUMO-2/3 conjugation in PD and its potential as a novel therapeutic target to counteract cognitive and motor impairments induced by neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Alpha-(1,6)-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) has been found to play a role in modulating the central immune system and inflammatory responses. Limited studies have assessed the correlations between serum FUT8 levels and various non-motor symptoms associated with early Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, our research aims to investigate the associations between serum FUT8 levels and symptoms such as smell dysfunction, sleep duration, sleep problems, and MMSE scores in PD patients. FUT8 and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We analyzed the correlations between serum FUT8 levels, NfL, and early symptoms of PD using Spearman's correlation, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression models. The expression of FUT8 in CSF samples from PD patients was significantly upregulated, with its protein levels in CSF being positively associated with serum levels. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between serum FUT8 levels with NfL levels, smell dysfunction, short sleep duration, and long sleep duration. However, a significant inverse relationship was observed between FUT8 levels and MMSE scores. Additionally, we explored gender and age differences in the correlations of FUT8 levels and early symptoms in patients. This study reveals that increased FUT8 levels are positively correlated with a higher risk of early PD-associated symptoms. These findings suggest that serum FUT8 could serve as a promising biomarker for the early detection of PD.

Abstract: Objective
Researchers are investigating the potential of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) obtained from exhaled breath and sebum as non-invasive tools for early Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis. The present study aims to assess the feasibility of using VOC analysis for PD diagnosis and determine the overall diagnostic accuracy of the proposed tests.
Methods
We performed systematic searches based on the PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant studies on VOCs in PD diagnosis using exhaled breath or sebum samples. The selected articles were described, and meta-analysis was conducted on those that provided the sensitivity and specificity data.
Results
Out of 1268 articles initially identified, 8 met the inclusion criteria and provided specific sensitivity and specificity data for PD, which were included in the current meta-analysis. The pooled analysis of these findings showed a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85, a sensitivity of 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72, 0.88), and a specificity of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.84).
Conclusion
The analysis of VOCs in exhaled breath and sebum has shown promise as a new avenue for non-invasive diagnosis of PD. VOCs' ability to distinguish PD from healthy controls suggests their potential clinical application in screening for the disease. Consequently, VOCs hold significant potential as biomarkers for PD diagnosis and offer a promising novel approach to identifying and diagnosing the condition.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is a neurological condition that worsens over time and impairs movement. It happens when the brain’s dopamine-producing cells start to deteriorate and die, which causes a lack of dopamine. Parkinson’s disease signs and symptoms include tremors, stiffness, and issues with balance and coordination. Parkinson’s disease currently has no known cure, but there are treatment options like medication and therapy that can help manage the symptoms. Several studies, including those utilizing biomarkers and machine learning algorithms, have looked into the prediction of Parkinson’s disease. According to these studies, it is possible to predict the onset of Parkinson’s disease using a variety of information, including genetic data, brain imaging, and motor symptoms. This research still has some shortcomings. The lack of extensive and varied datasets for training and validating prediction models is a significant limitation. The difficulty in separating Parkinson’s disease from other movement disorders that might exhibit similar symptoms is another drawback. This chapter explains the fundamentals of Parkinson’s disease, including its history, the main factors that contribute to its development, available datasets for Parkinson’s prediction, and its risk factors. The chapter also discusses the experimental analysis of data obtained from both healthy individuals and Parkinson’s patients to predict using the MATLAB® Tool. The findings demonstrate that machine learning algorithms produce more accurate results than conventional algorithms when used to label and predict disease using the provided input.

Abstract: Summary
While machine learning (ML) research has recently grown more in popularity, its application in the omics domain is constrained by access to sufficiently large, high-quality datasets needed to train ML models. Federated learning (FL) represents an opportunity to enable collaborative curation of such datasets among participating institutions. We compare the simulated performance of several models trained using FL against classically trained ML models on the task of multi-omics Parkinson’s disease prediction. We find that FL model performance tracks centrally trained ML models, where the most performant FL model achieves an AUC-PR of 0.876 ± 0.009, 0.014 ± 0.003 less than its centrally trained variation. We also determine that the dispersion of samples within a federation plays a meaningful role in model performance. Our study implements several open-source FL frameworks and aims to highlight some of the challenges and opportunities when applying these collaborative methods in multi-omics studies.

Abstract: SUMOylation is a post-translational modification essential for various biological processes. SUMO proteins bind to target substrates in a three-step enzymatic pathway, which is rapidly reversible by the action of specific proteases, known as SENPs. Studies have shown that SUMOylation is dysregulated in several human disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction, deficits in autophagy, and oxidative stress. Considering the potential neuroprotective roles of SUMOylation, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of SENP3 knockdown in H4 neuroglioma cells exposed to rotenone, an in vitro model of cytotoxicity that mimics dopaminergic loss in Parkinson's disease (PD). The current data show that SENP3 knockdown increases SUMO-2/3 conjugates, which is accompanied by reduced levels of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 and increased levels of the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1. Of high interest, SENP3 knockdown prevented rotenone-induced superoxide production and cellular death. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of SUMOylation in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and the neuroprotective potential of this modification in PD.

Abstract: Background
Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) for Parkinson's disease can be performed with intraoperative neurophysiological and radiographic guidance. Conventional T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences, however, often fail to provide definitive borders of the STN. Novel magnetic resonance imaging sequences, such as susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), might better localize the STN borders and facilitate radiographic targeting. We compared the radiographic location of the dorsal and ventral borders of the STN using SWI with intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER) during awake STN-DBS for Parkinson's disease.
Methods
Thirteen consecutive patients who underwent placement of 24 STN-DBS leads for Parkinson's disease were analyzed retrospectively. Preoperative targeting was performed with SWI, and MER data were obtained from intraoperative electrophysiology records. The boundaries of the STN on SWI were identified by a blinded investigator.
Results
The final electrode position differed significantly from the planned coordinates in depth but not in length or width, indicating that MER guided the final electrode depth. When we compared the boundaries of the STN by MER and SWI, SWI accurately predicted the entry into the STN but underestimated the length and ventral boundary of the STN by 1.2 mm. This extent of error approximates the span of a DBS contact and could affect the placement of directional contacts within the STN.
Conclusions
MER might continue to have a role in STN-DBS. This could potentially be mitigated by further refinement of imaging protocols to better image the ventral boundary of the STN.

Acupuncture plays a critical role for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by ferroptosis of dopaminergic neurons. It has been found that acupuncture can reduce iron accumulation. However, the mechanism of acupuncture therapy against PD by inhibiting ferroptosis remains unclear.
Objective
To investigate the potential mechanism of acupuncture on alleviating ferroptosis in 6-OHDA-induced PD rats.
Methods
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group, acupuncture group, and PD model group, with the PD model induced by 6-OHDA. The motor function of the rats was tested by the rotation test and suspension test, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and iron staining were performed to analyze nerve damage, and the effect of acupuncture on the accumulation of iron in the substantia nigra (SN). RNA-seq analysis in the SN of rats were performed to discover ferroptosis-related genes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) resulted from the acupuncture treatment were identified and were used for Gene Ontology (GO) function, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, and alternative splicing (AS) analysis of the transcriptome was performed. Western blot was used to detect the protein level change of Slc7a11/xCT.
Results
Rotation test and suspension test indicated a positive effect of acupuncture on body weight gain and limb function. Perl's iron staining and ELISA test detected 6-OHDA induced iron accumulation in the SN and nerve damage, which was mitigated by acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture treatment brought about the differential expression of a total of 1088 genes in the SN of rats. GO and KEGG enrichment revealed that such DEGs were mainly associated with several key biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF) terms. These terms included collagen fibril organization, extracellular matrix organization, collagen trimer, extracellular matrix components, chemokine receptor binding and cargo receptor activity, etc. Additionally, the DEGs were found to be involved in pathways such as complement and coagulation. The PPI network of DEGs suggested a critical role of Slc7a11, which was further supported by an up-regulated Slc7a11/xCT protein level in the substantia nigra (SN) tissue of rats treated with acupuncture compared to their PD model counterparts (P = 0.045).
Conclusion
Acupuncture may prevent ferroptosis through Slc7a11/xCT as one of the targets in 6-OHDA-induced PD model and thereby could be promising for PD treatment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, which may be largely due to the mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitophagy. Thus, it is of great importance to seek novel therapeutic strategies for PD targeting mitochondrial function and mitophagy. Cytarabine is a marine-derived antimetabolite used in the treatment of acute leukemia, which is also used in the study of the nervous system. In this study, we found that cytarabine pretreatment significantly inhibited the apoptosis and necrosis in the ROT-induced SH-SY5Y cell PD model and reduced the oxidative stress, as evidenced by the reduced MDA levels and the increased levels of SOD, GSH, and total antioxidant capacity. Cytarabine can also enhance mitochondrial vitality, improve mitochondrial respiratory function, and preserve mitochondrial morphology. Cytarabine also enhanced the expression of the mitophagy-related proteins PINK1, Parkin, VDAC1, and DJ-1, and its actions can be reversed by treatment with AMPK inhibitor - Compound C (CC), suggesting that AMPK activation may be involved in cytarabine-enhanced mitophagy. Furthermore, cytarabine can also ameliorate the motor symptoms in the MPTP-induced PD-like mice model, and attenuate the neuropathy in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD mice, while Compound C antagonized cytarabine's beneficial effects. In summary, marine-derived compound cytarabine could resist neurological damage both in vitro and in vivo by activating AMPK to increase PINK1/Parkin-induced mitophagy, serving as a promising disease modulator for treating neurodegenerative disease.

Abstract: Background
Gait impairment has a major impact on quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is believed that basal ganglia oscillatory activity at β frequencies (15–30 Hz) may contribute to gait impairment, but the precise dynamics of this oscillatory activity during gait remain unclear. Additionally, auditory cues are known to lead to improvements in gait kinematics in PD. If the neurophysiological mechanisms of this cueing effect were better understood they could be leveraged to treat gait impairments using adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) technologies.
Objective
We aimed to characterize the dynamics of subthalamic nucleus (STN) oscillatory activity during stepping movements in PD and to establish the neurophysiological mechanisms by which auditory cues modulate gait.
Methods
We studied STN local field potentials (LFPs) in eight PD patients while they performed stepping movements. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used to discover transient states of spectral activity that occurred during stepping with and without auditory cues.
Results
The occurrence of low and high β bursts was suppressed during and after auditory cues. This manifested as a decrease in their fractional occupancy and state lifetimes. Interestingly, α transients showed the opposite effect, with fractional occupancy and state lifetimes increasing during and after auditory cues.
Conclusions
We show that STN oscillatory activity in the α and β frequency bands are differentially modulated by gait-promoting oscillatory cues. These findings suggest that the enhancement of α rhythms may be an approach for ameliorating gait impairments in PD.

Abstract: Manganese (Mn2+) is among the indispensable trace elements required by the human body, but high-dose Mn2+ exposure can lead to Mn poisoning. Therefore, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for Mn2+ has been established for normal individuals in different countries. However, whether the UL of Mn2+ is suitable for the patients of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. Here, we found unexpectedly that the dietary UL of Mn2+ supplement enhanced mitophagy through the PINK1/Parkin-mediated ubiquitin-dependent pathway in MPTP- induced mice and cells. Mn2+ promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, thereby increased the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain with restored mitochondrial function. Additionally, Mn2+ directly elevated the activity of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which contributed to the clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), restored dopaminergic and motor functions in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model. Similar results were also observed in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas knockdown parkin using siRNA or application of mitophagy inhibitors (Mdivi-1 or Cyclosporine A), abolished the neuroprotective effects of Mn2+. These findings demonstrate that the dietary UL of Mn2+ is protective for the MPTP-induced Parkinson-like lesions with the mechanisms involving the activation of mitophagy, suggesting potential intervention of PD by moderately increasing dietary Mn2+ intake.

Abstract: Atrazine (ATZ) is one of the most used herbicides in the US and a known endocrine disruptor. ATZ is frequently detected in drinking water, especially in Midwestern regions of the United States, exceeding the EPA regulation of maximum contamination level (MCL) of 3 ppb. Epidemiology studies have suggested an association between ATZ exposure and neurodegeneration. Less, however, is known about the neurotoxic mechanism of ATZ, particularly for exposures at a developmental stage. Here, we exposed floor plate progenitors (FPPs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to low concentrations of ATZ at 0.3 and 3 ppb for two days followed by differentiation into dopaminergic (DA) neurons in ATZ-free medium. We then examined the morphology, activity, pathological protein aggregation, and transcriptomic changes of differentiated DA neurons. We observed significant decrease in the complexity of neurite network, increase of neuronal activity, and elevated tau- and α-synuclein (aSyn) pathologies after ATZ exposure. The ATZ-induced neuronal changes observed here align with pathological characteristics in Parkinson's disease (PD). Transcriptomic analysis further corroborates our findings; and collectively provides a strong evidence base that low-concentration ATZ exposure during development can elicit increased risk of neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Ethnopharmacological relevance
Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil. (UR), a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, plays an active role in neuroprotection. Clinical medication and modern pharmacological studies have proved the efficacy of UR against Parkinson's disease (PD), with alkaloids being recognized as the main bioactive components. But the therapeutic effect and mechanism of U. rhynchophylla alkaloid extract (URA) against PD need further exploration.
Aim of study
The study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect and potential mechanism of URA on PD.
Materials and methods
LC-MS methodology was used to evaluate the chemical constituents of URA. The anti-PD activity of URA in vivo was measured on the mouse and rat models of PD. Neuroprotective effect of URA on PC12 cells was measured by MTT assay. Dopamine (DA) and its metabolites were detected by LC-MS for probing the protection ability on dopaminergic neurons. The differentially expressed proteins between model group and URA administrated group were analyzed by proteomics, suggesting oxidative phosphorylation as possible pathway of URA. Considering the critical role of mitochondria in oxidative phosphorylation, JC-1 staining, MitoSOX staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels detection were used to analyze the effects of URA on mitochondrial morphology and function. Biolayer interferometry (BLI) was used to search for the possible UCHL1-bonding compounds in URA.
Results
URA significantly mitigated the behavioural defects by improving coordination, shortening the time to climb down the whole pole (T-LA) and increasing the forelimbs’ muscle strength of MPTP-induced PD mice and 6-OHDA-induced PD rats. In addition, URA improved tyrosine hydroxylase expression in dopaminergic neurons by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and thus increased the neurotransmitter levels of DA and relevant metabolites. Furthermore, URA promoted mitophagy as reflected by a significant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, an increase in ATP levels and clearance of damaged mitochondria. Subsequently, Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1 (UCHL1), which is associated with the mitochondrial dysfunction in PD, is suggested to be a promising target based on the proteomics result, and proved by the blocked protective effects of URA by UCHL1 inhibitor. Furthermore, hirsuteine (HTE) was identified as a potential active compound of URA binding to UCHL1 by BLI, and the binding capacity and site were verified by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and molecular docking.
Conclusion
This work demonstrates that URA exerts effective neuroprotective activity against PD via activation of mitophagy with the involvement of UCHL1, and HTE may be a potential active compound of URA.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent movement disorder characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Currently, there are no effective treatments to cure or slow the progression of PD, highlighting an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. Emerging evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) are potential candidates for PD treatment. This study investigates a therapeutic strategy involving FGF21 delivered via mouse MSCs in the PD model of mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). FGF21-overexpressing MSCs were administered intranasally, either before or after MPTP treatment in mice. Intranasally delivered FGF21-overexpressing MSCs efficiently migrated to the injured substantia nigra, ameliorated MPTP-induced PD-like motor deficits, reinstated dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and nerve terminals in the striatum, as well as normalized brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and FGF21 levels. In contrast, MSCs not overexpressing FGF21 showed limited or no impact on these parameters. In a PD cellular model of MPP+-treated SH-SY5Y cells, FGF21-overexpressing MSCs showed enhanced PD cell viability. Treatment with conditioned medium from FGF21-overexpressing MSCs or exogenous FGF21 prevented cell death, reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and restored neuroprotective proteins, including phospho-Akt, BDNF, and Bcl-2. These findings indicate that intranasal delivery of FGF21-overexpressing MSCs holds promise as a potential PD therapy, likely through activating the Akt-BDNF-Bcl-2 pathway, normalizing mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitigating dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Further clinical investigations are essential to validate these promising findings.

Abstract: Introduction
By using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and Q-Space imaging technology, this research analyzes the imaging characteristics of white matter fibers in the primary motor cortex and posterior limbs of the subcortical internal capsule in parkinsonian patients with motor disorders. The correlation among the changes in axonal function and structure in the cerebral cortex and subcortical cortex and motor disorder is further revealed.
Methods
First, motor function and clinical condition of 20 patients with Parkinson's disease is assessed the third section of the Unified Parkinson's Scale and H&Y Parkinson's Clinical Staging Scale. Magnetic resonance (MR) scanning is performed with 1H-MRS. Secondly, the range maps of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA), Choline (Cho), and Creatine (Cr) in the region of interest (the primary motor area of anterior central cortex gyrus, i.e. M1 region) are obtained, and the ratios of NAA/Cr and Cho are calculated. Third, Q-Space MR diffusion imaging technique is used to collect Q-Space images, and a Dsi-studio workstation is used to post-process the images. The fraction anisotropic (FA), generalized fraction anisotropic (GFA), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) parameters of Q-Space in the primary motor cortex and the region of interest in the posterior limb of the internal capsule are obtained. Finally, the parameters of MRS and Q-Space in the experimental group and the control group are further analyzed by SPSS statistical software.
Results
After assessing with Parkinson's score scale, there is obvious motor dysfunction in the experimental group. The average clinical stage of H&Y is 3.0 ± 0.31. In the analysis of MRS data, the ratio of NAA/Cr in the primary motor area of the anterior central gyrus in the experimental group is significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). In the ADC map obtained by Q-Space imaging technique, the ADC value in the primary motor area of the anterior central gyrus in the experimental group is higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05), and the difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05). There is no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group (P > 0.05) in FA and GFA values of the posterior limb of capsule to characterize the characteristics of white matter fibers.
Conclusions
In parkinsonian patients with motor dysfunction, there are apparent functional and structural changes in the primary motor area neurons and peripheral white matter of the anterior central gyrus, and no obvious damage to the axonal structure of the descending fibers in the cortex.

Abstract: Summary
Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived midbrain dopaminergic cells (mDACs) represent a promising source for autologous cell therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but standardized regulatory criteria are essential for clinical translation. In this pre-clinical study, we generated multiple clinical-grade hiPSC lines from freshly biopsied fibroblasts of four sporadic PD patients using episomal reprogramming and differentiated them into mDACs using a refined 21-day protocol. Rigorous evaluations included whole-genome/exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and in vivo studies, including a 39-week Good Laboratory Practice-compliant mouse safety study. While mDACs from all lines met safety criteria, mDACs from one patient failed to improve rodent behavioral outcomes, underscoring inter-individual variability. Importantly, in vitro assessments did not reliably predict in vivo efficacy, identifying dopaminergic fiber density as a key efficacy criterion. These findings support comprehensive quality control guidelines for autologous cell therapy and pave the way for a clinical trial with eight sporadic PD patients, scheduled to commence in 2025.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with significant clinical implications. Early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for timely intervention and personalized treatment. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have emerged as promis-ing tools for improving PD diagnosis. This review paper presents a detailed analysis of the current state of ML and DL-based PD diagnosis, focusing on voice, handwriting, and wave spiral datasets. The study also evaluates the effectiveness of various ML and DL algorithms, including classifiers, on these datasets and highlights their potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and aiding clinical decision-making. Additionally, the paper explores the identifi-cation of biomarkers using these techniques, offering insights into improving the diagnostic process. The discussion encompasses different data formats and commonly employed ML and DL methods in PD diagnosis, providing a comprehensive overview of the field. This review serves as a roadmap for future research, guiding the development of ML and DL-based tools for PD detection. It is expected to benefit both the scientific community and medical practitioners by advancing our understanding of PD diagnosis and ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Background
Reported orthostatic hypotension (OH) prevalence in Parkinson's disease (PD) varies widely, with few studies evaluating specifically neurogenic-OH (nOH). The ratio of orthostatic heart rate (HR) to systolic blood pressure (SBP) change (Δ) is a valid screening method to stratify nOH/non-nOH but has had minimal epidemiologic application.
Objective
To estimate the prevalence of nOH and non-nOH in the PPMI using the ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio and examine associations between nOH and various motor and non-motor measures.
Methods
Longitudinal orthostatic vitals and motor and non-motor measures were extracted (baseline-month 48). Patients were consensus criteria classified as OH+/−, with ΔHR/ΔSBP sub-classification to nOH (ΔHR/ΔSBP < 0.5) or non-nOH (ratio ≥ 0.5). Prevalence was determined across visits. Independent linear mixed models tested associations between nOH/non-nOH and clinical variables.
Results
Of N = 907 PD with baseline orthostatic vitals, 3.9 % and 1.8 % exhibited nOH and non-nOH, respectively. Prevalence of nOH/non-nOH increased yearly (P = 0.012, chi-square), though with modest magnitude (baseline: 5.6 % [95 % CI: 4.3–7.3 %]; month 48: 8.6 % [6.4–11.5 %]). nOH patients were older than PD with no OH and nOH was associated with greater impairment of motor and independent functioning than non-nOH/OH- groups. Cognitive function and typical OH symptoms were worse in PD + OH, generally.
Conclusions
nOH prevalence was greater than non-nOH in the PPMI early PD cohort, with modest prevalence increase over time. Our findings are consistent with prior studies of large cohorts that evaluated nOH, specifically. Those with early PD and nOH were likelier to be older and suffer from greater motor and functional impairment, but OH presence was generally associated with more cognitive impairment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by chronic and progressive symptoms; it is more prevalent in men than in women. The sex-specific influence of the intestinal microbiota has been associated with some neurodegenerative diseases, but the relationship with PD is currently unclear. In this study, we treated mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish a PD mouse model, and we utilised an antibiotic cocktail (Abx) to deplete the intestinal microbiota to evaluate the influence of the intestinal microbiota on male and female PD mice. MPTP treatment obviously caused bradykinesia and low mobility in female and male mice. Meanwhile, Abx treatment exerted a greater effect on male mice than female mice. Western blotting and immunofluorescence revealed that male mice treated with MPTP had higher expression of α-synuclein and proteins related to neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation based on activation of glial cells and the TLR4–MyD88 signalling pathway. The sex-specific differences could be due to the different composition of the intestinal microbiota. Specifically, female mice had significantly higher abundance of Allobaculum, Turicibacter and Ruminococcus than male mice. Moreover, the abundance of the probiotic genus Bifidobacterium showed opposite trends in male and female mice. Our results indicate that the intestinal microbiota has an important effect on PD mice, especially male mice, by influencing neuroinflammation through the microbiota–gut–brain axis. In the future, there should be a focus on providing more reliable evidence for the pathogenesis and precise treatment of PD.

Abstract: Background
Mitochondria are the metabolic hubs of cells, regulating energy production and antigen presentation, which are essential for activation, proliferation, and function of immune cells. Recent evidence indicates that mitochondrial antigen presentation may have an impact on diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and autoimmune diseases. However, there is limited knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate the presentation of mitochondrial antigens in these diseases.
Methods
In the current study, RNA sequencing was performed on labial minor salivary gland (LSG) from 25 patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and 14 non-pSS aged controls. Additionally, we obtained gene expression omnibus datasets associated with PD patients from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), ESTIMATE and Spearman correlations were conducted to explore the association between mitochondrial related genes and the immune system. Furthermore, we applied weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify hub mitochondria-related genes and investigate the correlated networks in both diseases. Single cell transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR) were used to verify the activation of the hub mitochondria-related pathway. Pearson correlations and the CIBERSORT algorithms were employed to further reveal the correlation between hub mitochondria-related pathways and immune infiltration.
Results
The transcriptome analysis revealed the presence of overlapping mitochondria-related genes and mitochondrial DNA damage in patients with pSS and PD. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), the senescence marker p53, and the inflammatory markers CD45 and Bcl-2 were found to be regionally distributed in LSGs of pSS patients. WGCNA analysis identified the STING pathway as the central mitochondria-related pathway closely associated with the immune system. Single cell analysis, IHC staining, and qRT-PCR confirmed the activation of the STING pathway. Subsequent, bioinformatic analysis revealed the proportion of infiltrating immune cells in the STING-high and STING-low groups of pSS and PD. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the association of the STING pathway with innate and adaptive immune cells, as well as functional cells, in the immune microenvironment of PD and pSS.
Conclusion
Our study uncovered a central pathway that connects mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune microenvironment in PD and pSS, potentially offering valuable insights into therapeutic targets for these conditions.

Abstract: Introduction
The differential diagnosis of early Parkinson's disease (PD) by a single biomarker is still challenging due to its symptomatic overlap with other neurological diseases. Increasing evidences support the use of saliva biomarkers of neurodegeneration, including microRNAs and α-synuclein (α-syn) seeding activity, to diagnose patients with idiopathic PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Our previous study confirmed the salivary microRNA-29a-3p (miRNA-29a-3p) and α-syn seeding activity could differentiate PD and MSA from healthy control subjects (HCs) and patients with essential tremor (ET).
Methods
We set up α-syn real-time quaking induced conversion seed amplification assay (α-syn RT-QuIC SAA) in 203 participants from the Peking University First Hospital with PD (n = 101), MSA (n = 32), ET (n = 17) and healthy control subjects (HCs, n = 53). We also determined miRNA-29a-3p in saliva by real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and, in 155 participants (36HCs, 80PD, 22MSA, 17ET).
Results
Sensitivity of RT-QuIC seed amplification assay (SAA) for PD was 70.30 %, for MSA was 56.25 % and specificity for healthy controls was 92.45 %. The expression level of saliva miRNA-29a-3p was significantly decreased in patients with PD (p < 0.001) and MSA (p < 0.0001), and allowed differentiation with HCs (PD vs. HCs, AUC 0.69; MSA vs. HCs, AUC 0.95). Sensitivity of salivary miRNA-29a-3p for PD and MSA were 70.00 % and 95.45 %, respectively, and specificity for PD and MSA were 77.23 % and 80.56 %, respectively. By combining the salivary α-syn RT-QuIC SAA with miRNA-29a-3p, sensitivity for PD vs. HCs increasing to 75.00 %, while sensitivity for MSA vs. HCs increasing to 90.00 %. Specificity was 91.67 % for PD and 88.89 % for MSA after combining assessment of salivary α-syn RT-QuIC SAA. Salivary α-syn RT-QuIC SAA yielded 100.00 % sensitivity and 79.21 % specificity for PD vs. ET, and 100.00 % sensitivity and 65.63 % specificity for MSA vs. ET. Salivary miRNA-29a-3p provied 88.24 % sensitivity and 48.75 % specificity for PD vs. ET and 86.36 % sensitivity and 88.24 % specificity for MSA vs. ET. The combined assessment of saliva markers provided a better diagnostic value for ET vs. synucleinopathies (ET vs. PD: 88.24 % sensitivity and 81.25 % specificity; ET vs. MSA: 94.12 % sensitivity and 90.00 % specificity) than RT-QuIC SAA alone, or miRNA-29a-3p alone. The combination of lag phase and miRNA-29a-3p could add higher specificity (85.71 %) which increased approximately 40 percent (specificity: miRNA-29a-3p 47.50 %, lag phase 48.98 %) for discriminating PD from MSA. However, the sensitivity of combining these two methods was 61.11 %, which was lower than lag phase alone (89.66 %) or miRNA-29a-3p alone (95.45 %).
Conclusions
This study confirmed that saliva, a non-invasive biofluid in synucleinopathies possessed potential diagnostic power between PD, MSA, ET and normal controls. We show the combined value of saliva miRNA-29a-3p and saliva α-syn RT-QuIC SAA in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinsonism.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder whose prevalence rises with age, yet clinical diagnosis is still a challenging task due to similar manifestations of other neurodegenerative movement disorders. In untreated patients or those with unclear responses to medication, correct percentages of early diagnoses go as low as 26%. Technology has been used in various forms to facilitate discerning between persons with PD and healthy individuals, but much less work has been dedicated to separating PD and atypical parkinsonisms.
Methods
A wearable system was developed based on inertial sensors that capture the movements of fingers during repetitive finger tapping. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier was used on features extracted from gyroscope recordings for quick aid in differential diagnostics, discerning patients with PD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and healthy controls (HC).
Results
The overall classification accuracy achieved was 85.18% in the multiclass setup. MSA and HC groups were the easiest to discern (100%), while PSP was the most elusive diagnosis, as some patients were incorrectly assigned to MSA and HC groups.
Conclusions
The system shows potential for use as a tool for quick diagnostic aid, and in the era of big data, offers a means of standardization of data collection that could allow scientists to aggregate multi-center data for further research.

Abstract: Neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation are key factors involved in the pathological changes of Parkinson's disease (PD). Sophoricoside (SOP) has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis effects in various diseases. However, the role of SOP in PD has not been reported. In this experiment, we found that oral administration of SOP alleviated weight loss and motor symptoms in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-injected mice. Further studies revealed that SOP inhibited inflammatory responses and neuronal apoptosis in the midbrain region of MPTP-injected mice. In vitro mechanistic study, we found that SOP exerts neuroprotective effects through a two-sided action. On the one hand, SOP inhibits Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in microglia by inhibiting the Nuclear factor kappa-B(NF-κB) pathway. On the other hand, SOP inhibits 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating the Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Thus SOP is expected to be a potential therapeutic agent for PD by targeting neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substania nigra (SN) and is associated with progressive motor impairment. PD is classified into familial and sporadic forms. The first genetic association studies in PD reported the involvement of Synuclein alpha (SNCA) mutations in the pathobiology of familial PD. Subsequent studies suggested mutations in PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), PARKIN, leucine repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2), and DJ-1 causing familial PD. In addition, kinase dysregulation has been embroiled in the pathogenesis of PD. The genome-editing mechanism CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) has recently influenced industry and scientific discoveries and is expected to expedite neurodegenerative disease research. This review will discuss the structure, function, and history of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system. Moreover, it summarizes genes-encoding kinases involved in PD pathogenesis and targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 technology, including LRRK2, PINK1, Protein kinase C-delta (PKC-γ), and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). We provide an overview of novel kinases to be targeted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system such as G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), cyclin-G-associated kinases (GAKs), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), c-ABL, and rearranged during transfection (RET) receptors. Additionally, we will explain the off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 system and how to address them. Also, we will shed light on the associated challenges and future directions that are enabling the efficient use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in kinases research in PD. In conclusion, gene editing, in addition to gene therapy, might be a possible promising strategy for PD therapy.

Abstract: Introduction
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disorder. Although diverse biomarkers have been established for Parkinson's disease (PD), no widely accepted markers have been identified in MSA. Pyruvate and lactate are the end-product of glycolysis and crucial for brain metabolism. However, their correlation with MSA remains unclear. Moreover, it is elusive how lifestyles modify these metabolites.
Methods
To investigate the correlation and diagnostic value of plasma pyruvate and lactate levels in MSA and PD. Moreover, we explored how lifestyle-related metabolites interact with these metabolites in determining the disease risk. We assayed the 3 metabolites in pyruvate/lactate and 6 in the tea/coffee metabolic pathways by targeted mass spectrometry and evaluate their interactions and performance in diagnosis and differentiation between MSA and PD.
Results
We found that 7 metabolites were significantly different between MSA, PD and healthy controls (HCs). Particularly, pyruvate was increased in PD while significantly decreased in MSA patients. Moreover, the tea/coffee metabolites were negatively associated with the pyruvate level in HCs, but not in MSA and PD patients. Using machine-learning models, we showed that the combination of pyruvate and tea/coffee metabolites diagnosed MSA (AUC = 0.878) and PD (AUC = 0.833) with good performance. Additionally, pyruvate had good performance in distinguishing MSA from PD (AUC = 0.860), and the differentiation increased (AUC = 0.922) when combined with theanine and 1,3-dimethyluric acid.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that pyruvate correlates reversely with MSA and PD, and may play distinct roles in their pathogenesis, which can be modified by lifestyle-related tea/coffee metabolites.

Abstract: Background
White matter (WM) tract alterations are early signs of cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) patients. Fixel-based analysis (FBA) has advantages over traditional diffusion tensor imaging in managing complex and crossing fibers. We used FBA to measure fiber-specific changes in patients with PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and PD normal cognition (PD-NC).
Methods
Seventy-one patients with PD without dementia were included: 39 PD-MCI and 32 PD-NC. All underwent diffusion-weighted imaging, clinical examinations, and tests to evaluate their cognitive function globally and in five cognitive domains. FBA was used to investigate fiber-tract alterations and compare PD-MCI with PD-NC subjects. Correlations with each cognitive test were analyzed.
Results
Patients with PD-MCI were significantly older (p = 0.044), had a higher male-to-female ratio (p = 0.006) and total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score (p = 0.001). All fixel-based metrics were significantly reduced within the body of the corpus callosum and superior corona radiata in PD-MCI patients (family-wise error-corrected P value < 0.05) compared with PD-NC patients. The cingulum, superior longitudinal fasciculi, and thalamocortical circuit exhibited predominantly fiber-bundle cross-section (FC) changes. In regression analysis, reduced FC values in cerebellar circuits were associated with poor motor function in PD-MCI patients and poor picture-naming ability in PD-NC patients.
Conclusions
PD-MCI patients have significant WM alterations compared with PD-NC patients. FBA revealed these changes in various bundle tracts, helping us to better understand specific WM changes that are functionally implicated in PD cognitive decline. FBA is potentially useful in detecting early cognitive decline in PD.

Abstract: The olfactory bulb is involved early in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), which is consistent with the early onset of olfactory dysfunction. Identifying the molecular mechanisms through which PD affects the olfactory bulb could lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of olfactory dysfunction in PD. We specifically aimed to assess gene expression changes, affected pathways and co-expression network by whole transcriptomic profiling of the olfactory bulb in subjects with clinicopathologically defined PD. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on frozen human olfactory bulbs of 20 PD and 20 controls without dementia or any other neurodegenerative disorder, from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative disorders and the Brain and Body Donation Program. Differential expression analysis (19 PD vs 19 controls) revealed 2164 significantly differentially expressed genes (1090 upregulated and 1074 downregulated) in PD. Pathways enriched in downregulated genes included oxidative phosphorylation, olfactory transduction, metabolic pathways, and neurotransmitters synapses while immune and inflammatory responses as well as cellular death related pathways were enriched within upregulated genes. An overrepresentation of microglial and astrocyte-related genes was observed amongst upregulated genes, and excitatory neuron-related genes were overrepresented amongst downregulated genes. Co-expression network analysis revealed significant modules highly correlated with PD and olfactory dysfunction that were found to be involved in the MAPK signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cholinergic synapse, and metabolic pathways. LAIR1 (leukocyte associated immunoglobulin like receptor 1) and PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) were identified as hub genes with a high discriminative power between PD and controls reinforcing an important role of neuroinflammation in the olfactory bulb of PD subjects. Olfactory identification test score positively correlated with expression of genes coding for G-coupled protein, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic receptor proteins and negatively correlated with genes for proteins expressed in glial olfactory ensheathing cells. In conclusion, this study reveals gene alterations associated with neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and disruptions of factors involved in the initiation of olfactory transduction signaling that may be involved in PD-related olfactory dysfunction.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurological disorder characterized by the impairment of the motor system, resulting in symptoms such as resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, difficulty with gait, and postural instability. The occurrence of striatal dopamine insufficiency can be attributed to a notable decline in dopaminergic neurons inside the substantia nigra pars compacta. Additionally, the development of Lewy bodies serves as a pathological hallmark of PD. While current therapy approaches for PD aim to preserve dopaminergic neurons or replenish dopamine levels in the brain, it is important to acknowledge that achieving complete remission of the condition remains elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miR) are a class of small, non-coding ribonucleic acids involved in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The miRNAs play a crucial part in the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodegenerative illnesses, including PD. The aim of this review is to explore the role of miRNAs in regulating genes associated with the onset and progression of PD, investigate the potential of miRNAs as a diagnostic tool, assess the effectiveness of targeting specific miRNAs as an alternative therapeutic strategy to impede disease advancement, and discuss the utilization of newly developed nanoparticles for delivering miRNAs as neurodegenerative therapies.

Abstract: The severity evaluation of Parkinson's disease (PD) is of great significance for the treatment of PD. However, existing methods either have limitations based on prior knowledge or are invasive methods. To propose a more generalized severity evaluation model, this paper proposes an explainable 3D multi-head attention residual convolution network. First, we introduce the 3D attention-based convolution layer to extract video features. Second, features will be fed into LSTM and residual backbone networks, which can be used to capture the contextual information of the video. Finally, we design a feature compression module to condense the learned contextual features. We develop some interpretable experiments to better explain this black-box model so that it can be better generalized. Experiments show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis performance. The proposed lightweight but effective model is expected to serve as a suitable end-to-end deep learning baseline in future research on PD video-based severity evaluation and has the potential for large-scale application in PD telemedicine.

Abstract: GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis occurs in the nigrostriatal pathway in Parkinson’s disease animals, yet the role of GSDMD in neuroinflammation and death of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease remains elusive. Here, our in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that GSDMD, as a pyroptosis executor, contributed to glial reaction and death of dopaminergic neurons across different Parkinson’s disease models. The ablation of the Gsdmd attenuated Parkinson’s disease damage by reducing dopaminergic neuronal death, microglial activation, and detrimental transformation. Disulfiram, an inhibitor blocking GSDMD pore formation, efficiently curtailed pyroptosis, thereby lessening the pathology of Parkinson’s disease. Additionally, a modification in GSDMD was identified in the blood of Parkinson’s disease patients in contrast to healthy subjects. Therefore, the detected alteration in GSDMD within the blood of Parkinson’s disease patients and the protective impact of disulfiram could be promising for the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches against Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Introduction
Idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found to have changes in cerebral perfusion and overlap of some of the lesioned brain areas. However, a consensus regarding the specific location and diagnostic significance of these cerebral blood perfusion alternations remains elusive in both iRBD and PD. The present study evaluated the patterns of cerebral blood flow changes in iRBD and PD.
Material and methods
A total of 59 right-handed subjects were enrolled, including 15 patients with iRBD, 20 patients with PD, and 24 healthy controls (HC). They were randomly divided into groups at a ratio of 4 to 1 for training and testing. A PASL sequence was employed to obtain quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps. The CBF values were calculated from these acquired maps. In addition, AutoGluon was employed to construct a classifier for CBF features selection and classification. An independent t-test was performed for CBF variations, with age and sex as nuisance variables. The performance of the feature was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A significance level of P < 0.05 was considered significant. CBF in several brain regions, including the left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri and the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG), showed significant differences between PD and HC, demonstrating good classification performance. The combined model that integrates all features achieved even higher performance with an AUC of 0.9380. Additionally, CBF values in multiple brain regions, including the right MOG and the left angular gyrus, displayed significant differences between PD and iRBD. Particularly, CBF values in the left angular gyrus exhibited good performance in classifying PD and iRBD. The combined model achieved improved performance, with an AUC of 0.8533. No significant differences were found in brain regions when comparing CBF values between iRBD and HC subjects.
Conclusions
ASL-based quantitative CBF change features can offer reliable biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis of PD. Regarding the characteristic of CBF in the right MOG, it is anticipated to serve as an imaging biomarker for predicting the progression of iRBD to PD.

Abstract: The current study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of sinapic acid (SA) administration in alleviating Parkinson's disease (PD) features, focusing on its effects in amelioration of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling, oxidative stress, and alpha-synucleinopathy in chronic ROT-induced PD rats. PD was induced using 11 ROT injections (1.5 mg/kg/48h; s.c.). One day following the fifth ROT dose, rats started treatment with SA (10 mg/kg), SA (20 mg/kg), SA (40 mg/kg), or L-dopa/carbidopa (100/10 mg/kg) daily via oral gavage for 21 consecutive days, followed by assessment of neurobehavioral parameters and subsequent histopathological and neurochemical analyses. Treatment with a high dose of SA amended ROT-induced locomotor deficits with significantly improved open-field ambulation, grooming, and rearing behavior, as well as increased cylinder wall forelimb placements, and prolonged rotarod fall-off latency. Additionally, SA treatment protected nigral dopaminergic neurons from ROT-induced neurodegeneration and dose-dependently preserved nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoexpression. Furthermore, SA treated rats showed markedly improved striatal dopamine (DA) content and diminished striatal alpha synuclein (α-Syn) overexpression. Additionally, SA treatment provided antioxidant properties as evidenced by improved striatal GSH/SOD/Catalase and suppressed MDA levels. Notably, SA administration resulted in significant, dose-dependent attenuation of ER stress sensors PERK, eIF2α, CHOP/GADD135, IRE1α, and ATF6 signaling. These findings provide novel in vivo insights into SA's beneficial neuroprotective properties in amelioration of ROT-induced ER stress via modulation of all three UPR branches, particularly the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP signaling axis, and establishes SA as a promising neurotherapeutic candidate for possible management of PD.

Abstract: Auranofin (AUF) is a gold-based compound that has demonstrated a wide range of biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects. However, the neuronal use of AUF is restricted due to its low bioavailability. Thus, to improve blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration and investigate its antiparkinsonian impact, the researchers developed AUF-loaded hybrid nanoparticles (AUFHNPs). This research delves into the neuroprotective potential of AUFHNPs against rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD). The MTT assay, Acridine orange/Ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis were performed on SH-SY5Y lines. Also, AUFHNPs were prepared and characterized. For the in-vivo study, AUF, its NPs and rotenone were administered for 28 days, and behavioral parameters were performed on day 27 and 28. On the 29th day, animals were sacrificed, and brains were isolated for biochemical assessment, apoptotic and inflammatory markers evaluation, histopathology, and molecular examination. In-vitro results showed that AUF significantly restored cell viability and reduced apoptosis. Spherical-shaped NPs were observed under FE-SEM/TEM analysis. Administration of AUFHNPs in rats significantly restored motor activity and neuronal morphological changes by phosphorylating GSK-3β to increase the expression of Nrf2/HO-1. This study concludes that developing AUFHNPs increases AUF's bioavailability in the brain and exerts neuroprotection via modulating GSK-3β/Nrf2/HO-1 pathways.

Abstract: Objective
To estimate the sequence of several common biomarker changes in Parkinson's disease (PD) using a novel data-driven method.
Methods
We included 374 PD patients and 169 healthy controls (HC) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Biomarkers, including the left putamen striatal binding ratio (SBR), right putamen SBR, left caudate SBR, right caudate SBR, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) α-synuclein, and serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), were selected in our study. The discriminative event-based model (DEBM) was utilized to model the sequence of biomarker changes and establish the disease progression timeline. The estimated disease stages for each subject were obtained through cross-validation. The associations between the estimated disease stages and the clinical symptoms of PD were explored using Spearman's correlation.
Results
The left putamen is the earliest biomarker to become abnormal among the selected biomarkers, followed by the right putamen, CSF α-synuclein, right caudate, left caudate, and serum NfL. The estimated disease stages are significantly different between PD and HC and yield a high accuracy for distinguishing PD from HC, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.97–0.99), a sensitivity of 0.95, and a specificity of 0.92. Moreover, the estimated disease stages correlate with motor experiences of daily living, motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and anxiety in PD patients.
Conclusion
We determined the sequence of several common biomarker changes in PD using DEBM, providing data-driven evidence of the disease progression of PD.

Abstract: Background
Assessment of gait function in People with Parkinson Disease (PwPD) is an important tool for monitoring disease progression in PD. While comprehensive gait analysis has become increasingly popular, only one study, Hass et al. (2014), has established minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for one spatiotemporal variable (velocity) in PwPD.
Research Question
What are the MCIDs for velocity and additional spatiotemporal variables, including mean, variability, and asymmetry of step length, time, and width?
Methods
As part of a larger clinic-based initiative, 382 medicated, ambulatory PwPD walked on an instrumented walkway during routine clinical visits. Distribution and anchor-based methods (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III, Modified Hoehn and Yahr, and the mobility subsection of the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire) were used to calculate MCIDs for variables of interest in a cross-sectional approach.
Results
Distribution measures for all variables are presented. Of nine gait variables, four were significantly associated with every anchor and pooled to the following values: velocity (8.2 cm/s), step length mean (3.6 cm), step length variability (0.7%), and step time variability (0.67%).
Significance
The finalized MCID for velocity (8.2 cm/s) was nearly half of the MCID of 15 cm/s reported by Hass et al., potentially due to differences in calculations. These results allow for evaluations of effectiveness of interventions by providing values that are specific to changes in gait for PwPD. Alterations of methodology including different versions of clinical or walking assessments, and/or different calculation and selection of gait variables necessitate careful reasoning when using presented MCIDs.

Abstract: The imbalance of nitric oxide (NO) homeostasis in the brain is closely related to the occurrence of Parkinson's disease (PD). Therefore, revealing the fluctuation of NO in brain is crucial for understanding the pathophysiological processes. However, currently developed NO probes are unsuitable for this purpose due to their poor blood-brain barrier permeability. Herein, a fluorescent probe (PO-NH) with blood-brain barrier crossing capability and high selectivity for NO was developed. Under the NO mediation, the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process of the probe was blocked, giving an intensive fluorescence enhancement (F/F0 = 15). Moreover, PO-NH can be used to effectively monitor changes in intracellular NO levels. Significantly, due to excellent blood-brain barrier crossing ability and near-infrared (NIR) emission, PO-NH is suitable for in vivo imaging of NO in the brain and illustrating with the deterioration of PD, the level of NO gradually increased in the brain of PD mice. We believe that PO-NH may provide a beneficial tool for understanding the biological function of NO in the brain and revealing the complex connection between NO and PD.

Abstract: Objective
this study was to analyze the brain functional network of end-of-dose wearing-off (EODWO) in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) using a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data classification model.
Methods
one hundred PD patients were recruited and assigned to control (Ctrl) group (39 cases without EODWO) and experimental (Exp) group (61 cases with EODWO). The data classification model based on a CNN was employed to assist the analysis of the changes in brain functional network structure in the two groups. The CNN-based fMRI data classification model was primarily based on a CNN architecture, with improvements made to the initialization of convolutional kernel parameters. Firstly, a structure based on restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was constructed, followed by the initialization of convolutional kernel parameters. Subsequently, the model underwent training. Utilizing the data analysis module within the GRETNA toolbox, extracted feature sets were analyzed, including local measures such as betweenness centrality (BC) and degree centrality (DC), as well as global measures such as global efficiency (Eg) and local efficiency (Eloc).
Results
as sparsity increased, there was a gradual upward trend observed in Eg; however, the values of Eg in both brain functional networks remained relatively stable within the range of 0.2–0.5. The Eg value of the Ctrl group’s whole-brain functional network was 0.17 ± 0.02, while that of the Exp group’s whole-brain functional network was 0.17 ± 0.03, with no significant difference between them (P>0.05). The functional DC value of the superior frontal gyrus in the Exp group (8.71 ± 2.56) was significantly lower than that of the Ctrl group (13.32 ± 3.22), whereas the functional DC value of the anterior cingulate gyrus in the Exp group (19.33 ± 4.78) was significantly higher than that of the Ctrl group (15.21 ± 4.02) (P<0.05). There was no significant correlation observed between the functional DC value and levodopa or dopamine agonist therapy (DDT) in the Exp group, whereas the Ctrl group exhibited a significant positive correlation.
Conclusion
analysis conducted via a CNN-based fMRI data classification model revealed a correlation between the occurrence of EODWO in PD patients and functional impairments in the left precuneus. Additionally, the occurrence of EODWO may potentially diminish the plasticity of the central prefrontal dopamine.

Abstract: β-asarone, an effective volatile oil component of Acorus chinensis, has been found to hold beneficial effects on Parkinson's disease (PD), but its mechanism remains incompletely understood. Drosophila melanogaster with PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1) mutations, a prototype PD model, was used in this study. We found that calcium chelation profoundly alleviated a spectrum of PD symptoms. Whereas, calcium supplementation made the case worse, suggesting accumulated calcium contributes to progression of PD. β-asarone administration decreased Ca2+ level in PD flies, accompanied by alleviated behavioral and neural defects. Further study demonstrated that β-asarone downregulated L-type Ca2+ channels (Dmca1D), which was increased in PD flies. Besides, β-asarone decreased expression of 1,4,5 - trisphosphate receptor (Itpr), which is responsible for calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Knockdown of either Dmca1D or Itpr specifically in dopaminergic neurons alleviated behavioral and neural defects in PD flies. While overexpression of Itpr aggravated PD symptoms. The results indicated that increased intracellular calcium influx and release triggers dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in PD flies. And β-asarone prevents PD by restoring Ca2+ homeostasis. Overall, the study demonstrated that β-asarone can serve as a new prospective medication against PD or other diseases associated with dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis.

Abstract: Background
Physical capacity and physical activity are important aspects of physical functioning and quality of life in people with a chronic disease such as Parkinson disease (PD) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Both physical capacity and physical activity are currently measured in the clinic using standardized questionnaires and tests, such as the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). However, relying only on in-clinic tests is suboptimal since they offer limited information on how a person functions in daily life and how functioning fluctuates throughout the day. Wearable sensor technology may offer a solution that enables us to better understand true physical functioning in daily life.
Objective
We aim to study whether device-assisted versions of 6MWT and TUG, such that the tests can be performed independently at home using a smartwatch, is a valid and reliable way to measure the performance compared to a supervised, in-clinic test.
Methods
This is a decentralized, prospective, observational study including 100 people with PD and 100 with COPD. The inclusion criteria are broad: age ≥18 years, able to walk independently, and no co-occurrence of PD and COPD. Participants are followed for 15 weeks with 4 in-clinic visits, once every 5 weeks. Outcomes include several walking tests, cognitive tests, and disease-specific questionnaires accompanied by data collection using wearable devices (the Verily Study Watch and Modus StepWatch). Additionally, during the last 10 weeks of this study, participants will follow an aerobic exercise training program aiming to increase physical capacity, creating the opportunity to study the responsiveness of the remote 6MWT.
Results
In total, 89 people with PD and 65 people with COPD were included in this study. Data analysis will start in April 2024.
Conclusions
The results of this study will provide information on the measurement properties of the device-assisted 6MWT and TUG in the clinic and at home. When reliable and valid, this can contribute to a better understanding of a person’s physical capacity in real life, which makes it possible to personalize treatment options.

Abstract: Objectives
Participation is essential to DBS research, yet circumstances that affect diverse participation remain unclear. Here we evaluate factors impacting participation in an adaptive DBS study of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dystonia.
Methods
Twenty participants were implanted with a sensing-enabled DBS device (Medtronic Summit RC+S) that allows neural data streaming in naturalistic settings and encouraged to stream as much as possible for the first five months after surgery. Using standardized baseline data obtained through neuropsychological evaluation, we compared neuropsychological and social variables to streaming hours.
Results
Marital status and irritability significantly impacted streaming hours (estimate=136.7, bootstrapped (b) CIb=45.0 to 249.0, pb=0.016, and estimate=−95.1, CIb=−159.9 to −49.2, pb=0.027, respectively). These variables remained significant after multivariable analysis. Composite scores on verbal memory evaluations predicted the number of hours of data streamed (R2=0.284, estimate=67.7, CIb=20.1 to 119.9, pb=0.019).
Discussion
Verbal memory impairment, irritability, and lack of a caregiver may be associated with decreased participation. Further study of factors that impact research participation is critical to the sustained inclusion of diverse participants.

Abstract: Background
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) relieves motor symptoms, including levodopa-responsive gait disorders in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Traditionally, STN-DBS is not indicated to treat severe, clinically resistant axial symptoms. In this scenario, field H1 of Forel (FF) stimulation (FF-DBS) is likely a feasible option, given it improves motor symptoms, including freezing of gait (FOG), as shown by a short-term study. However, no data are available about the long-term effects of this therapy. Finally, no study has compared the long-term effects of FF and STN-DBS.
Objective
We report the long-term outcome (>five years) of bilateral FF-DBS in patients with PD. We also compare the effects of FF-DBS and STN-DBS on motor symptoms, cognition, and quality of life.
Materials and Methods
We studied 22 patients (ten with FF-DBS and 12 with STN-DBS). Motor symptoms, cognition, quality of life, and gait symptoms were assessed using the motor part of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS III), the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, the 39-item PD quality of life (PDQ-39), and the FOG questionnaire (FOG score) respectively. The levodopa equivalent daily dose was recorded. Comparisons of the FF and STN-DBS results were conducted.
Result
The mean follow-up was 6.18 years (95% CI: 5.57–6.78). Compared with the preoperative period, patients with FF had an average reduction of 32.2% in the MDS-UPDRS III scores (p < 0.01), a decrease of 35.3% in the FOG scores (p < 0.01), and an improvement of 25.9% in the PDQ-39 (p < 0.01). There was a 7.5% decrease in cognition (p < 0.01). Levodopa equivalent dose (LED) was reduced by 26.3% (p < 0.01). The STN group had an average reduction of 39.4% in the MDS-UPDRS III scores (p < 0.01), a decrease of 23.7% in the FOG scores (p < 0.01), and an improvement of 33.2% in the PDQ-39 scores (p < 0.01). Cognition decreased by 1.6% (p < 0.01) and LED by 15.06% (p = 0.02). Patients with FF-DBS were older than those with STN-DBS at the time of surgery: 61.2 years and 55.7 years, respectively (p = 0.02), and had longer duration of disease (p = 0.02). Patients with FF-DBS had a greater reduction in FOG (p = 0.02) than did the STN group and presented with a greater decrease in cognition (p < 0.01) after five years. STN-DBS had a greater effect on quality of life.
Conclusions
Both FF-DBS and STN-DBS relieved motor symptoms and improved quality of life over a long-term period. Patients with FF-DBS had a higher reduction in both FOG and in LED than did those with STN-DBS. These data support our hypothesis that FF-DBS is a safe and efficient option for treating motor symptoms in PD, including FOG in advanced stages.

Abstract: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical technique that involves the implantation of electrodes into specific areas of the brain to alleviate symptoms associated with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Animal models of Parkinson's disease have been used extensively to study the effectiveness of DBS in treating motor symptoms. In animal models of Parkinson's disease, DBS has been shown to improve motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. DBS is thought to work by modulating the activity of specific neural circuits involved in motor control. Animal studies have also provided insight into the optimal placement of DBS electrodes and the best stimulation parameters to use. Animal models have also been used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of DBS. Studies have shown that DBS can modulate the activity of various neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, glutamate, and GABA. DBS has also been shown to promote neuroplasticity, which may contribute to its beneficial effects. Overall, animal models of Parkinson's disease have played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying DBS and its potential therapeutic benefits. Further research using animal models will likely continue to provide important insights into the optimal use of DBS in treating Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Objective
To characterize sleep duration and investigate its association with quality of life among Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients.
Methods
In this multicenter cross-sectional study, 970 PD patients were divided into five groups based on self-reported sleep duration: <5, ≥5 to <6, ≥6 to <7, ≥7 to ≤8, and >8 h. The quality of life was evaluated using the 39-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Multivariable linear regression analysis, subgroup analysis, and mediation analysis were conducted to examine the association between sleep duration and quality of life.
Results
In multivariable linear regression model, patients with sleep duration (<5 h) had significantly higher PDQ-39 scores (β = 8.132, 95 % CI: 3.99 to 12.266), especially in mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort (p < 0.05). The association between sleep duration (<5 h) and worse quality of life was more pronounced in patients with higher HY stage, longer disease duration, and sleep disorders. Moreover, a significant indirect effect of sleep duration (<5 h) on quality of life was observed, with UPDRS I, UPDRS II, and UPDRS IV scores acting as mediators.
Conclusions
Short sleep duration (<5 h) is associated with worse quality of life among PD patients. This association was stronger among patients with advanced PD and sleep disorders, while non-motor symptoms and motor complications were identified as significant mediators in this association. These findings highlight the significance of adequate sleep duration and suitable interventions for sleep may help improve quality of life.

Abstract: The elevated activity of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The quest for effective LRRK2 inhibitors has been impeded by the formidable challenge of crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB). We leveraged structure-based de novo design and developed robust three-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models to predict BBB permeability, enhancing the likelihood of the inhibitor’s brain accessibility. Our strategy involved the synthesis of macrocyclic molecules by linking the two terminal nitrogen atoms of HG-10-102-01 with an alkyl chain ranging from 2 to 4 units, laying the groundwork for innovative LRRK2 inhibitor designs. Through meticulous computational and synthetic optimization of both biochemical efficacy and BBB permeability, 9 out of 14 synthesized candidates demonstrated potent low-nanomolar inhibition and significant BBB penetration. Further assessments of in vitro and in vivo effectiveness, coupled with pharmacological profiling, highlighted 8 as the promising new lead compound for PD therapeutics.

Abstract: The consequences of pain in early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) remain under appreciated even though pain may exert an increasingly negative impact on patient quality of life as motor and non-motor symptoms worsen. In this prospective study, we investigate the prevalence and severity of pain in 135 Vietnamese patients with EOPD from three medical centers using the King's PD Pain Scale (KPPS), the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). Pain was reported by 79.3%. The most common subtype of pain was musculoskeletal (70.1%), followed by nocturnal (43.9%), radicular (43.0%), chronic (42.1%), fluctuation-related (34.6%) and orofacial pain (16.8%). Most patients (74.8%) experienced more than one pain subtype. Fluctuation-related pain and orofacial pain were significantly more prevalent among patients with higher Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stages (3–5) versus lower H&Y stages (1–2). Pain subtype and severity were not significantly related to gender or age of PD onset. Patients with H&Y stages 3–5 had statistically significantly higher KPPS scores for fluctuation-related pain (p = 0.018) and radicular pain (p = 0.026). Independent associations were found between pain severity and age (p = 0.028), depression severity (p = 0.018), perceptual problems/hallucinations (p = 0.033) and sexual function (p = 0.024). Patients with depression and higher H&Y stages (3–5) had statistically significantly higher mean KPPS scores versus patients without depression and at lower H&Y stages (1–2). Pain may be more common and severe in EOPD patients than previously appreciated. Older age, depression, perceptual problems/hallucinations and sexual dysfunction were independently associated with higher pain severity.

Abstract: A highly accurate automated approach using a deep structured neural network was proposed to detect Parkinson's disease through voice samples. This cost-effective and non-invasive method aims to enhance diagnostic precision and assess the disease's stage of progression. The study addresses two classification problems: binary and multi-category classification. The binary classification deep structured neural network achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 97.6%. For multiclass classification, a Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) and a K- nearest neighbor technique for benchmarking, were utilized using a shared database. Nature Inspired Algorithm (NIA)-Genetic Algorithm was employed to optimize the initial feature set. The suggested deep structure neural network demonstrated a 93.7% accuracy in estimating the disease's stage, showing promising results. Further investigations are encouraged to explore the model's adaptability and pursue improved outcomes.

Abstract: Aims
Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a substantial clinical challenge due to the progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons in nigrostriatal pathway. In this study, human amniotic epithelial stem cells (hAESCs)-derived dopaminergic neuron-like cells (hAESCs-DNLCs) were generated, with the aim of providing new therapeutic approach to PD.
Materials and methods
hAESCs, which were isolated from discarded placentas, were induced to differentiate into hAESCs-DNLCs by following a “two stages” induction protocol. The differentiation efficiency was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunocytochemistry (ICC), and ELISA. Immunogenicity, cell viability and tumorigenicity of hAESCs-DNLC were analyzed before in vivo experiments. Subsequently, hAESCs-DNLCs were transplanted into PD rats, behavioral tests were monitored after graft, and the regeneration of DA neurons was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, to trace hAESCs-DNLCs in vivo, cells were pre-labeled with PKH67 green fluorescence.
Key findings
hAESCs were positive for pluripotent markers and highly expressed neural stem cells (NSCs) markers. Based on this, we established an induction method reliably generates hAESCs-DNLCs, which was evidenced by epithelium-to-neuron morphological changes, elevated expressions of neuronal and DA neuronal markers, and increased secretion of dopamine. Moreover, hAESCs-DNLCs maintained high cell viability, no tumorigenicity and low immunogenicity, suggesting hAESCs-DNLCs an attractive implant for PD therapy. Transplantation of hAESCs-DNLCs into PD rats significantly ameliorated motor disorders, as well as enhanced the reinnervation of TH+ DA neurons in nigrostriatal pathway.
Significance
Our study has demonstrated evident therapeutic effects of hAESCs-DNLCs, and provides a safe and promising solution for PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by pathogenesis involving mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective interventions to slow down the progression of PD. The mitochondrial protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2), which is implicated in neurodegeneration and serves as a biomarker for PD, has been reported to have neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress, but the potential molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. In this study, we uncovered a critical mechanism by which CHCHD2 protected neuronal cells against oxidative stress with the ferroptosis pathway playing a pivotal role, as determined through tandem mass tags (TMT)-based proteomic analysis. The overexpression of CHCHD2 was observed to enhance cell viability, reduce levels of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and upregulate the expression of the ferroptosis negative regulatory protein Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in PD cells. Conversely, CHCHD2 knockdown led to reduced cell viability, elevated lipid peroxidation, and a decreased expression of GPX4. Additionally, CHCHD2 overexpression ameliorated motor function impairment, reduced α-synuclein levels, and mitigated dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss in the substantia nigra and striatum of PD mice. Importantly, we show that the inhibitory effect of CHCHD2 on ferroptosis in PD is related to the GPX4 signaling pathway. In summary, our study elucidates the neuroprotective role of CHCHD2 in regulating the GPX4-related ferroptosis pathway in PD, providing new targets and ideas for future PD drug development and therapy.

Abstract: Auditory rhythm-based therapeutic interventions such as rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) are effective in improving gait and balance and preventing falls in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Research showing associated neuromodulatory effects of RAS on brain oscillations is also emerging. The neuromodulation may be induced by neural entrainment and cross-frequency oscillatory coupling. Auditory rhythm and RAS based interventions are potentially effective in improving other PD symptoms and can be extended to atypical parkinsonism.

Abstract: This chapter provides a comprehensive discussion of AtreMorine, a novel bioproduct with dual prophylactic and therapeutic effects, in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Specifically, the chapter builds on existing research, focusing on the role of epigenetic dysregulation and DNA methylation in PD. We further explain the diverse effects of AtreMorine, including its impact on basal dopamine levels, patient responsiveness, and the pharmacogenomic landscape. Clinical data show that AtreMorine not only elevates DA levels but also significantly increases DNA methylation, a key epigenetic marker that decreases in PD. Gender disparities in DA levels and dose-dependent responses to AtreMorine are also discussed. The influence of polymorphic variants in various gene categories on patient responsiveness to AtreMorine is also assessed, highlighting the potential of this bioproduct to modulate the pharmacoepigenetic network. The chapter concludes by advocating for a multifaceted approach to diagnosing and treating PD. This approach would integrate advances in pharmacoepigenetics and precision medicine, recognizing the intricate interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors in PD. By leveraging cutting-edge biomedical technologies and insights into pharmacoepigenetics, new opportunities in both early intervention and long-term care can be created, presenting a transformative potential for more effective management of PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic degenerative neurological disorder that tends to worsen over the years. It is characterized by the slow and progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain mainly and some other areas. The early and correct identification of PD is very important for timely treatment, which can slow the progression of the disease and also improve the patients' lives. On the other hand, conventional diagnostic techniques are subjected to errors and are often unable to detect the PD at the early stage. This is because they are primarily based on rash clinical assessments and subjective evaluations. The way out is a mechanized, reliable, and competent system that is able to properly diagnose Parkinson's disease based on the records in its relevant medical data. This study aims to enhance a deep learning model that uses Explainable Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the PD classification from healthcare data. The CNN technique makes the best use of preprocessed data-sets, which include vocal and movement rhythms, to learn a CNN model for classification. The model's accuracy was measured with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The experimental results presented a significant increase in precision of detection compared to the traditional methods, with a 95.5%% accuracy and 95% precision, a 94% recall, and a 94.4%% F1 score. The CNN-based model is a potentially effective tool for the timely and accurate detection of PD, especially if it is coupled with the right medication.

Abstract: Proteomic profiling is an effective way to identify biomarkers for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has direct connectivity with the brain and could be a source of finding biomarkers and their clinical implications. Comparative proteomic profiling has shown that a group of differentially displayed proteins exist. The studies performed using conventional and classical tools also supported the occurrence of these proteins. Many studies have highlighted the potential of CSF proteomic profiling for biomarker identification and their clinical applications. Some of these proteins are useful for disease diagnosis and prediction. Proteomic profiling of CSF also has immense potential to distinguish PD from similar neurodegenerative disorders. A few protein biomarkers help in fundamental knowledge generation and clinical interpretation. However, the specific biomarker of PD is not yet known. The use of proteomic approaches in clinical settings is also rare. A large-scale, multi-centric, multi-population and multi-continental study using multiple proteomic tools is warranted. Such a study can provide valuable, comprehensive and reliable information for a better understanding of PD and the development of specific biomarkers. The current article sheds light on the role of CSF proteomic profiling in identifying biomarkers of PD and their clinical implications. The article also explains the achievements, obstacles and hopes for future directions of this approach.

Abstract: People with Parkinson’s Disease (PwPD) usually experience several neuropsychiatric signs such as anxiety, depression, and negative emotions that contribute to disability and worsening of quality of life. Notwithstanding, the assessment of these symptoms are largely underrated, subjective and difficult due to a large overlapping with other PD symptoms, like hypomimia and bradikinesia. The aim and novelty of the current work is to study and validate a method for automatic emotion recognition in PwPD during daily living through autonomic signals acquired by acceptable and low-cost consumer technology. The best shallow learning algorithm and the best minimal feature set are individuated. 11 PwPD and 8 subjects with no history of neurological injury or illness were enrolled in the study. Participants were asked to watch video clips purposely selected to arouse emotions, and annotate arousal and valence of emotions triggered by video clips, while their heart rate, skin conductance, and temperature were recorded by a smartwatch. Smartwatch data was used for features extraction, while participants’ reported arousal and valence were used as gold-standard to train machine learning algorithms for emotion classification (low/high arousal, positive/negative valence). Different feature sets and different algorithms (i.e. decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) were evaluated to find the best solution for each group of participant. In each group of participants, it was possible to find a combination of feature set and algorithm to reach a classification accuracy greater than 90%. The Random Forest reached the best performance in both groups and for both valence and arousal. For each classification task (valence or arousal, PwPD or controls), the best model was selected and the minimal feature set was found by performing a recursive feature elimination based on the Shapley value. A lower accuracy of appraisal emerged for arousal compared to valence. Obtained results showed the feasibility of automatic emotion recognition in PwPDs through autonomic signals. Autonomic dysfunction in PwPDs may explain the lower arousal accuracy. The findings warrant confirmation from trials on larger samples and there are open issues to be deepened in future work.

Abstract: The design and development of an automated Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis framework still remains one of the most complex and crucial tasks in the present day. In the traditional works, various feature extraction + optimization + classification models are developed for accurately detecting the PD from the speech signals. Yet, it has the problems of computational expenses, increased time for processing the signals, complexity to understanding the system model, and error results. Therefore, the proposed work motivates to development of a unique and advanced Adaptive Intelligent Polar Bear (AIPB) Optimization-Quantized Contempo Neural Network (QCNN) model for PD diagnosis. Here, the Determinate Haar Wavelet (DHW) transformation technique is used for preprocessing the speech signals by removing the noise and improving the quality. Consequently, the Statistical Time Frequency Renyi (STFR) feature extraction model is used to extract the useful features related to the Parkinson’s disease. Then, the AIPB optimization algorithm is deployed to extract the most relevant features required for detecting PD. Then, the QCNN technique is used to accurately predict the speech signal as to whether healthy or PD is affected. To validate this framework, various PD speech signal datasets are used for analysis. Also, the obtained results are compared with the recent PD detection approaches by using various evaluation indicators.

Abstract: Background
The fastest-growing neurological disorder is Parkinson disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 10 million people worldwide. PD is typically treated with levodopa, an oral pill taken to increase dopamine levels, and other dopaminergic agonists. As the disease advances, the efficacy of the drug diminishes, necessitating adjustments in treatment dosage according to the patient’s symptoms and disease progression. Therefore, remote monitoring systems that can provide more detailed and accurate information on a patient’s condition regularly are a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to manage their medication. The Parkinson’s Remote Interactive Monitoring System (PRIMS), developed by PragmaClin Research Inc, was designed on the premise that it will be an easy-to-use digital system that can accurately capture motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD remotely.
Objective
We performed a usability evaluation in a simulated clinical environment to assess the ease of use of the PRIMS and determine whether the product offers suitable functionality for users in a clinical setting.
Methods
Participants were recruited from a user sign-up web-based database owned by PragmaClin Research Inc. A total of 11 participants were included in the study based on the following criteria: (1) being diagnosed with PD and (2) not being diagnosed with dementia or any other comorbidities that would make it difficult to complete the PRIMS assessment safely and independently. Patient users completed a questionnaire that is based on the Movement Disorder Society–sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Interviews and field notes were analyzed for underlying themes and topics.
Results
In total, 11 people with PD participated in the study (female individuals: n=5, 45%; male individuals: n=6, 55%; age: mean 66.7, SD 7.77 years). Thematic analysis of the observer’s notes revealed 6 central usability issues associated with the PRIMS. These were the following: (1) the automated voice prompts are confusing, (2) the small camera is problematic, (3) the motor test exhibits excessive sensitivity to the participant’s orientation and position in relation to the cameras, (4) the system poses mobility challenges, (5) navigating the system is difficult, and (6) the motor test exhibits inconsistencies and technical issues. Thematic analysis of qualitative interview responses revealed four central themes associated with participants’ perspectives and opinions on the PRIMS, which were (1) admiration of purpose, (2) excessive system sensitivity, (3) video instructions preferred, and (4) written instructions disliked. The average system usability score was calculated to be 69.2 (SD 4.92), which failed to meet the acceptable system usability score of 70.
Conclusions
Although multiple areas of improvement were identified, most of the participants showed an affinity for the overarching objective of the PRIMS. This feedback is being used to upgrade the current PRIMS so that it aligns more with patients’ needs.

Abstract: The identification of multiple genes linked to Parkinson's disease (PD) invites the question as to how they may co-operate. We have generated isogenic cell lines that inducibly express either wild-type or a mutant form of the retromer component VPS35 (D620N), which has been linked to PD. This has enabled us to test proposed effects of this mutation in a setting where the relative expression reflects the physiological occurrence. We confirm that this mutation compromises VPS35 association with the WASH complex, but find no defect in WASH recruitment to endosomes, nor in the distribution of lysosomal receptors, cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor and Sortilin. We show VPS35 (D620N) enhances the activity of the Parkinson’s associated kinase LRRK2 towards RAB12 under basal conditions. Furthermore, VPS35 (D620N) amplifies the LRRK2 response to endolysosomal stress resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of RABs 10 and 12. By comparing different types of endolysosomal stresses such as the ionophore nigericin and the membranolytic agent l-leucyl-l-leucine methyl ester, we are able to dissociate phospho-RAB accumulation from membrane rupture.

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating and serious motor system complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) that may expose patients to frequent falls and life-threating injuries. Several artificial and machine learning methods have been proposed for the prediction of FoG based upon a limited time-duration of sensory data, However, most of the related work has been insufficiently trained and tested on smaller datasets compromising the generalizability of the models. Further, the proposed models provided a prediction at a lower rate (e.g., every 7.8 s). In response to the above shortcomings, we propose a novel variational mode decomposition (VMD) based deep learning that is capable of efficiently inferring the occurrence of FoG at a higher time-resolution (i.e., every sampling period of 7.8 ms) and with a subject-independent accuracy up to 98.8 % outperforming the state-of-the-art architectures and the standard LSTM models. The proposed model will enable the prompt detection of FoG episodes and support PD sufferers reducing the likelihood of falls.

Abstract: There is a molecular coupling between neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucomatous neurodegeneration (GN), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Many cells in the eye and the brain have the right amount of 14–3–3 proteins (14–3–3 s) and their isoforms, such as β, ε, γ, η, θ, π, and γ. These cells include keratocytes, endothelial cells, corneal epithelial cells, and primary conjunctival epithelial cells. 14–3–3 s regulate autophagy and mitophagy, help break down built-up proteins, and connect to other proteins to safeguard against neurodegeneration in AD, PD, GN, and glioblastoma. By interacting with these proteins, 14–3–3 s stop Bad and Bax proteins from entering mitochondria and make them less effective. These interactions inhibit neuronal apoptosis. They play many important roles in managing the breakdown of lysosomal proteins, tau, and Aβ, which is why the 14–3–3 s could be used as therapeutic targets in AD. Furthermore, researchers have discovered 14–3–3 s in Lewy bodies, which are associated with various proteins like LRRK2, ASN, and Parkin, all of which play a role in developing Parkinson's disease (PD). The 14–3–3 s influence the premature aging and natural wrinkles of human skin. Studies have shown that lowering 14–3–3 s in the brain can lead to an increase in cell-death proteins like BAX and ERK, which in turn causes excitotoxicity-induced neurodegeneration. This review aimed to clarify the role of 14–3–3 s in the neuropathology of AD, PD, and GN, as well as potential diagnostic markers for improving neuronal survival and repair.

Abstract: Background
With the increasing availability of data, computing resources, and easier-to-use software libraries, machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in disease detection and prediction, including for Parkinson disease (PD). Despite the large number of studies published every year, very few ML systems have been adopted for real-world use. In particular, a lack of external validity may result in poor performance of these systems in clinical practice. Additional methodological issues in ML design and reporting can also hinder clinical adoption, even for applications that would benefit from such data-driven systems.
Objective
To sample the current ML practices in PD applications, we conducted a systematic review of studies published in 2020 and 2021 that used ML models to diagnose PD or track PD progression.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature review in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines in PubMed between January 2020 and April 2021, using the following exact string: “Parkinson’s” AND (“ML” OR “prediction” OR “classification” OR “detection” or “artificial intelligence” OR “AI”). The search resulted in 1085 publications. After a search query and review, we found 113 publications that used ML for the classification or regression-based prediction of PD or PD-related symptoms.
Results
Only 65.5% (74/113) of studies used a holdout test set to avoid potentially inflated accuracies, and approximately half (25/46, 54%) of the studies without a holdout test set did not state this as a potential concern. Surprisingly, 38.9% (44/113) of studies did not report on how or if models were tuned, and an additional 27.4% (31/113) used ad hoc model tuning, which is generally frowned upon in ML model optimization. Only 15% (17/113) of studies performed direct comparisons of results with other models, severely limiting the interpretation of results.
Conclusions
This review highlights the notable limitations of current ML systems and techniques that may contribute to a gap between reported performance in research and the real-life applicability of ML models aiming to detect and predict diseases such as PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by the selective loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, is a common neurodegenerative disorder for which effective disease-modifying therapies remain unavailable. Rapamycin, a clinical immunosuppressant used for decades, has demonstrated neuroprotective effects in various animal models of neurological diseases, including PD. These effects are believed to be mediated through the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, with rapamycin binding to FKBP12. However, recent studies have suggested that mTOR activation can be neuroprotective in degenerating dopaminergic neurons, presenting a paradox to the neuroprotective mechanism of rapamycin via mTORC1 inhibition. In this study, we showed that mTORC1 signaling was inactivated in nigral dopaminergic neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Notably, the optimal neuroprotective dose of rapamycin did not inhibit mTORC1 signaling nor restore autophagy defects in nigral dopaminergic neurons of MPTP-treated male C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, acute Raptor knockout in dopaminergic neurons, which abolishes mTORC1 activity, did not diminish rapamycin's neuroprotective effects, suggesting that its protection is independent of mTORC1 inhibition. Importantly, rapamycin is also a potent inhibitor of FKBP12, a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase highly expressed in the brain. Selective knockdown of FKBP12 in nigral dopaminergic neurons confers neuroprotective effects comparable to that of rapamycin, with no synergism observed when the two are combined. Collectively, our results indicate that rapamycin exerts neuroprotective effects in parkinsonian mice through inhibition of FKBP12 rather than mTORC1 signaling. These findings suggest that FKBP12 may serve as a novel target for disease-modifying therapies in PD.

Abstract: Objectives
To describe how patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and care partners choose to share or withhold information from clinicians.
Methods
This is a qualitative, descriptive study nested within a multisite, randomized clinical trial of outpatient palliative care compared to standard neurologic care for PD. Interviews with patients (n = 30) and care partners (n = 30) explored experiences communicating with neurology clinicians. Thematic analyses identified themes relevant to patient-care partner-clinician communication.
Results
There were four themes relevant to sharing and/or withholding information from clinicians: (1) Suppressing Concerns During Visits, (2) Care Partner Awareness of Patients’ Communication Barriers due to Cognitive Impairment, (3) Limited Sharing of Sensitive or Intimate Issues by Patients and Care Partners, and (4) Patient and Care Partner Suggestions to Overcome ‘Holding Back’.
Conclusion
Limitations to communication between patients, care partners, and clinicians should be acknowledged and recognized in routine Parkinson’s disease care to foster accurate disclosure of unmet palliative care and other needs. Triadic communication strategies may help patients and care partners talk about unmet palliative care needs.
Innovation
By recognizing that cognitive impairment and sensitive topics can be barriers, clinicians can adjust or adopt targeted communication strategies for identifying and discussing care needs.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by motor dysfunction due to gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system. Currently, medications such as levodopa preparations, offer only temporary symptomatic relief without preventing neuronal loss or halting disease progression. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a particular type of wolfberry or goji berry, the fruit of Lycium barbarum L., has been historically regarded for its neuroprotective properties, potentially offering therapeutic benefits for PD. However, scientific validation of these effects remains limited.
Purpose
This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects of wolfberry glycopeptide (WGP) on PD progression in various animal models, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for its therapeutic action.
Study design
Diverse canonical animal models, including 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats, and α-synuclein overexpressed hSNCAA53T mice, were used to evaluate WGP's anti-PD efficacy. Behavioral deficits and pathological damage to dopaminergic neurons were assessed to determine WGP's neuroprotective potential.
Methods
After establishing the animal models and administering WGP treatment, PD-like behaviors were assessed using pole test, rotarod test and gait analysis. Dopaminergic neurons loss in the midbrain and striatum was detected by means of immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Inflammatory markers in these brain regions were measured by ELISA.
Results
WGP treatment significantly alleviated motor deficits as well as progressive dopaminergic neurons loss. Mechanistically, WGP exerted its neuroprotective effects by regulating iron homeostasis, specifically through the modulation of key proteins such as TFRC, FTH1, and FPN. This function contributed to reducing the accumulation of lipid peroxidation in nigrostriatal system, thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration.
Conclusion
Our findings underscore the innovative potential of WGP as a neuroprotective agent in PD, with a unique mechanism of action targeting iron homeostasis and lipid peroxidation-driven neurodegeneration. This study advances the understanding of TCM's therapeutic contributions to neurodegeneration and positions WGP as a strong candidate for further clinical development in PD treatment.

Abstract: Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the most common gene responsible for familial Parkinson's disease (PD). The gene product of LRRK2 contains multiple protein domains, including armadillo repeat, ankyrin repeat, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), Ras-of-complex (ROC), C-terminal of ROC (COR), kinase, and WD40 domains. In this study, we performed genetic screening of LRRK2 in our PD cohort, detecting sixteen LRRK2 rare variants. Among them, we selected seven variants that are likely to be familial and characterized them in terms of LRRK2 protein function, along with clinical information and one pathological analysis. The seven variants were S1120P and N1221K in the LRR domain; I1339M, S1403R, and V1447M in the ROC domain; and I1658F and D1873H in the COR domain. The kinase activity of the LRRK2 variants N1221K, S1403R, V1447M, and I1658F toward Rab10, a well-known phosphorylation substrate, was higher than that of wild-type LRRK2. LRRK2 D1873H showed enhanced self-association activity, whereas LRRK2 S1403R and D1873H showed reduced microtubule-binding activity. Pathological analysis of a patient with the LRRK2 V1447M variant was also performed, which revealed Lewy pathology in the brainstem. No functional alterations in terms of kinase activity, self-association activity, and microtubule-binding activity were detected in LRRK2 S1120P and I1339M variants. However, the patient with PD carrying LRRK2 S1120P variant also had a heterozygous Glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) L444P variant. In conclusion, we characterized seven LRRK2 variants potentially associated with PD. Five of the seven variants in different LRRK2 domains exhibited altered properties in kinase activity, self-association, and microtubule-binding activity, suggesting that each domain variant may contribute to disease progression in different ways.

Abstract: Introduction
Evaluation of bradykinesia is based on five motor tasks from the MDS-UPDRS. Visually scoring these motor tasks is subjective, resulting in significant interrater variability. Recent observations suggest that it may be easier to hear the characteristic features of bradykinesia, such as the decrement in sound intensity or force of repetitive movements. The objective is to evaluate whether audio signals derived during four MDS-UPDRS tasks can be used to detect and grade bradykinesia, using two machine learning models.
Methods
54 patients with Parkinson's disease and 28 healthy controls were filmed while executing the bradykinesia motor tasks. Several features were extracted from the audio signal, including number of taps, speed, sound intensity, decrement and freezes. For each motor task, two supervised machine learning models were trained, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Results
Both classifiers were able to separate patients from controls reasonably well for the leg agility task, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.92 (95%CI: 0.78–0.99) for LR and 0.93 (0.81–1.00) for SVM. Also, models were able to differentiate less severe bradykinesia from severe bradykinesia, particularly for the pronation-supination motor task, with AUC: 0.90 (0.62–1.00) for LR and 0.82 (0.45–0.97) for SVM.
Conclusion
This audio-based approach discriminates PD from healthy controls with moderate-high accuracy and separated individuals with less severe bradykinesia from those with severe bradykinesia. Sound analysis may contribute to the identification and monitoring of bradykinesia.

Abstract: Background
Dual-task (DT) performance is impaired in Parkinson’s disease (PD), contributing to bradykinesia, postural instability, freezing of gait, and falls. Tactile cueing, including vibrotactile stimulation, has been suggested to improve DT performance in PD.
Research Question
Does tactile cueing affect DT performance in PD, specifically measured by dual-task cost (DTC)?
Methods
A systematic review was conducted in PubMed and EMBASE up to October 30, 2023, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies were those in English that examined the effects of tactile cueing and/or closed-loop vibrotactile stimulation on DT performance in adults over 18 with idiopathic PD. The primary outcome, DTC, was calculated as the percentage change in performance from DT to single-task using the formula: [(single-task − dual-task)/single-task]* 100. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) of DTC. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
From 130 initially identified studies, eight were included in the review. Four studies with 374 participants were included in meta-analyses focusing on walking speed and step length. Three of the four studies indicated that tactile cueing improved DTC for these parameters. However, the SMD for walking speed (−109.69; 95 % CI −454.89 to 235.51, p = 0.39) and step length (−14.21; 95 %CI −53.25 to 24.83, p = 0.33) showed weak evidence of improvement.
Conclusion
The meta-analysis provides weak evidence that tactile cueing may enhance walking speed and step length in DT conditions in PD. Rigorous objective studies are still lacking in this field of research.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Parkinson’s disease has both familial and sporadic cases of origin governed differentially by genetic and/or environmental factors. Different epidemiological studies have proposed an association between the pathogenesis of cancer and Parkinson’s disease; however, a precise correlation between these two illnesses could not be established yet. In this study, we examined the disease-modifying property of dmyc (a Drosophila homolog of human cmyc proto-oncogene) in the paraquat-induced sporadic Parkinson’s disease model of Drosophila. We report for the first time that targeted upregulation of dMyc significantly restricts paraquat-mediated neurotoxicity. We observed that paraquat feeding reduces the cellular level of dMyc. We further noted that targeted upregulation of dMyc in paraquat-exposed flies mitigates degeneration of dopaminergic neurons by reinstating the aberrantly activated JNK pathway, and this in turn improves the motor performance and survival rate of the flies. Our study provides the first evidence that improved cellular level of dMyc could efficiently minimize the neurotoxic effects of paraquat, which could be beneficial in designing novel therapeutic strategies against Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. The main neuropathological features of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra striata and the extensive accumulation of α-synuclein in different brain regions. The substantia nigra and striatum are brain regions with high expression of cannabinoid receptors, and the role of the endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) has been explored in PD. The ECS may be a promising target for the treatment of PD. The correlation between PD and serum uric acid levels has been demonstrated in a large number of studies, but a causal relationship between the two has not been proven. Xanthine and hypoxanthine are upstream metabolite of uric acid, and they have been shown to be effective in relieving PD symptoms. Therefore, we hypothesized that xanthine or hypoxanthine or both may increase the inhibitory properties of GABAergic neurons by increasing the sensitivity of cannabinoid receptors on GABAergic neurons in the striatum, thereby activating the direct nigrostriatal pathway to ameliorate Parkinson's disease symptoms. The proposed hypothesis can be tested in animal and cellular intervention experiments. If this approach is found to be effective in improving PD symptoms with minimal adverse events, exogenous supplementation of xanthine/ hypoxanthine or the use of xanthine oxidase to block its metabolism to elevate hypoxanthine levels could potentially be an effective addition to PD therapy.

Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, trailing only Alzheimer´s disease. It currently affects nearly 3 % of individuals aged 65 and above. The disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons accompanied by a chronic neuroinflammatory process, which is responsible for both motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor symptoms (depression, dysphagia, anxiety, constipation, and anosmia). To gain a deeper comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms underlying PD and to facilitate the development of efficacious therapeutic interventions, it is imperative to utilize animal models that accurately reflect the pathological characteristics observed in humans. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies employed in the generation of animal models of Parkinson’s disease in laboratory settings. These models, which encompass a range of approaches, serve as invaluable tools for reproducing key aspects of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation associated with PD. By establishing reliable animal models, we can investigate the cellular and molecular pathways driving disease progression, thereby gaining insights into potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, the chapter discusses the limitations and advantages of different model systems, emphasizing their relevance in translational research aimed at finding effective treatments for PD patients.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide, which worsens with advancing age. It is a common movement disorder and is often associated with several vascular diseases with decreased stroke frequency. Circulating platelets substantially regulate vascular complications, including stroke, and share striking similarities with PD neurons. Although structural alterations in platelets are well-documented in PD, their functional parameters remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the functional abnormalities in platelets associated with PD by evaluating key functional aspects such as adhesion, activation, secretion, aggregation, and clot retraction. To achieve this, we treated human blood platelets with 6-hydroxydopamine or 6-OHDA, that selectively destroys dopaminergic neurons, thereby creating an in vitro experimental model that closely resembles the pathogenic environment in PD, and examine its impact on platelet functions. In our study, platelet adhesion was assessed and further evaluated by a microplate reader, activation and secretion by a flow cytometer, aggregation by aggregometer, and clot retraction by Sonoclot. Phase-contrast and confocal microscopic studies further verified the results from the above experiments. Our findings showed that 6-OHDA treatment significantly inhibited thrombin (a platelet agonist)-induced functions, including adhesion, activation, aggregation, secretion, and clot retraction in human-washed platelets. In summary, this research provides pioneering evidence that 6-OHDA induces abnormal platelet functions, shedding light on the previously unexplored processes by which 6-OHDA affects platelet activity.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra and loss of DA transmission in the striatum, thus making cell transplantation an effective treatment strategy. Here, we develop a cellular therapy based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain organoids. By transplanting midbrain organoid cells into the striatum region of a 6-OHDA-lesioned PD mouse model, we found that the transplanted cells survived and highly efficiently differentiated into DA neurons. Further, using a dopamine sensor, we observed that the differentiated human DA neurons could efficiently release dopamine and were integrated into the neural network of the PD mice. Moreover, starting from four weeks after transplantation, the motor function of the transplanted mice could be significantly improved. Therefore, cell therapy based on iPSC-derived midbrain organoids can be a potential strategy for the clinical treatment of PD.
