Deep learning algorithms have been effectively utilized in recent years for several medical imaging applications, including the identification of Alzheimer’s disease. In this paper, we propose a modification of VGG-16 architecture, AttentionVGG-16, that outperforms current state-of-the-art results on both the ADNI and OASIS datasets. We have done an ablation study to understand the impact of adding attention layers to VGG-16 and zero-shot learning strategy to understand the model’s generalization capability.

Thus, early detection of such disease is highly required. Using MRI images, a number of deep models have been created to predict AD as artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced. However, these models suffer from limited representation in extracting fine-grained features from MRI images thereby performance is declined. The proposed model overcomes such limitation and presents a methodology for AD detection by proposing a novel multi-layer feature fusion-based deep multi-layer depth-wise separable convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed model enhances the quality of features by fusing multi-layer features. These features range from representations of low-level features to features at the object level. The fused multiscale features are used for predicting AD disease. Publicly available dataset is used to validate the model's performance. With an accuracy of 95.16 percent, the suggested model performs better than the current state of the art.","","979-8-3503-0282-0","10.1109/ICICAT57735.2023.10263657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10263657","medical image analysis;Alzheimer's disease;deep learning","Neurological diseases;Convolution;Magnetic resonance imaging;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Alzheimer's disease;Artificial intelligence","","10","","23","IEEE","2 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Out of the 1713 male and female subjects, 768 female subjects were studied to investigate the prevalence of AD and MCI, those diagnosed with AD and MCI and their associated risk factors. The study data were gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Twenty potential clinical features were included; comprised of a combination of demographic, cerebral spinal fluid, cognitive, diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalography, genetic, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography testing variables. The regression analysis metrics R-squared, F-statistic, Omnibus, Durbin-Watson, Coefficient and Standard error, were used to evaluate the model. Our results showed that cognitive assessment metrics were highly significant among the other testing biomarkers. Additionally, we determined the significance of each clinical variable.

Integrating multimodal neuroimaging datasets can enhance the early detection of AD. However, models must address the challenge of incomplete modalities, a common issue in real-world scenarios, as not all patients have access to all modalities due to practical constraints such as cost and availability. We propose a deep learning framework employing Incomplete Cross-modal Mutual Knowledge Distillation (IC-MKD) to model different sub-cohorts of patients based on their available modalities. In IC-MKD, the multimodal model (e.g., MRI and PET) serves as a teacher, while the single-modality model (e.g., MRI only) is the student. Our IC-MKD framework features three components: a Modality-Disentangling Teacher (MDT) model designed through information disentanglement, a student model that learns from classification errors and MDT’s knowledge, and the teacher model enhanced via distilling the student’s single-modal feature extraction capabilities. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method through theoretical analysis and validate its performance with simulation studies. In addition, our method is demonstrated through a case study with Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets, underscoring the potential of artificial intelligence in addressing incomplete multimodal neuroimaging datasets and advancing early AD detection. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the challenge of early AD diagnosis, particularly in scenarios when clinicians encounter varied availability of patient imaging data, such as MRI and PET scans, often constrained by cost or accessibility issues. We propose an incomplete multimodal learning framework that produces tailored models for patients with only MRI and patients with both MRI and PET. This approach improves the accuracy and effectiveness of early AD diagnosis, especially when imaging resources are limited, via bi-directional knowledge transfer. We introduced a teacher model that prioritizes extracting common information between different modalities, significantly enhancing the student model’s learning process. This paper includes theoretical analysis, simulation study, and real-world case study to illustrate the method’s promising potential in early AD detection. However, practitioners should be mindful of the complexities involved in model tuning. Future work will focus on improving model interpretability and expanding its application. This includes developing methods to discover the key brain regions for predictions, enhancing clinical trust, and extending the framework to incorporate a broader range of imaging modalities, demographic information, and clinical data. These advancements aim to provide a more comprehensive view of patient health and improve diagnostic accuracy across various neurodegenerative diseases.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3556290","NIH(grant numbers:2R42AG053149-02A1,R01AG069453,P30AG072980); NSF(grant numbers:DMS-2053170); State of Arizona; Banner Alzheimer’s Foundation; Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) through the National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:DMS-2053170); Department of Defense (DOD) ADNI(grant numbers:W81XWH-12-2-0012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10945821","Alzheimer’s disease;incomplete multimodal datasets;knowledge distillation;mild cognitive impairment;representation disentanglement","Magnetic resonance imaging;Neuroimaging;Feature extraction;Modeling;Imaging;Alzheimer's disease;Accuracy;Artificial intelligence;Adaptation models;Predictive models","","4","","64","IEEE","31 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existence of AD is primarily a complicated biological and neurodegenerative illness, and various computer modeling techniques to overcome the complexity of the disease are needed. Moreover, the study of brain disorders, large-scale brain models, or connectomes, depends heavily on high-performance computing (HPC). This systematic review intends to answer five key questions about the function of the HPC in the early diagnosis of the AD, as the best contender for dealing with the high-dimensional problems. This review also intends to review the previous articles on the HPC for the early diagnosis of the AD and the computational performance solutions in the literature, which could be used for increasing the diagnostic speed and the research output. The previous articles on the topic are found using the following search codes: ALL = (“parallel processing” AND “Alzheimer’s disease” OR “high performance computing” AND “Alzheimer’s disease” OR “parallel computing” AND “Alzheimer’s disease” OR “parallel processing” AND “Alzheimer” OR “high performance computing” AND “Alzheimer” OR “parallel computing” AND “Alzheimer”) between the years 2014 and 2023.

According to the findings of the classifications, AD is the most frequent cause of dementia globally, and there is currently no specific therapy that slows its course. However, the HPC could provide some rapid computations of various modeling methodologies, allowing each aspect of the brain to be seen. Some institutes are attempting to simulate prospective remedies for the disease. Various approaches are integrated to be utilized in the literature with the help of the HPC in this review, and to enlighten readers about the current status of the HPC technologies for the early detection and treatment of the AD across the world.

The data utilized in the study was obtained from Tongji Hospital in Shanghai, China, including 65 NCs, 58 MCIs and 36 ADs. First, we calculated the ALPS-index to evaluate the activity of the glymphatic system. Then, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to find the differences of ALPS-index among different groups, and to explore the correlation between ALPS-index and the three clinical scales: Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B) and Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the role of the ALPS-index in disease classification. The findings indicated a significant difference in the ALPS-index between the groups of participants with normal cognition, MCI, and AD. In addition, we found that ALPS-index was significantly correlated with the scores of the three clinical scales (with MoCA-B: r=0.233, p=0.001). Furthermore, with ALPS-index, Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values achieved best classification results (AUC=0.8899).

In this research, we propose a novel prediction framework harnessing deep learning methodologies, specifically employing the advanced EfficientNetB6 algorithm, on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset comprising approximately 20,000 MRI images. Our aim is to differentiate between MRI images indicating normal cognitive function and those signaling AD progression, with a target of achieving 97.78% accuracy and a 98.21% F1 score. Moreover, our model categorizes images into various stages, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), facilitating early identification. The proposed model's high accuracy and precision hold the potential to transform early detection efforts, allowing for timely interventions and thereby improving patients' quality of life. In addition to leveraging the EfficientNetB6 model for image feature extraction and LSTM networks for sequential data analysis, the proposed hybrid architecture incorporates dense layers to facilitate feature fusion and abstraction. The dense layers enable the model to combine the extracted image and sequential features, capturing complex relationships between different modalities and enhancing the model's discriminative power. By integrating dense layers, the model gains the flexibility to learn higher-level representations, further refining the extracted features for improved classification performance.

Here we investigated the changes of local cerebral blood microcirculation in preclinical AD mouse model after AtDCS based on the previous studies. Twenty-four 6-month-old male APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided into three groups: a model group (AD), a model sham stimulation (ADST) group and a model stimulation group (ATD).

"AI-Driven Analysis of Biomarkers Using Machine Learning for Alzheimer's Research in Drosophila Melanogaster","E.

However, traditional research methods for exploring treatments and behavioral indicators of Alzheimer's in Drosophila have mainly relied on manual techniques. Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology provides significant advantages in reliably analyzing biological behavior and processes. This paper develops a novel AI-driven analysis method using automatic video monitoring to investigate behavioral biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's in Drosophila and to implement machine learning models for predicting the presence of Alzheimer's. Five experimental groups of Drosophila-healthy, Alzheimer's, and Alzheimer's treated with 2 g, 4 g, and 6 g of Aloe vera-were used for AI analysis. Drosophila movement and behavior were tracked to analyze four biomarkers-negative geotaxis, velocity, directional heading changes, and grooming magnitude. Five behavioral parameters as features for machine learning were identified: speed, x-distance, y-distance, acceleration, and turning angle. Three machine learning models were developed to predict whether a Drosophila has Alzheimer's: two classical models (CatBoost and XGBoost) and a deep learning model (CNN-GRU). The three models achieved accuracies of 0.8654, 0.8638, and 0.8454 respectively. In addition, the AI-driven method was used to evaluate the effect of Aloe vera as a natural treatment for Alzheimer's model of Drosophila. Results indicated that Aloe as a natural treatment improved mobility and stability in the Alzheimer's model of Drosophila. The proposed AI-driven system for uncovering behavioral biomarkers in Drosophila with Alzheimer's offers a reliable and more effective alternative to traditional manual methods. Evaluating the potential of Aloe vera to be a therapeutic agent opens new doors to discovering new natural treatments for neurodegenerative disorders.","","979-8-3315-0913-2","10.1109/ICMI65310.2025.11141267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11141267","Machine learning;Alzheimer's Disease;Behavioral Biomarkers;Drosophila melanogaster;AI;Natural Antioxidant;Aloe vera","Antioxidants;Accuracy;Biological system modeling;Machine learning;Manuals;Biomarkers;Predictive models;Reliability;Alzheimer's disease;Videos","","","","17","IEEE","8 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are now considered effective in mitigating this late detection issue. This is more popular due to its non-invasiveness and instantaneous work function. However, it also has some adversities due to its lack of cost-effectiveness since many electrode channels are used to detect the dysfunctions from the different lobes of the brain, making it look more complex. So, in this study, we have aimed to enhance EEG-based diagnostics for Alzheimer's through comprehensive feature extraction incorporating machine learning as well as electrode channel reduction analysis. Three major brain regions: frontal, parietal, and temporal, have been considered for effective AD detection. 14 electrodes from these brain regions are analyzed for significant feature extraction. Then, we figured out the necessary statistical and frequency features from each EEG segment. The features went through different tests to check the most important features. Different combinations of features were applied for various machine learning algorithms, and the highest accuracy of 88.5% was achieved in the parietal region using 26 features. In the future, the parietal region can be further analyzed with more features and deep learning methods which will help in medical diagnosis and treatment.","","979-8-3315-5542-9","10.1109/NCIM65934.2025.11160237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11160237","Alzheimer’s disease (AD);Brain region;Electroencephalography (EEG);Machine learning (ML)","Electrodes;Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Medical diagnosis;Alzheimer's disease;Next generation networking","","","","16","IEEE","17 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the recent progress in medical image analysis using deep learning especially has automated this task significantly. Although the state-of-the-art architectures have achieved human-level performance in classifying AD images from Normal Control (NC), they often require predefined Regions of interest as a basis for feature extraction.

But due to the high variance of the data, the classification performance of SVM remains unsatisfactory, especially for delineating the MCI group from the cognitively normal control (CN) group. This study introduces a novel algorithm based on the Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA) for a more effective and accurate classification performance. Subjects considered in this study included 190 CN, 305 MCI, and 133 AD subjects. Using 75% of the data as the training set with a tenfold cross validation, the proposed algorithm achieved an average accuracy of 94.17%, a sensitivity of 93.00%, and a specificity of 95.00% for discriminating AD from CN; and an average accuracy of 84.86%, a sensitivity of 84.78%, and a specificity of 85.00% for discriminating MCI from CN. Then a true test was implemented for the remaining 25% data, for discriminating specifically MCI from CN, resulting in an accuracy of 82.20%, a sensitivity of 83.10%, and a specificity of 80.85%. As revealed through the literature, these results involving the delineation of the MCI group from CN could be considered as the best classification performance obtained so far.

This neurological disorder causes neurodegenerative alterations in the brain to unfold gradually, commencing with mild memory impairment and then escalating to loss of social interaction and awareness of the environment. Alzheimer Disease International (ADI) believes that 75% of dementia cases globally go undetected, making the early diagnosis challenging. Currently, stopping the development of Alzheimer’s disease is difficult since there are no viable diagnosis and treatment solutions available. To overcome these challenges, there is now great interest in using machine learning (ML) for early diagnosis of metabolic disorders such as Alzheimer’s. In this work, we propose utilizing a deep convolutional neural network to detect the different phases of Alzheimer’s disease using brain MRI structural data analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and achieves greater efficacy for initial-stage detection. Clinicians can use the suggested categorization approach to diagnose these disorders much earlier. With these ML algorithms, it is highly advantageous to reduce yearly death rates of Alzheimer’s disease in early diagnosis. The suggested technique achieves improved results, with an approved mean score of 96.1% on Alzheimer’s Disease test data. Compared to previous efforts, the current score for accuracy is much greater.","","979-8-3503-4891-0","10.1109/ICDSAAI59313.2023.10452539","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10452539","Alzheimer’s disease;dementia;early detection;deep convolutional neural network","Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Generative adversarial networks;Brain modeling;Convolutional neural networks;Reliability;Alzheimer's disease;Diseases;Python","","4","","20","IEEE","4 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Handwriting analysis has shown potential as a low-cost, non-invasive method for early AD identification. These data were used to train various ML classifiers to classify individuals as either AD or non-AD. Baseline evaluations were conducted using multiple classifiers on the entire feature set and on individual tasks. The insights gained from these evaluations were then utilized to create a more optimized model combining the strength of multiple classifiers with the help of the TOPSIS method. The optimized model achieved a promising accuracy of 97% on the test set, demonstrating its potential for early AD detection. Our findings suggest that handwriting analysis, coupled with ML techniques, holds significant promise as a tool for early AD prediction and warrants further investigation.","","979-8-3503-8459-8","10.1109/AIC61668.2024.10730986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10730986","Alzheimer’s Disease;Handwriting Analysis","Accuracy;Target recognition;Filtering;Machine learning;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Reliability;Iterative methods;Alzheimer's disease;Standards","","","","11","IEEE","29 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we designed a novel diagnostic framework with deep learning architecture to aid the diagnosis of AD.

Utilizing machine learning and image processing techniques, recent advancements in medical imaging and image analysis have made it feasible to produce and extract valuable neuroimaging data for the precise diagnosis of the illness. Classifiers have been used to separate AD patients from healthy persons and to forecast when moderate cognitive impairment may turn into AD. In order to accurately predict the severity of AD in patients and lessen the disease's harmful effects later on by receiving the necessary medical attention, this study proposes a multimodal deep learning classification technique for the prediction of AD.

ICA exploits higher-order statistics to identify gene expression profiles as linear combinations of elementary expression patterns that may be interpreted as potential regulation pathways. This method can identify many genes and related pathways that play a prominent role in AD and relate the activation patterns of these to AD phenotypes. Using the extracted significant genes, the classification of AD and control samples gets more easy and effective by less gene data.

The most worrying problems facing the world are the significant rise in the prevalence of dementia, especially for those over the age of 65, with no treatment for this disease. Consequently, healthcare costs have increased steadily, which puts a burden on healthcare systems and puts pressure on families. Researchers have estimated that by 2050, there would be 152 million individuals worldwide living with dementia. The cost of dementia care is expected to exceed $1 trillion. Therefore, it is important for these patients to try to do what they can do for themselves, such as going out without a company and taking medicine on time for as long as possible. The aim of this study is to assist Alzheimer's disease patients to slow cognitive degradation and reduce the burden of care and psychological pressure on families and caregivers.

In such a scenario, it becomes imperative to diagnose and stage Alzheimer's accurately with a view to managing and probably slowing down the progression of the disease. While no cure has been found, early diagnosis by brain imaging with reasonably good accuracy-like through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)- plays a very essential role in patient management. MRI can point out brain abnormalities linked to different stages of cognitive impairment, such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. This paper presents a new technique for classifying the stages of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images using the ResNet152V2 architecture, which is very prominent in deep residual learning in a convolutional neural network. The deployed algorithm categorized the MRI images into four different categories: “Mild Demented,” “Moderate Demented,” “Non-Demented,” and “Very Mild Demented.” Model evaluation is done through precision, recall, F1-scores, and accuracy metrics. Results show very high accuracy and robustness in the classification of different stages of dementia, with an overall accuracy of 97.31 % and strong performance for all metrics of classification. Deep learning techniques may more likely add great value to the improvement of diagnostic accuracy and the establishment of a clinical decision-making workflow in Alzheimer's disease management.","","979-8-3503-6910-6","10.1109/DASA63652.2024.10836437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10836437","MRI classification;Convolutional Neural Networks;Alzheimer's disease;CNN;automated diagnosis;dementia stages;image classification;Deep Learning (DL);medical imaging","Performance evaluation;Neuroimaging;Deep learning;Accuracy;Magnetic resonance imaging;Decision making;Robustness;Data models;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease","","1","","16","IEEE","17 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several studies have been conducted to detect this disease; however, most of these techniques perform a binary classification to distinguish individuals with AD from healthy ones. Even when such techniques are highly accurate in detecting the disease, they serve merely as a partial AD diagnostic tool since no information regarding its stage is identified. To address this issue, we propose a deep feed-forward neural network based on multi-task learning capable of simultaneously detecting AD and identifying its progression stage. Relying on multiple loss functions simultaneously, this model recognizes four classes of individuals: healthy, with early mild cognitive impairment, with late mild cognitive impairment, and with AD.

In this study, we included 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) scans from Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing, China. 85 SCD subjects and 74 NC subjects were included. First, we calculated and compared network parameters between the two groups. We then identified the bilateral insula and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus as seed sites and studied the connections to the whole brain. The results showed that both the SCD and the NC showed small-world nature, but the metabolic network of SCD tended to be more regular. The clustering coefficient and local efficiency of SCD were significantly higher than those of NC (P<0.05). In addition, we found that carrying APOE resulted in enhanced metabolic connectivity, but with weaker aggregation and local information exchangeability.

It causes memory loss and affects the cognitive function, which makes it difficult for a person with AD to do simple tasks. Detecting AD at an early stage can help in slowing down the progression of the disease by taking appropriate medication. Traditionally AD diagnosis is done using cognitive testing, but these tests are ineffective for testing at early stages of AD. Advancements in technology has allowed for early detection of AD, with the help of artificial intelligence. Machine learning (ML) models are developed and trained which are used for classifying the severity of AD. In this paper magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain is used as dataset.

The brain shrinks and loses brain cells as a result of Alzheimer's disease. While the condition can strike at any age, most patients with Alzheimer's disease are over 65.. Alzheimer patients mostly have Symptoms like memory loss, disorientation and problems with thinking ability but vary from person to person. Although genetics, environment, and lifestyle are the most likely causes of this illness, other experts think there may be multiple causes. The term “dementia” refers to brain illnesses that impair thinking, memory, and behaviour. The most typical cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease typically struggle to speak clearly, identify relatives and friends, and recognise items. They can also become angry, restless, and frustrated. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, physical issues like weakness, loss of balance, and impaired bladder and bowel control appear. In this study paper, we will introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a machine learning technique, to recognise Alzheimer's disease. On the input image, image segmentation is carried out. CNN is a group of artificial neural networks that provides a more scalable approach to image classification and identification of patterns in images. Convolution is a mathematical procedure that CNN employs in place of matrix multiplication at one layer. CNN are different from other neural networks by their exceptional performance with audio, image or speech signal inputs. CNN algorithm take an input image, assign priority to different aspects for an image to find difference between images.

Although previous works have validated the effectiveness of incorporating metadata (e.g., age, gender, and educational years) for sMRI-based AD diagnosis, existing methods solely paid attention to metadata-associated correlation to AD (e.g., gender bias in AD prevalence) or confounding effects (e.g., the issue of normal aging and metadata-related heterogeneity). Hence, it is difficult to fully excavate the influence of metadata on AD diagnosis. To address these issues, we constructed a novel Multi-template Meta-information Regularized Network (MMRN) for AD diagnosis. Specifically, considering diagnostic variation resulting from different spatial transformations onto different brain templates, we first regarded different transformations as data augmentation for self-supervised learning after template selection. Since the confounding effects may arise from excessive attention to meta-information owing to its correlation with AD, we then designed the modules of weakly supervised meta-information learning and mutual information minimization to learn and disentangle meta-information from learned class-related representations, which accounts for meta-information regularization for disease diagnosis. We have evaluated our proposed MMRN on two public multi-center cohorts, including the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with 1,950 subjects and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) with 1,163 subjects. The experimental results have shown that our proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks of AD diagnosis, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction, and normal control (NC) vs. MCI vs. AD classification.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2023.3344384","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62371219,61771233); Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation(grant numbers:2023A1515011260); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10365189","Alzheimer’s disease;multi-template;meta-information;mutual information","Feature extraction;Metadata;Self-supervised learning;Mutual information;Alzheimer's disease;Aging;Minimization","Alzheimer Disease;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Brain;Aged;Female;Male;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms","5","","59","IEEE","18 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is caused by complex brain changes that occur over time, including the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which disrupt communication between neurons and ultimately lead to cell death. The impact of Alzheimer's extends beyond the individual, profoundly affecting families and caregivers, as it often results in severe cognitive decline and a loss of independence. Current estimates suggest that millions of individuals are living with Alzheimer's, leading to considerable healthcare costs and emotional burdens. Thus, the urgent need for accurate diagnosis, effective treatments, and supportive care systems is critical for improving the quality of life for those affected and advancing our understanding of this complex disease. Hence, the aim of this proposed study is to address a critical issue in Alzheimer's disease detection by implementing the VGG16 algorithm for feature extraction and EfficientNetB0 and Tiny-CNN for classification.

In the paper, an optimized deep learning network (DLN) model is proposed to automatically diagnose AD, MCI, and cognitive normal (CN). Hyperparameters play an important role in DLN's training and performance, so the hyperparameters' selection is the main step while designing the model.

However, to solve any non-linear and complex problem, the low-level and mid-level features are as important as the high-level features. Such an approach is missing in the AD classification. To solve this, we proposed a novel way to utilise low, mid, and high (LMH) features for classification. We design the suggested framework using the backbone of a multilayer atrous CNN. We enhance the LMH features by exploiting features from a multicolumn atrous convolution with varying kernel shapes, which can extract features at multiple scales. We adopt, modify, and apply a spatial attention mechanism over the enhanced LMH features to emphasise important features or attributes in the spatial domain. A multilayer of dense neurons receives the fused and enhanced spatially attentive LMH features for AD classification.

Alarmingly, 75% of Alzheimer's cases go undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness. Machine learning models have shown significant value in the early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. These models enable physicians to start medication at an early stage, which can help delay the onset of symptoms.

To improve AD diagnosis, this study explores a novel approach using electroencephalography (EEG) during the encoding stage of working memory. It focuses on the excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) imbalance and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) as potential markers for AD detection. AD involves tau-mediated neuronal inhibition, impacting brain activity during cognitive tasks. Cognitive decline in AD is linked to pathological changes reflected in the E/I balance. EEG captures brain activity during memory encoding, potentially revealing AD-specific patterns. Previous studies have explored brain activity alterations in AD during encoding, this study goes further by investigating the complexity of electrical activity using DFA and reflecting the neural state utilizing E/I. EEG data is collected from AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control (HC) groups while performing a working memory task. The encoding stage data for each group is analyzed using DFA and E/I measures at different frequency bands. The increased long-range temporal correlation in AD compared to MCI and HC suggests altered temporal dynamics in AD during encoding. The lower E/I values in AD, followed by MCI and HC, indicate reduced neural activity during encoding with increasing AD severity. This preliminary study suggests that the EEG-based E/I measure and DFA analysis during working memory encoding show potential for distinguishing AD, MCI, and HC subjects. This approach provides valuable insights for potential AD prediction and stage discrimination by capturing altered neural activity and complex brain dynamics.","2076-1465","978-9-4645-9361-7","10.23919/EUSIPCO63174.2024.10715308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10715308","EEG;Alzheimer's Disease (AD);encoding;detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA);excitation-inhibition ratio (E/I);Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)","Fluctuations;Atmospheric measurements;Neural activity;Time series analysis;Particle measurements;Encoding;Electroencephalography;Frequency measurement;Complexity theory;Alzheimer's disease","","","","34","","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, we propose an Attention Guided Generative Adversarial Network (AG-GAN) framework for improving MRI-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in this study. The dual-stream attention model is proposed, in which the deep learning process is refined by a dual-stream attention mechanism to extract refined MRI features and enhance its capability of discriminability to labels. The AG-GAN framework provides high-quality synthetic MRI scans that help with data augmentation and mitigate the class imbalance problem in AD datasets. Moreover, the attention module is designed to learn key pathological features using robust feature learning. Finally, we test the model on AD datasets and benchmark it against baseline CNN classifiers and standard GAN-based classifiers. The results of the proposed experiment show improved classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of this approach for early AD detection.

Many algorithms are based on a relatively large training dataset. However, small hospitals are usually unable to collect sufficient training samples for robust classification. Although data sharing is expanding in scientific research, it is unclear whether a model based on one dataset is well suited for other data sources. Using a small dataset from a local hospital and a large shared dataset from the AD neuroimaging initiative, we conducted a heterogeneity analysis and found that different functional magnetic resonance imaging data sources show different sample distributions in feature space. In addition, we proposed an effective knowledge transfer method to diminish the disparity among different datasets and improve the classification accuracy on datasets with insufficient training samples. The accuracy increased by approximately 20% compared with that of a model based only on the original small dataset. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach is a novel and effective method for CAD in hospitals with only small training datasets. It solved the challenge of limited sample size in detection of AD, which is a common issue but lack of adequate attention.

However, sMRI datasets often suffer from domain shifts due to variations in scanning protocols, and real-world clinical scenarios frequently involve unknown categories, presenting challenges for conventional domain adaptation methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) framework that not only detects unknown class but also improves AD diagnosis. The method integrates demographic information as auxiliary features alongside sMRI-derived features to enhance the recognition of high-dimensional data. Features are projected onto a hyperspherical space via a spherical variational auto-encoder (S-VAE), enabling efficient feature representations. Domain alignment is achieved using a von Mises-Fisher kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy function, while A-softmax loss enables the model learn angularly discriminative feature representations. Additionally, an entropy minimization strategy ensures greater prediction confidence in the target domain. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves OS of 92.29%, 85.28%, and 80.37% on AD vs. CN vs. Unk, MCl vs. CN vs. Unk, and AD vs. MCl vs. Unk tasks, respectively. This framework extends the applicability of OSDA techniques to medical imaging, providing enhanced diagnostic accuracy and enabling more robust AD detection.","","979-8-3315-4175-0","10.1109/ICFTIC64248.2024.10913291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10913291","Alzheimer's disease;open set domain adaptation;S-VAE;maximum mean discrepancy;A-softmax loss;entropy minimization","Representation learning;Accuracy;Protocols;Predictive models;Minimization;Feature extraction;Entropy;Reliability;Alzheimer's disease;Biomedical imaging","","","","13","IEEE","13 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are commonly used for diagnosing AD, they often detect the disease at a later stage when brain damage has already occurred, limiting their effectiveness for early detection. In contrast, non-invasive diagnostic methods, particularly those based on speech analysis, have shown potential for identifying AD in its early stages. This review paper examines the role of machine learning techniques in analyzing speech patterns to detect early signs of AD. It provides a comparative analysis of recent studies, focusing on models like Transformers, Wav2Vec, and BERT, and their performance across various datasets such as ADReSSo and DementiaBank Pitt. The review highlights how the integration of advanced pre-processing techniques with deep learning architectures enhances diagnostic accuracy, with certain models achieving notably high performance. These findings emphasize the promise of AI-driven speech analysis as a cost-effective, scalable, and accessible approach for early detection, offering a critical window for timely intervention. While promising, challenges such as dataset diversity, computational efficiency, and clinical integration remain, which could affect the scalability and real-world applicability of these models. Further research is needed to address these limitations, refine the techniques, and explore their potential for improving diagnostic precision across diverse populations. Additionally, future work should focus on the integration of these models into clinical workflows and the exploration of longitudinal data to track AD progression over time, ultimately leading to more personalized and timely interventions.

Early diagnosis of AD has implications for early intervention and management. In this context, the Alzheimer's Disease Dataset was utilized in the current study, comprising 2,149 instances and 35 features to construct predictive models using different Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In order to increase the relevance of features for better performance of the models, the dataset was preprocessed rigorously and retained only the top 12 most correlated attributes. The different machine learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost, and a Voting Classifier were trained and evaluated by various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among the tested models, CatBoost provided the highest accuracy of 96%, outperforming other algorithms. This demonstrates the potential of feature reduction in maintaining the performance of models. The result emphasizes the ability of ML to enhance early detection of Alzheimer's disease and provides the ground for a future improvement of AD diagnostic methodologies.","","979-8-3315-2341-1","10.1109/ICTCS65341.2025.10989449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10989449","Alzheimer's Disease;CatBoost Classifier;Early Diagnosis;Feature Reduction;Machine Learning Models","Neuroimaging;Accuracy;Machine learning;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Encoding;Reliability;Alzheimer's disease;Random forests;Overfitting","","","","19","IEEE","20 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
