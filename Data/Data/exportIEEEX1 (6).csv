Early detection of MCI associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD-MCI) and its biomarkers is critical to managing disability in PD patients, reducing caregiver burden and healthcare costs. Gait is considered a surrogate marker for cognitive decline in PD. However, gait kinematic and kinetic features in PD-MCI patients remain unknown. This study was designed to explore the difference in gait kinematics and kinetics during single-task and dual-task walking between PD patients with and without MCI. Kinematic and kinetic data of 90 PD patients were collected using 3D motion capture system. Differences in gait kinematic and kinetic gait features between groups were identified by using: first, univariate statistical analysis and then a supervised machine learning analysis. The findings of this study showed that the presence of MCI in PD patients is coupled with kinematic and kinetic deviations of gait cycle which may eventually identify two different phenotypes of the disease. Indeed, as shown by the demographical and clinical comparison between the two groups, PD-MCI patients were older and more impaired. Moreover, PD-MCI kinematic results showed that cognitive dysfunction coexists with more severe axial symptoms and an increase postural flexion. A lack of physiological distal-to-proximal shift in joint kinetics was evidenced in the PD phenotype associated with cognitive impairments.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2024.3431234","Fondi di Ateneo per la Ricerca di Base (FARB) 2020; Rehabilitation Department, University Hospital (A.O.U.) “San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d’Aragona,” Salerno, Italy, with the Collaboration of M.

In this work, we report on a second opinion system based on the video analysis and classification of subjects using machine learning methods including feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and classification. Our approach serves for avoiding a typical misdiagnosis of PD by essential tremor. Consequently, we designed 15 common tasks and recorded the movement video. Video data was collected from 89 subjects at a medical center and labeled by doctors. We first demonstrate classification between the healthy subjects and subjects with PD suspected case followed by the classification between the subjects with true PD and the subjects with essential tremor. We achieved f1 score 0.90 for the first classification and f1 score 0.84 for the second classification. The proposed unobtrusive approach demonstrated its feasibility through a pilot study.

More specifically, we adopt the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) Expectation - Maximization (EM) framework. A critical step of our approach is the use of smoothness prior to model the resting state fMRI time - series. Also, it is important to enforce spatial properties in our model due to physical properties of fMRI time series. We provide experimental results using real fMRI benchmarks that show the efficiency of our method.

The disease’s symptoms are characterized by tremors, muscle rigidity, slowness in movements, balancing along with other psychiatric symptoms. The dynamics of handwritten records served as one of the dominant mechanisms which support PD detection and assessment. Several machine learning methods have been investigated for the early detection of this disease. But most of these handcrafted feature extraction techniques predominantly suffer from low performance accuracy issues. This cannot be tolerable for dealing with detection of such a chronic ailment. To this end, an efficient deep learning model is proposed which can assist to have early detection of Parkinson’s disease.

In this study, we employ a user-centered design process with an aim to improve the wearability of gloves through a multi-phase study involving 23 people with PD (PwPD). The goal was to design gloves with suitable wrist closure and finger insertion mechanisms to enable independent upper-body movement assessments. The first phase conducted with 4 PwPD helped identify preferred and undesired glove-wearing mechanics through 12 daily living tasks. Next, a rapid prototyping process for textiles, using a laser cutter, produced three design concepts for evaluation by 9 PwPD. The best-performing prototype design was chosen for capacitive sensing thread integration and design revision. The capacitive sensing threads play a crucial role in accurately measuring finger flexion and extension, providing high-resolution data on hand movements that are critical for assessing finger movements associated with Parkinson's Disease symptoms. After incorporating participant feedback, the improved design had an average reduction of 23% in time to wear and 250% in time to take off when tested with 18 PwPD. In particular, features such as a view window for fingers and use of zippers had been reported by participants to improve glove usability.","","978-3-00-080429-8","10.23919/E-Textiles63767.2024.10914184","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1652538,1919135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10914184","Parkinson's Disease;E-Textiles;Rapid Prototyping;Adaptive Clothing;Accessiblity Design;Movement Impairments;Capacitive sensing","Wrist;Technological innovation;Parkinson's disease;User centered design;Writing;Rapid prototyping;Sensors;Usability;Yarn;Textiles","","","","38","","14 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a method to signify functional neurodegeneration of PD with dynamic functional connectivity analysis. A functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based experimental paradigm was designed to capture brain activation from 50 PD patients and 41 age-matched healthy controls in clinical walking tests. Dynamic functional connectivity was constructed with sliding-window correlation analysis, and k-means clustering was applied to generate the key brain connectivity states. Dynamic state features including state occurrence probability, state transition percentage and state statistical features were extracted to quantify the variations of brain functional networks. A support vector machine was trained to classify PD patients and healthy controls. Statistical analysis was conducted to investigate the difference between PD patients and healthy controls as well as the relationship between dynamic state features and the MDS-UPDRS sub-score of gait. The results showed that PD patients had a higher probability of transiting to brain connectivity states with high levels of information transmission compared with healthy controls. The MDS-UPDRS sub-score of gait and the dynamics state features showed a significant correlation. Moreover, the proposed method had better classification performances than the available fNIRS-based methods in terms of accuracy and F1 score. Thus, the proposed method well signified functional neurodegeneration of PD, and the dynamic state features may serve as promising functional biomarkers for PD diagnosis.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3242263","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1913208,61873135); Science and Technology Program of Tianjin(grant numbers:21JCZDJC00170); Tianjin Health Research Project(grant numbers:TJWJ2022MS033,TJWJ2022MS031); Tianjin Key Medical Discipline (Specialty) Construction Project(grant numbers:TJYXZDXK-052B); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036451","Parkinson’s disease;functional neurodegeneration;fNIRS;dynamic functional connectivity;dynamic state features","Legged locomotion;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy;Feature extraction;Diseases;Correlation;Neurology;Medical diagnostic imaging","","19","","58","CCBY","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 18 patients with PD were recruited and randomly assigned to the SE group, TT training group or control exercise group and participated in 12 30 min training sessions focusing on balance and streng-thening, TT training, or general exercise training, respectively, followed by 10 min of over-ground walking in each session for 4 to 6 weeks. The outcomes included alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD), beta ERD, postural control ability indicated by postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD), the step/quick turn test (SQT), and the sensory organization test (SOT). All measurements were assessed at baseline and after training. The results ( ${n} =6$  for each group) showed that both the SE and TT groups had improved beta ERD, but not alpha ERD, in the Cz area, PIGD score, and turn sway/time in the SQT compared with the CE group. Furthermore, postural control ability was positively correlated with beta ERD in the Cz area. However, there was no significant correlation between SOT total score and alpha ERD in the Cz area. This paper showed that beta ERD in the central area and postural control can be improved with balance training, along with lower extremity muscle strengthening exercise and TT training, in patients with PD.

Objective: This study aimed to determine whether similar reductions occur in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD), characterized primarily by motor impairments. Specifically, it aimed to characterize electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) power spectra during a motor task, assess CM phase connectivity, and explore how an additional cognitive task modulates these measures. Methodology: Fifteen individuals with early-stage PD and sixteen age-matched controls performed an isometric knee extension task, a cognitive task, and a combined dual task, while EEG (128 channels) and EMG (2x32 channels) were recorded. CM phase connectivity was analyzed through phase coherence and phase dynamics modeling. Results: The strongest CM phase coherence was observed in the lower beta band (12.5–15 Hz) over the Cz electrode and was significantly higher in healthy controls compared to individuals with PD during the motor task. The phase dynamics model additionally revealed stronger directional coupling from the Cz electrode to the active muscle, than in the reverse direction, with less pronounced phase coupling in the PD cohort. Notably, CM phase coherence exhibited distinct scalp topography and spectra characteristics compared to the EEG power spectrum, suggesting different mechanisms underlying Parkinsonian pathological beta power increase and CM phase connectivity. Lastly, despite high inter-individual variability, these metrics may prove useful for personalized assessments, particularly in people with heightened CM connectivity.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3527578","Slovenian Research Agency via the Research Program Knowledge Technologies(grant numbers:P2-0103); research projects(grant numbers:J1-3033,J2-2505,J2-4452,J2-4660,J3-3070,J4-3095,J5-4575,J7-4636,J7-4637,N2-0236); EC via the projects ASSAS(grant numbers:101059682); ELIAS(grant numbers:101120237); INQUIRE(grant numbers:101057499); PARC(grant numbers:101057014); TAILOR(grant numbers:952215); HORIZON EUROPE Framework Programme(grant numbers:101120150); Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency: Research Program Kinesiology for Quality of Life(grant numbers:P5-0381); Research Project Adaptation and Sensorimotor Processing during Increased Gravity Gradients(grant numbers:J7-4601); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10835798","Cortico-muscular connectivity;dynamic Bayesian inference;early-stage Parkinson’s disease;EEG;EMG;isometric knee extension;motor-cognitive dual tasks;phase coherence;phase dynamics model","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Electromyography;Coherence;Motors;Diseases;Couplings;Electrodes;Oscillators;Protocols","","","","147","CCBY","9 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) controller is designed to solve the above problem and further to improve the performance of the closed-loop control strategy. The training data set of the BPNN controller is obtained by controlling eight different PD states (PDa - PDh) by the PID controller and the BPNN controller is trained by the training data set to obtain a set of optimal weights. By modulating other different PD states (e.g. PD1 - PD3), the effectiveness of the PID-structure controller and BPNN controller are compared. We find that the BPNN controller can modulate different PD states without changing the controller parameters and reduce energy expenditure by 58.26%.

Gait signals are essential for identifying PD, and various techniques have been employed for classification, with a focus on spatiotemporal factors. Additionally, cognitive monitoring systems for PD symptoms have been developed. Recent advancements involve decomposing gait signals using techniques such as empirical mode decomposition (EMD), empirical wavelet transform (EWT), and variational mode decomposition (VMD) to streamline data for improved computational efficiency. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are widely used to enhance classification accuracy. This study integrates decomposition techniques with ML algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), decision trees (DTs), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs), as well as DL algorithms such as long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for PD classification. The combination of VMD with the 1D-CNN achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, with values of 99.1 %, 100 %, and 100 %, respectively. This finding suggests a promising approach for further research in this field.

A secondary goal was to determine more objectively the stage of the disease reducing the discomfort of scales subjectivity. Our sample integrated 103 patients (45 female and 58 male, 70.5±8.4 years) diagnosed with PD by neurologists specialized in movement disorders. Postural Behavior was evaluated using Computerized Dynamic Posturography equipment (Balance Master System). Postural behavior was based on posturographic analysis of the center of pressure (CoP) time series (corresponding to the vertical projection of the center of gravity) to determine kinematic parameter(s) considered suitable to identify postural behavior modification. The posturographic tests applied were: 1) modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB); 2) Limits of Stability (LOS); 3) Rhythmic Weight Shift (RWS). The results, concerning four stages of the H&Y scale (I-IV), showed significant differences between groups/stages. Static balance parameters like velocity, total distance, amplitude and frequency of CoP sway, increase with disease severity. In early to medium stages (I-II) of the disease, CoP presents a projection backwards, while in stage IV, this projection showed a trend to change forwards. Concerning dynamic balance, LOS presents a reduction mainly in the forward direction in all stages. The directional control in anterior-posterior RWS decreases with disease progression.","","978-1-5090-5727-6","10.1109/TISHW.2016.7847783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7847783","Postural Behavior;Computerized Dynamic Posturography;Parkinson Disease;clinical scales","Diseases;Visualization;Technological innovation;Kinematics;Stability analysis;Time series analysis;Handheld computers","","2","","37","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As this disease disrupts patients’ daily activities in a mature stage, early detection of the disease is crucial. Several methods based on nature-inspired (NI) algorithms have been proposed for PD detection and patient management. As there are several NI algorithms for feature selection, a mapping with an individual machine learning (ML) classifier is necessary to obtain optimal performance of the detection pipeline. To fill this gap, in this work, 13 NI algorithms and 11 ML classifiers were selected, and critical comparisons were performed regarding their combined performance in detecting PD. Each NI algorithm was employed to select an optimal feature set which was then classified by the 11 ML classifiers keeping the same parameters. This generated 143 NI-ML pairs, which were carefully compared to find the best-performing pairs considering several assessment criteria such as accuracy, cross-validation mean score, precision, recall and F1-score. The results of the extensive comparative analysis allowed the ranking of the algorithms in the 50th, 75th and 95th percentile to identify the best-performing pairs. The analyses revealed that 12 NI-ML models obtained a testing accuracy of over 91%, which is above the 95th percentile value.

Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) of the dopamine transporter (DAT) is a sensitive and specific imaging tool, but expensive and not advisable as screening means. Wearable devices are developing such effective and affordable supports for clinicians. This work aims to be a pilot study of future tremor classification.

However, because it remains difficult to sensitively evaluate symptom progression, testing of therapies which change the disease course has been hampered (and no such therapy is yet licensed). The more recent use of home monitoring systems provides the potential for providing granular assessment of symptom progression, specifically, tremor evaluation, by continuous monitoring using inertial measurement units. A significant barrier remains in obtaining the ground truth information to assess inference models in these non-laboratory environments. Given these limitations, in this paper we propose a machine learning tremor regression model and classifier heuristic that uses minimal annotations. We use a real-world dataset of 12 participants, where pairs of participants, one with PD and a healthy control, are monitored over a four-day period in a home environment with wrist-worn devices. Our approach leverages the accelerometer frequency-time representation. We evaluate the classifier heuristic on the control participants. The tremor score regression model is trained on the self-assessments of the participants. We show that the tremor classifier can achieve false positive rates (FPR) less than 0.001 (on average one false positive every five hours) on control participants. For a particular participant, we show that the machine learning regression model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.46 as compared to a polynomial regression model (degree=3) with MAE of 0.99.

Researchers have proposed a variety of wearable devices to mitigate PD tremors. However, these devices require accurate tremor detection technology to work effectively while the tremor occurs. This paper introduces a PD action tremor detection method to recognize PD tremors from regular activities. We used a dataset from 30 PD patients wearing accelerometers and gyroscope sensors on their wrists. We selected time-domain and frequency-domain hand-crafted features. Also, we compared our hand-crafted features with existing CNN data-driven features, and our features have more specific boundaries in 2-D feature visualization using the t-SNE tool. We fed our features into multiple supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for detecting PD action tremors. These models were evaluated with 30 PD patients' data.

For the cases of which prior edge annotations are not available, a data-driven based adjacency estimation method is further proposed. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on vision-based FoG detection using deep neural networks designed for graph sequences of dynamic structures.

To address this challenging task, we propose a multiplane embedding and spatial-temporal Transformer (MEST) framework for PD diagnosis. Firstly, we project structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) into 2D images from coronal, sagittal and axial directions, respectively. Then, the multi-plane dynamic images are learned by pre-trained VGG11 and attention mechanism for representation learning. Afterwards, time series information of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to construct dynamic functional connection images. To capture information changes in brain, spatial-temporal connectivity Transformer (SCTransformer) is utilized to address spatial-temporal redundancy and dependencies. To integrate multimodality data, ensemble learning is designed based on majority voting strategy to perform PD diagnosis. We evaluate the proposed method on 279 subjects from an in-house and Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental results show that the MEST achieves promising performance with accuracies of 0.856 and 0.885, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-6654-6819-0","10.1109/BIBM55620.2022.9995498","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; Central South University; Central South University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9995498","Parkinson’s disease;Multi-modality;Multiplane;Spatial-temporal","Representation learning;Time series analysis;Redundancy;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Transformers;Medical diagnosis;Ensemble learning","","4","","26","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional tremor detection methods have mainly focused on resting state. However, resting tremor is not always sufficient to accurately distinguish PD tremor from other tremor disorders such as essential tremor. Examining tremor during movement provides additional diagnostic value, but also has challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect Parkinsonian hand tremor at walking state by exploiting the periodic synchronization between arm swings and leg steps that is observed in natural walking, specifically by using a wrist-worn sensor to capture the characteristic hand tremor that is induced during walking in Parkinson’s patients. Our method first applies a dynamic scanning mechanism to screen out valid walking fragments from whole walking sequence. We then exploit walking periodicity to combine time and frequency domain features, and design two new accelerometer-based features, Average Peak Interval Time (APIT) and Average Peak Frequency (APF), which capture the characteristic amplitude and frequency patterns of PD tremors during natural walking movements. Finally, unlike traditional approaches that use uniform feature weighting, our proposed variance adaptive AdaBoost (VA-AdaBoost) algorithm uniquely incorporates accelerometer signal variance to adaptively weight samples for feature training. The results of our five-fold cross-validation experimental evaluation using the PD-BioStampRC21 dataset show that our method achieved an accuracy of 86.67% and an AUC score of 95.56%, representing a significant improvement over the baseline model’s accuracy of 72.67% and surpassing other existing methods. Our method enables more accurate detection of subtle tremor patterns in real-world conditions compared to conventional methods. The proposed method has shown potential in the integration of wearable sensors and ensemble learning techniques for the early and accessible diagnosis of Parkinsonian hand tremor, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and treatment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3534293","Technology Innovation Program (20014967, Development of Digital Therapeutics for Depression from COVID-19); Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE, Korea) and 2024 Digital Therapeutics Development and Demonstration project; Ministry of Science and ICT and the National IT Industry Promotion Agency but may differ from the official opinions of the Ministry of Science and ICT and the National IT Industry Promotion Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10854462","Parkinson’s disease;ensemble learning;machine learning;tremor detection","Legged locomotion;Accelerometers;Feature extraction;Ensemble learning;Hands;Accuracy;Time-frequency analysis;Wearable sensors;Low-pass filters;Monitoring","","","","43","CCBY","27 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Very few researches attempted to identify the emotion impairment in PD through EEG signals. The main objective of this work is to classify the emotions perceived by the PD subjects through audio-visual stimuli using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG database of 20 subjects on PD and 20 NC is developed using a 14 channel wireless EEG device at a sampling frequency of 128 Hz. Audiovisual stimuli of six emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust) are used to induce the emotions. The acquired EEG signals are pre-processed using the IIR Butterworth filter to remove the noises, artifacts, and interferences in EEG signals and used to derive three frequency bands (alpha, beta and gamma) of EEG data. Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is used to extract the two most significant features (Maximum Line Length, Maximum Vertical Line Length) from Recurrence Plot (RP). Besides, these features are combined together called ALL features. Therefore, three types of features were tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) to test its significance in classifying emotions in PD and NC and a five-fold cross-validation method is used to split the features into training and testing set. Finally, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier with two different types of kernel functions used to classify the emotions of PD and NC. The maximum mean accuracy of 89.17%, 84.50% is achieved on NC and PD, respectively. The maximum individual class accuracy of NC/PD is sadness - 90.90/87.50, happiness - 91.10/84.30, fear- 88/84.10, disgust - 88.5/82.70, surprise - 87.4/84.60, and anger - 89.10/83.80. Experimental results indicate that RQA features are highly useful in detecting the emotions in PD compared to other methods and ELM gives the highest mean accuracy compared to other works in the literature.","","978-1-7281-5310-0","10.1109/CSPA48992.2020.9068709","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9068709","Emotion classification;Extreme Learning Machine;Recurrence Quantification Analysis;Parkinson's Disease;Electroencephalogram (EEG)","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;IIR filters;Analysis of variance;Parkinson's disease;Length measurement","","12","","13","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from wearable devices are used to recognize rest, posture, and kinetic tremor action from six upper limb clinical actions and to quantify features of tremors. A multivariable time-series classification model (MTSCM) based on fully convolutional networks and a long short-term memory network is proposed to recognize tremor actions. MTSCM achieves a high degree of accuracy both on the left-hand and right-hand data sets for tremor actions. An improved Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) method is proposed to decompose the inertial signals of tremor actions to obtain tremor components. Using the improved HHT, tremor and motion components can be decomposed effectively. In addition, 53 features are extracted from inertial and sEMG signals, and a canonical correlation analysis is used to determine the correlation between features and movement disorder society unified PD rating scale (MDS-UPDRS) scores. Several of the relevant characteristics are related to MDS-UPDRS scores, notably the dominant frequency and amplitude of the tremor component are significantly correlated ( ${p}$  < 0.01) with tremor scores.

This algorithm is composed of multiple adaptive modified Hopf oscillators linear combiner. The combiner is divided into two parts: one is used to estimate tremor motion and the other is applied to estimate voluntary motion. As it is updated iteratively in real time, this method has no phase delay. The performance of the proposed method was verified by the simulated action tremor and the actual experimental results of twenty Parkinson's disease patients. For the rest tremor signals of patients, the mean Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values between the estimated signal and the actual signal was 0.0272±0.0077. The mean RMSE values between the estimated voluntary movement from action tremor and the actual voluntary movement were 0.0360±0.0097 (pick and put motion) and 0.0380±0.0083 (drawing motion).

By evaluating the fluctuations of dynamic functional connectivity and the transition stability of functional network state in ePD-MCI patients compared with early PD without mild cognitive impairment patients, it was found that in the alpha band, the functional network stability of central region, right frontal, parietal, occipital, and left temporal lobes was abnormally increased, and the dynamic connectivity fluctuations in these regions were significantly decreased in ePD-MCI group. In the gamma band, ePD-MCI patients showed decreased functional network stability in the central, left frontal, and right temporal lobes, and active dynamic connectivity fluctuations in the left frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.

Symptoms start gradually, where tremors are the most common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. Parkinson’s disease signs and symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs may be mild and go unnoticed. Many of the symptoms are due to loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in the brain called dopamine. Early detection of the disease allows rapid intervention, which is important because in most cases it is not possible to recover from. It is only possible to slow down or better, to stop progression but not to reverse damage that has already incurred. Eye tremors are prevalent in PD illness and could be an initial warning for the neurodegenerative disorder. In the very early stages of the disease, these eye tremors are very small that make it impossible to be detected by naked eyes. We are proposing to use a new technology developed by MIT to generate motion magnification from recorded videos. The technology, called phase based video magnification, can be used for providing a convenient solution to detect ocular tremor. By capturing then analyzing and interpreting the results of recorded videos using smartphone’s camera, we can obtain a low-cost and widely available early diagnostic system.

Nevertheless, specialists estimate that there are still undetected cases due to external variables such as medical expense and diagnosis accuracy. Because of the slow course of symptoms, early detection and diagnosis of PD have become a challenge in the medical field. Due to the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, patients face reduced motor activities. The symptoms are mainly divided into two categories: i) motor symptoms such as tremors, and slowness of movement; and, ii) non-motor symptoms such as insomnia, sadness, etc. Tremor is one of the first and most prevalent symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, and ignoring it at this point could have a serious detrimental influence on the patient’s health.

A pattern, such as a spiral or a line, in polar coordinates is a straight line or a curve that can be easily compared to a hand-drawn pattern with the same coordinates. Hence, in this study, using polar expression features, the deviation (cm), the accumulation angle (rad), and the drawing velocity (cm/s) were extracted to scale the variability in different tremor levels associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) or essential tremor (ET). Then, a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier was used to separate the normal condition from PD or ET. The classifier was trained by the wolf pack search (WPS) optimization method. Tremor level progress was evaluated by integrating an assistive method in a smart mobile device (iPad), along with the nonlinear SVM-based classifier, into a decision-making system for individualized functions. In contrast to the multilayer machine learning method, with the 8-fold cross-validation, the proposed classifier exhibits superior performance in identifying normal controls and PD or ET, with the mean true positive, mean true negative, and mean hit rates being 93.72%, 86.79%, and 90.84%, respectively. The experimental results indicated that the proposed decision-making method is effective for detecting the progression of Parkinson-related diseases. This examination technique is simple, comfortable, and repeatable for helping neurologists with preliminary diagnoses, drug treatments, and at-home monitoring.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2019.2940694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835101","Polar expression feature;deviation;accumulation angle;drawing velocity;nonlinear support vector machine","Spirals;Sensors;Diseases;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Tablet computers;Monitoring","","10","","37","IEEE","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the power spectral density (PSD) of low-frequency bands (δ and θ) and high-frequency bands (α and β) has been shown to be significantly different in patients with PD as compared to subjects without PD (non-PD). However, rs-EEG feature extraction and the interpretation thereof can be time-intensive and prone to examiner variability. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to automatize the analysis of rs-EEG recordings and provides a supportive tool for clinicians to ease their workload. In this work, we use rs-EEG recordings of 84 PD and 85 non-PD subjects pooled from four datasets obtained at different centers. We propose an end-to-end pipeline consisting of preprocessing, extraction of PSD features from clinically-validated frequency bands, and feature selection. Following, we assess the classification ability of the features via ML algorithms to stratify between PD and non-PD subjects. Further, we evaluate the effect of feature harmonization, given the multi-center nature of the datasets. Our validation results show, on average, an improvement in PD detection ability (69.6% vs. 75.5% accuracy) by logistic regression when harmonizing the features and performing univariate feature selection (k = 202 features). Our final results show an average global accuracy of 72.2% with balanced accuracy results for all the centers included in the study: 60.6%, 68.7%, 77.7%, and 82.2%, respectively.Clinical relevance— We present an end-to-end pipeline to extract clinically relevant features from rs-EEG recordings that can facilitate the analysis and detection of PD.

However, out-of-lab tests often suffer from poor quality controls as well as irregularly collected observations, leading to noisy test results. To address these issues, we propose a novel time-series based approach to predicting Parkinson's Disease with raw activity test data collected by smartphones in the wild. The proposed method first synchronizes discrete activity tests into multimodal features at unified time points. Next, it distills and enriches local and global representations from noisy data across modalities and temporal observations by two attention modules.

Methods: A publicly available gait dataset consisting of four groups: healthy adults, people with Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was used. The topological properties of the configuration space of three gait parameters were studied by approximating the underlying distribution through a Gaussian kernel-based density estimation technique. Thereafter, sublevel sets of the density estimate were analyzed using cubical persistence homology. Results: Three new features were constructed: 1. Probability density estimates (PDEs) that characterize the distribution of gait parameters over their configuration space. Healthy adults exhibited a unimodal distribution, while people with neurodegenerative disorders displayed a multi-modal distribution. 2. Persistence entropy plots that summarize changes in the PDEs and characterize the uncertainty in the underlying distribution. Gait of healthy adults was concentrated at higher entropy values as opposed to neurodegenerative gait. 3. A number $\alpha _{s}$ that captures disease severity trends. Conclusions: Topological features in PD and HD indicate a ‘bias’ to a certain set of gait configurations. This lack of exploration may reflect poor planning of the underlying topology, resulting in outward manifestations of impaired gait. The lower variegations in PDEs in ALS compared to PD and HD suggest that the planning of the topology of gait may occur at higher levels of the neural architecture. Significance: TGA offers characterization of gait at a hitherto uncharted level, potentially serving neuromotor markers for early diagnosis and personalized rehabilitation protocols.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3427700","Indian Institute of Technology Bombay; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10779507","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;human gait;Huntington's disease;Parkinson's disease;persistence homology;rehabilitation;topological gait analysis","Pathology;Protocols;Feature extraction;Entropy;Topology;Legged locomotion;Gaussian processes;Parkinson's disease","Humans;Gait Analysis;Adult;Male;Female;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Gait;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Aged;Huntington Disease;Gait Disorders, Neurologic","","","25","IEEE","5 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps to regulate motor functions. Deficiency of dopamine causes symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and slowness of movements. In PD, the brain cells in the substantia nigra region responsible for the production of dopamine slowly die off. There are several ways to identify PD, such as gait analysis, neuroimaging techniques, and voice pattern recognition. Additionally, PD can be effectively detected using handwriting by examining different patterns such as spirals, digits, waves, and other structured drawing tasks. In this work, we proposed a PD detection method using an ensemble machine learning (ML) approach i.e. Extra Tree (ET) classifier, combined with explainability techniques. The model utilized handwriting patterns including spirals, loops, meanders, and digits collected using mobile devices providing accurate predictions and interpretable insights into key features influencing the classification. To increase the model performance and robustness, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, width and height shifting, and horizontal flipping were applied to the image data, complemented by preprocessing steps to normalize and structure the data. These steps significantly contributed to achieving an accuracy of 89.27%. The combination of preprocessing, augmentation, and the robust ML model ensures reliable and interpretable detection of PD based on handwriting patterns.

Its evaluation is based on a careful assessment of symptoms and it is quantified using rating scales, where the Movement Disorders Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is the gold standard. Regardless of their importance, the bradykinesia-related items show low agreement between different evaluators. In this study, we design an applicable tool that provides an objective quantification of bradykinesia and that evaluates all characteristics described in the MDS-UPDRS. Twenty-five patients with Parkinson's disease performed three of the five bradykinesia-related items of the MDS-UPDRS. Their movements were assessed by four evaluators and were recorded with a nine degrees-of-freedom sensor. Sensor fusion was employed to obtain a 3-D representation of movements. Based on the resulting signals, a set of features related to the characteristics described in the MDS-UPDRS was defined. Feature selection methods were employed to determine the most important features to quantify bradykinesia. The features selected were used to train support vector machine classifiers to obtain an automatic score of the movements of each patient. The best results were obtained when seven features were included in the classifiers. The classification errors for finger tapping, diadochokinesis and toe tapping were 15-16.5%, 9.3-9.8%, and 18.2-20.2% smaller than the average interrater scoring error, respectively. The introduction of objective scoring in the assessment of bradykinesia might eliminate inconsistencies within evaluators and interrater assessment disagreements and might improve the monitoring of movement disorders.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2480242","Mexican National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272072","Bradykinesia;Clinical diagnosis;Computer aided diagnosis;Sensor Fusion;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Bradykinesia;clinical diagnosis;computer-aided diagnosis;sensor fusion;supervised learning;support vector machines (SVMs)","Magnetic sensors;Fingers;Standards;Support vector machines;Classification algorithms;Sensor fusion","Aged;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Fingers;Humans;Hypokinesia;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Supervised Machine Learning;Support Vector Machine","56","","33","IEEE","18 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Speech symptoms represent as one of the earliest motor indications, exhibited by approximately ninety percent of PD patients. There is a need for prediction of PD based on speech symptoms using machine learning techniques in order to delay the progression of the disorder. The proposed framework performs an early prediction of PD using ensemble classifiers to the speech features dataset which has been retrieved from UCI repository. The speech features dataset consists of multiple feature subsets of 252 subjects with each subject of three speech feature instances. The highly correlated features are integrated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) without any loss of information. The prediction of PD is performed using ensemble classifiers because prediction results are enhanced by combining several same or different models. The various ensemble classifiers used in the analysis of PD prediction are bagging, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost). The ensemble classifiers are fed with the optimal parameters procured using hyper parameters tuning process such as random search and grid search. Ensemble classifier models are evaluated based on the metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score and Support. The experimental results show that PCA performs better than LDA, grid search hyper parameters tuning process provides improved results than random search and the prediction results signifies that boosting classifier provides higher accuracy than bagging classifier.","","978-1-7281-4210-4","10.1109/ICITIIT49094.2020.9071562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9071562","PCA;Ensemble Classifier;Hyperparameter tuning;AdaBoost;GBM;XgBoost","Principal component analysis;Boosting;Training;Bagging;Testing;Tuning;Predictive models","","12","","15","IEEE","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early identification of PD is essential for prompt intervention and better patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic techniques, often reliant on clinical symptoms, may delay accurate diagnosis, particularly in the early stages of the disease. This paper establishes an innovative approach based on a deep learning framework, specifically the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) algorithm, to facilitate the early diagnosis of PD by analyzing MRI brain images. By leveraging YOLOv8's object detection capabilities, this model is trained on extensively annotated medical imaging datasets, focusing on identifying subtle biomarkers associated with PD. The proposed model offers a non-invasive, automated diagnostic tool that surpasses the performance of traditional and existing AI-based models. The proposed model achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, with a precision of 97% and a recall of 96%, highlighting its robust detection capabilities. Additionally, the model’s ability to process and analyze MRI images in real time provides clinicians with an efficient diagnostic aid, potentially integrating seamlessly into routine clinical workflows. These results depend on the deep learning framework's capacity to improve diagnostic precision, reduce the time required for diagnosis, and contribute to early intervention strategies for PD patients.

The paper describes the application of salient tracking tools like magnetic trackers and optical markers, electrical diagnostic practices like Electromyogram (EMG) and the use of Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensor modules(a combination of 3 axes accelerometer + 3 axes gyroscope) to record movement. The IMU and electrodes were suitably mounted on the hands of subjects who were made to perform certain pre-defined actions to record the wrist movement and electrical activity simultaneously. The ability of a subject to precisely follow a pre-defined task's motion trajectory is a crucial indicator of tremor. In this paper we study two techniques of trajectory measurement, in terms of the accuracy of measurement of the slightest deviations from a prescribed trajectory. It is shown that an IMU based motion tracking is more accurate than that tracked by EMG sensors.","","978-1-4673-9802-2","10.1109/ICRTIT.2016.7569560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7569560","Parkinson's disease;Tremors;Accelerometer;Gyroscope;Electromyography","Electromyography;Accelerometers;Semiconductor device measurement;Gyroscopes;Muscles;Tracking;Electrodes","","11","","21","IEEE","19 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we proposed one algorithm that used linear classifiers to detect in real-time the transition between consecutive gait phases. Our approach is a generalization of the rule- and threshold-based algorithms for event detection. Linear classifiers are parametric models that require appropriate values in order to perform correct classification of the gait phases. We introduced a modified Support Vector Machine (SVM) to compute such sub-optimal combinations of those values, and a further optimization with a hybrid meta-heuristic approach that integrates a Genetic and a Simulated Annealing Algorithm. We tested our approach on data collected by a single-IMU foot-mounted wearable device during overground and treadmill walking for two groups: one with healthy and one with Parkinson's Disease subjects.

In previous studies, 24 motion signals (the so-called reaching tasks) of the upper limbs of PD patients and Healthy Controls (HCs) were used to extract several kinematic features through a custom-made software; conversely, the aim of our paper is to investigate the possibility to build models–using these features–for distinguishing PD patients from HCs. First, a binary logistic regression and, then, a Machine Learning (ML) analysis was performed by implementing five algorithms through the Knime Analytics Platform. The ML analysis was performed twice: first, a leave-one out-cross validation was applied; then, a wrapper feature selection method was implemented to identify the best subset of features that could maximize the accuracy. The binary logistic regression achieved an accuracy of 90.5%, demonstrating the importance of the maximum jerk during subjects upper limb motion; the Hosmer-Lemeshow test supported the validity of this model (p-value=0.408). The first ML analysis achieved high evaluation metrics by overcoming 95% of accuracy; the second ML analysis achieved a perfect classification with 100% of both accuracy and area under the curve receiver operating characteristics. The top-five features in terms of importance were the maximum acceleration, smoothness, duration, maximum jerk and kurtosis. The investigation carried out in our work has proved the predictive power of the features, extracted from the reaching tasks involving the upper limbs, to distinguish HCs and PD patients.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2023.3236834","Project “Rehabilitative Personalized Home System and Virtual Coaching for Chronic Treatment in elderly (Re-HUB-ility)” - ID number 1175272, through the Call HUB Ricerca e Innovazione, Regione Lombardia, (D.G.R.

On the other hand, 2 indicators of gait rhythm fluctuation, coefficient of variation (CV) and scaling exponent α, can evaluate severity of PD. However the gait training was not evaluated by both of these indicators at a time. In this paper, we aim to propose rhythm-fluctuation-based evaluation platform for gait training of PD patients. This platform consists of CV and α of stride interval. Specifically, we evaluated 3 types of gait training by calculating the change amount of CV and α. The training types are 1) interactive Walk-Mate (WM) gait training, 2) fixed-tempo Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) gait training, and 3) Silent Control gait training. The training program was continued for 4 days. The first trial in each day was baseline walking trial without rhythmic cue. The second and the third trials were training trial corresponding to the training condition. Twenty-four PD patients walked for about 2 minutes in each trial. These patients divided into 3 groups about training type. As a result, WM gait training improved α and CV significantly. RAS gait training tended to improve CV, but it seemed to worsen a of gait rhythm. These effects of RAS gait training were marginally significant. However, Silent Control training did not show the significant effect on both of the indicators. From these results, the rhythm-fluctuation-based evaluation platform was successfully used to evaluate each type of gait training. In addition, the rhythm-fluctuation-based evaluation platform detected the difference between WM gait training and RAS gait training by α.","","978-1-4673-7242-8","10.1109/SII.2015.7405069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405069","","Training;Rhythm;Fluctuations;Trajectory;Legged locomotion;Time series analysis;Oscillators","","","","21","IEEE","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed method allows for abrupt changes in network structure via a fused least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) scheme, as well as recovery of time-varying networks with smoothly changing coefficients via a weighted regression technique. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method yields improved accuracy on estimating time-dependent connectivity patterns when compared to a static sparse regression model or a weighted time-varying regression model. When applied to real resting-state fMRI datasets from Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects, significantly different temporal and spatial patterns were found to be associated with PD. Specifically, PD subjects demonstrated reduced network variability over time, which may be related to impaired cognitive flexibility previously reported in PD. The temporal dynamic properties of brain connectivity in PD subjects may provide insights into brain dynamics associated with PD and may serve as a potential biomarker in future studies.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2359211","PPRI/UBC Chair in Parkinson's Disease (MJM); Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905798","Brain connectivity network;dynamic;functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);Parkinson's disease (PD);time varying","Vectors;Biological system modeling;Mathematical model;Brain models;Data models","Brain;Computer Simulation;Connectome;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Humans;Models, Statistical;Nerve Net;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Rest;Sensitivity and Specificity","23","","41","IEEE","19 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, previous investigations only focused on the locomotor patterns of each individual foot rather than the relations between both feet. Therefore, in our study, phase synchronization (the index ρ) and conditional entropy (Hc) were applied to the five types of time series pairs of gait rhythms (stride time, swing time, stance time, % swing time and % stance time). The results revealed that compared with the patients with ALS, HD and PD, gait rhythms of normal subjects have the strongest phase synchronization property and minimum conditional entropy value. In addition, the indices ρ and Hc cannot only significantly differentiate among the four groups of subjects (ALS, HD, PD and control) but also have the ability to discriminate between any two of these subject groups. Finally, three representative classifiers were utilized in order to evaluate the possible capabilities of the indices ρ and Hc to distinguish the patients with neurodegenerative diseases from the healthy subjects, and achieved maximum area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.959, 0.928 and 0.824 for HD, PD and ALS detection, respectively.

This paper suggests a Fuzzy-Based Neurodiagnostic System that utilizes the UCI Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset to classify early PD cases by integrating fuzzy logic and a deep neural network. 22 biomedical voice features, such as average fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio (NHR), and non-linear dynamical measures such as DFA and PPE, are included in the dataset. These features are captured from sustained phonation recordings. The interpretability of vocal irregularities is improved by the fuzzy logic module, which assigns fuzzy membership values (low, medium, high) based on clinical thresholds while processing three important uncertainty-prone features—jitter, shimmer, and NHR. These fuzzified outputs, in conjunction with the normalized raw features, are fed into a four-layer fully connected neural network (FCNN) that utilizes ReLU and Tanh activations. The first hidden layer consists of 64 neurons, while the subsequent layers contain 32 and 16 neurons, respectively. For binary classification (PD or non-PD), the output layer implements a Sigmoid activation. The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and 10-fold cross-validation, as well as the Adam optimiser. It outperformed conventional classifiers, including SVM and Decision Trees, with 94.8% accuracy, 92.3% precision, and 96.1% recall in this study.

For example, researchers have reported that individuals suffering from unilateral Osteoarthritis (OA) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) often demonstrate short stride length, increased stride asymmetry while using both legs and appreciable variability in stride-to-stride length, which in turn can lead to instability in gait and risk of falls. Given the importance of quantifying the strides in real-time during an overground walk, wearable solutions are being explored. Researchers have used various wearable solutions, e.g., those having Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), and insoles instrumented with Force Sensitive Resistors, to quantify anyone of the gait disorders. Though these studies have been promising, yet this leaves scope to further investigate the applicability of such wearable solutions across various gait abnormalities with an aim to quantify various types of gait disorders while distinguishing different types of gait disorders. Motivated by this need, we developed a wearable system (SmartStride) comprised of IMUs and instrumented insoles to measure attributes related to strides being taken during one's overground walk. Results of our study involving 24 age-matched participants (healthy elderly and those with OA and PD) show the potential of SmartStride to quantify strides across healthy gait and gait disorders (OA and PD), differences in the strides being taken by elderly with OA and PD along with the extent of the disorder, thereby showing its clinical relevance.","2573-3028","979-8-3503-8340-9","10.1109/IECBES61011.2024.10990797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10990797","Gait Quantification;Inertial Measurement Units;Instrumented Insoles Wearable Technology;Parkinson's Disease;Osteoarthritis","Legged locomotion;Wireless communication;Measurement units;Parkinson's disease;Instruments;Inertial navigation;Belts;Real-time systems;Osteoarthritis;Older adults","","","","20","IEEE","19 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Up to today, there is still no cure or prevention for PD, and usually the disease worsens gradually over time. However, this disease can be controlled with some treatment, especially in the early stage. Hence, this study proposes a method in early detection and diagnosis of PD by using the Multilayer Feedforward Neural Network (MLFNN) with Back-propagation (BP) algorithm. This MLFNN with BP algorithm is simulated using MATLAB software. The dataset information used in this study was taken from the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Detection Dataset. The output of the network is classified into healthy or PD by using K-Means Clustering algorithm. The performance of this classifier was evaluated based on the three parameters; sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The result shows that network can be used in diagnosis and detection of PD due to the good performance, which is 83.3% for sensitivity, 63.6% for specificity, and 80% for accuracy.","","978-1-4799-7975-2","10.1109/CITSM.2014.7042180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042180","","Accuracy;Diseases;Sensitivity;Neurons;Neural networks;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms","","25","","12","IEEE","16 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a gait-aid system built upon smart glasses. Our system continuously monitors the gait and so on of a PD patient to detect FOG, and upon detection of FOG it projects visual patterns on the glasses as if the patterns were actually on the floor.

The main focus of this paper is to examine correlations between electroencephalography (EEG) data and episodes of FOG. Ultimately, the goal of the project is the development of a machine-learning model capable of detecting instances of FOG in Parkinson's patients. EEG data was retrieved from an existing dataset, processed, and analyzed using linear regressions to evaluate relationships between the variables. Then, the data was run through four predictive models: a polynomial regression, a dense neural network, a Bayesian neural network, and an autoencoder. The dense neural network generated the best results for multi-patient data with an accuracy rate of 66%. However, when the Dense neural network analyzed data from an individual patient engaged in one task, its accuracy increased sharply to 80–94%. One potential application of this research would be the development of personal EEG tracking and Parkinson's symptom prediction systems.","","979-8-3503-0965-2","10.1109/URTC60662.2023.10534919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10534919","","Correlation;Parkinson's disease;Neural networks;Machine learning;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography","","1","","7","IEEE","24 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the disorganization of bilateral coordination assessed by gait asymmetry was also correlated with the degree of severity.

Brain age could act as a quantitative marker to evaluate the degree of the individual's brain evolution. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is sensitive to variations in magnetically responsive substances such as iron and myelin, making it a favorable tool for estimating brain age. In this study, we introduce an innovative 3D convolutional network named Segmentation-Transformer-Age-Network (STAN) to predict brain age based on QSM data. STAN employs a two-stage network architecture. The first-stage network learns to extract informative features from the QSM data through segmentation training, while the second-stage network predicts brain age by integrating the global and local features. We collected QSM images from 712 healthy participants, with 548 for training and 164 for testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved a high accuracy brain age prediction with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.124 years and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.933. Furthermore, the gaps between the predicted brain age and the chronological age of Parkinson's disease patients were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects (P<0.01). We thus believe that using QSM-based predicted brain age offers a more reliable and accurate phenotype, with the potentiality to serve as a biomarker to explore the process of advanced brain aging.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2023.3341629","Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:23TS1400200,21DZ1100301); Med-Engineering Crossing Foundation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University(grant numbers:20220103,YG2023LC0); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901256,91949120,62071299); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:ZXWH1082101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10354301","Brain age prediction;deep learning;Parkinson's disease;quantitative susceptibility mapping","Aging;Convolutional neural networks;Magnetic resonance imaging;Iron;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Deep learning;Parkinson's disease","Humans;Child, Preschool;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Brain;Brain Mapping;Aging;Iron","3","","68","IEEE","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effectiveness of the proposed method, BFO-SVM, was validated on a PD data set based on vocal measurements. The proposed method was compared with two of the most frequently used parameter optimization methods, including an SVM based on the grid search method and an SVM based on particle swarm optimization. Additionally, to further boost the prediction accuracy, the relief feature selection was employed prior to the BFO-SVM method, consequently the RF-BFO-SVM was proposed.
