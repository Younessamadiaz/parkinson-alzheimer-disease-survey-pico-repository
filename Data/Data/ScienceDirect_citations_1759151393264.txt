Abstract: Background
Previous studies have reported Parkinson's disease (PD) patients usually have changes in brain image-derived phenotypes (IDPs). However, the role of genetic factors in their association and biological mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to unveil genetic and biological links between brain IDPs and PD.
Methods
Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we performed a comprehensive analysis between 624 brain IDPs and PD. The genetic correlations and causality were examined by linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and meta-analysis. Potential shared genes were identified using MAGMA and PLACO. Finally, pathway enrichment using FUMA and Metascape, and scRNA-seq analysis were performed to determine biological mechanisms and gene expression atlas across various cell types in brain tissue.
Results
LDSC revealed that 50 brain IDPs were genetically correlated with PD (P < 0.05), in which 5 IDPs, exhibited putative causality on PD through MR (P < 0.05). For instance, we identified that the increased volume of the right thalamus (IVW: OR = 2.08, 95 % CI: 1.33 to 3.25, PFDR = 0.03) was positively correlated with the risk of PD, which was also supported by replicated MR (IVW: OR = 1.63, 95 % CI: 1.17–2.26, PFDR = 0.02) in FinnGen and meta-analysis (OR = 1.78, 95 % CI: 1.36–2.31, PFDR = 5.00 × 10−4). Additionally, we identified 56 unique pleiotropic genes, such as FAM13A, with notable enrichment in neuronal cells. Biological mechanism analysis revealed these genes were enriched in brain tissues and a variety of pathways such as negative regulation of neuron apoptotic processes.
Conclusion
We indicated the shared genetic architecture and biological mechanisms between brain IDPs and PD. These findings might provide insights on the therapeutic intervention and early prediction of PD at the brain imaging level.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative disease in the world at present. Neuroinflammation plays an important role in Parkinson's disease. In our study, we initially screened magnolol/honokiol derivatives synthesized by our group for their potential anti-neuroinflammatory properties. This was done using LPS-activated BV-2 microglial cell and MPP + -induced PC-12 cell models. Most of derivatives had increased anti-inflammatory activities and decreased toxicities compared to raw materials. Then, compounds were scored with inflammatory factors IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 by molecular docking in silico. Our studies revealed the strongest binding compound HM568 which binds with honokiol and metformin. Furthermore, HM568 showed no acute toxicity in mice through acute toxicity. And it is stable under high temperature, high humidity and strong light irradiation. Combining cell experiments and computer results, HM568 was considered for further in vivo pharmacological validations. Intraperitoneal injection administration of MPTP into C57BL/6 mice was utilized as Parkinson's animal model. Results showed that administration of HM568 for 14 days in MPTP-PD mice led to a significant alleviation in weight loss and movement disorders. Further HM568 could significantly down-regulate the expression levels of inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in brain tissue of the mouse model, reduce the level of caspase-3 and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and up-regulate the level of transforming factor TGF-β, thus producing anti-apoptosis and anti-neuroinflammatory effects on neuronal cells. In terms of pathological features, HM568 could reduce the infiltration of neuronal cells and alleviate the development of lesions, promote the transformation of microglia from M1 negative phenotype to M2 type, and reverse the reduction of TH-positive immune cells in mouse neurons induced by MPTP. The administration of HM568 could reduce the abnormal accumulation of α-syn, and thus produce neuroprotective effect on MPTP-PD mice. Cell experiments, molecular docking and animal experiments thus depict HM568 as a promising agent to delay neuronal degeneration in PD, and its mechanism is related to anti-neuroinflammation.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, typically treated with levodopa, which alleviates the motor symptoms of the disease. However, levodopa metabolism in peripheral tissues hampers its bioavailability and leads to undesired side-effects. Therefore, co-administration of amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors is necessary, but still, up to 50 % of levodopa may not reach the brain. Recent evidence suggests that gut microbes, especially Enterococcus faecalis, are also able to metabolize levodopa and affect the bioavailability by utilizing microbial tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) enzyme. The main aim of this study was to develop inhibitors targeting gut microbial and host decarboxylation of levodopa. First, a virtual screen of a library of 158,000 compounds against E. faecalis TyrDC was conducted, combining three methods: molecular docking against the E. faecalis TyrDC homology model, structure-based pharmacophore model, and shape similarity searches based on levodopa, carbidopa (AADC inhibitor) and (S)-α-fluoromethyltyrosine (TyrDC inhibitor). A total of 394 compounds were selected and tested in vitro by using a cell-based E. faecalis assay measuring inhibition of levodopa metabolism. Three most active compounds (49-92% inhibition at 100 µM) sharing a similar scaffold and a set of commercially available and in-house synthesized analogs were then assessed against purified TyrDC and AADC enzymes. The IC50 values for the most potent compounds for TyrDC and AADC inhibition were 23 µM / 102 µM (compound 1), 42 µM / 154 µM (compound 2) and 51 µM / 182 µM (compound 3), respectively. These compounds also displayed cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells and modest antibacterial activity against E. faecalis at the same concentration range. The core structure of the compounds presented here can serve as a starting point for the development of a new inhibitor class against TyrDC and AADC, and offers a promising avenue for personalized PD treatment, particularly for patients with high levels of gut microbes expressing the levodopa metabolizing TyrDC enzyme.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, with limited effective treatment options. This study proposes a novel approach utilizing intranasal delivery of carbenoxolone (CBX) via chitosan-coated solid lipid nanoparticles (CS-coated SLNs) to manage PD symptoms by enhancing CBX delivery and brain targeting. Formulated CS-coated SLNs exhibited favorable quality attributes including particle size (164 ± 0.12 nm), surface charge (18 ± 0.89 mV), high entrapment efficiency (97.98 ± 0.98 %), and sustained drug release profile. In vivo evaluations in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD involved intranasal administration of CBX suspension and CBX-loaded CS-coated SLN (equivalent to 20 mg/kg/day) over four weeks. The CBX nano-formulation group showed significant improvements in motor function, coordination, and balance, as well as modulation of neurotransmitter levels, with increased dopamine and decreased α-synuclein levels compared to the control group. Moreover, the CBX nano-formulation exhibited superior efficacy in reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis markers. Histological examination revealed restored neuronal architecture, suggesting potential neuroprotective effects. In conclusion, mucoadhesive chitosan-coated SLNs offer a promising nasal delivery system overcoming brain drug delivery obstacles facing CBX therapy in PD, paving the way to the development of novel treatments and improved quality of life for PD patients.

Abstract: Purpose
This study aims to investigate the early change in cortical thickness and surface area in early-stage depressed PD (dPD) patients, and its associations with severity of depression.
Methods
59 patients with dPD, 27 patients with non-depressed PD (ndPD), and 43 healthy controls (HC) were recruited. The dPD patients were subclassified into mild-depressed PD (mi-dPD, n = 24), moderate-depressed PD (mo-dPD, n = 21) and severe-depressed PD (se-dPD, n = 14) subgroups. Structural MRI and surface-based morphometry analysis were applied to compare differences in cortical thickness and surface area among groups, and their correlations with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were analyzed.
Results
Compared with ndPD, dPD exhibited cortical thinning in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, mainly involving the left superior frontal and bilateral middle frontal gyri), the right pars opercularis and bilateral lateral occipital gyri. The mean cortical thickness values within these regions negatively correlated with BDI scores. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with mi-dPD had cortical thinning only in the right middle frontal gyrus, while se-dPD showed cortical thinning more extensively involving the right fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and pars opercularis. There was no significant change in cortical surface area in either the dPD or its subgroups.
Conclusion
Our findings indicated that PD-related depression was associated with decrease of cortical thickness, instead of surface area, of which the patterns correlated with the severity of depression. Cortical thinning in dlPFC, mainly involving the left middle frontal gyrus, may serve as a potential neuroimaging indicator for early recognition of depression in PD patients.

Abstract: Introduction
Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, as an add-on therapy to levodopa, are widely used in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The effects of MAO-B inhibitors on quality of life remain unclear, and the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of MAO-B inhibitors on quality of life in different domains.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Embass, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials of PD patients who were administered MAO-B inhibitors. Outcomes were the change from baseline in the total score of life quality scales, change from baseline in domains of the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and incidence of treatment-associated adverse events (TAEs).
Results
Sixteen studies covering 4734 PD patients were included in the study. The PDQ-39 scores were lower with MAO-B inhibitors than with placebo (SMD: −0.26, 95 % CI: [−0.49, −0.04], P = 0.02). The European Quality of Life Questionnaire-5D (EQ-5D) scores were higher in the MAO-B inhibitor group. Patients treated with MAO-B inhibitors had better performance in the domains of mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, communication, and bodily discomfort, except for social support and cognition. The incidence of TAEs was slightly higher in patients treated with MAO-B inhibitors.
Conclusions
Evidence has shown that MAO-B inhibitors, especially safinamide, are effective in improving the quality of life of PD patients, although with a slightly higher incidence of TAEs. The domains of quality of life were improved, except for cognition and social support, compared with placebo. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of other MAO-B inhibitors on quality of life.

Abstract: Effective programming of calcium ion (Ca2+) is critical and challenging for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy due to the requirement of both the promotion of Ca2+ influx to activate lysosomal autophagy pathway and the reduction of Ca2+ level for inhibiting neuroinflammation. Herein, an engineering ginger-extracellular vesicles (CQGE) with a programmed Ca2+ regulation is designed to dynamically balance the contradiction between autophagy and anti-inflammation according to the varied stage in PD therapy. Specifically, the ginger-derived extracellular vesicles (GEVs) with high content of 6-shogaol were fused with the targeted nanomicelles (CQ) containing quercetin to develop CQGE. The weak hydrophilic of 6-shogaol priority facilitated its rapid extracellular release to stimulate Ca2+ influx, thereby activating lysosomal autophagy pathway (CaMKK2/AMPK/mTOR) for the degradation of α-synuclein aggregation. Subsequently, the strong hydrophobic of quercetin then released slowly in the neurons, leading to sustained reduction in Ca2+ level by chelation to inhibit neuroinflammation and promote the repair of neurons. Such a programmable Ca2+ nanomodulator exhibited a promising therapeutic strategy on the enhancement sequentially of the neuronal autophagy, degradation of α-synuclein and anti-inflammatory, implementing the behavioral improvements and neural functional recovery in PD model mice.

Abstract: PD is one of the neurodegenerative illnesses affects 1–2 individuals per 1000 people over the age of 60 and has a 1 % prevalence rate. It affects both the non-motor and motor aspects of movement, including initiation, execution, and planning. Prior to behavioral and cognitive abnormalities like dementia, movement-related symptoms including stiffness, tremor, and initiation issues may be observed. Patients with PD have substantial reductions in social interactions, quality of life (QoL), and familial ties, as well as significant financial burdens on both the individual and societal levels. The healthcare industry is mostly using ML approaches with the modalities like image, signal, and data as well. Therefore, this survey aims to conduct a review of 50 articles on Parkinson disease diagnosis using different modalities. The survey includes (i) Classifying multimodal articles on Parkinson disease diagnosis (image, signal, data) using various machine learning, deep learning, and other approaches. (ii) Analyzing different datasets, simulation tools used in the existing papers. (iii)Examining certain performance measures, assessing the best performance, and chronological review of reviewed paper. Finally, the review determines the research gaps and obstacles in this research topic.

Abstract: Background
Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a nonselective calcium-permeable cation channel. Our previous study revealed that TRPV4 mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inflammation, leading to the loss of dopamine neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson’s disease (PD) model mice.
Objective
The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular role of TRPV4 in ferroptosis in PD models.
Methods
We used GSK2193874 (an inhibitor of TRPV4) and siRNA targeting TRPV4 to explore the role of TRPV4 in iron transportation, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+)-treated PC12 cells by H2DCFDA, CCK-8, ELISA and western blot. In a PD mouse model, the intracerebral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) was used to knockdown or upregulate TRPV4 expression following the intraperitoneal injection of MPTP and GSK2193874. We used Perl’s iron staining and western blot to detect alterations in iron-positive cells and ferroptosis-associated molecules in the substantia nigra (SN).
Results
We found that silencing TRPV4 increased the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), decreased divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), and alleviated the excessive ROS and oxidative stress in MPP+-induced PC12 cells. Moreover, TRPV4 regulated the accumulation of iron in the SN and ferroptosis-associated signalling pathways in PD mice.
Conclusions
TRPV4 plays a key role in MPP+/MPTP-induced ferroptosis. Our results indicate that the downregulation of TRPV4 may a represent promising treatment for PD through the inhibition of ferroptosis.

Abstract: Introduction
Indian Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients are severely underrepresented in terms of genetic studies and little is known about the frequency of variants and their impact on motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMS).
Methods
This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in PD patients undergoing treatment at a tertiary care hospital from India. Patients were advised genetic testing if they had (i) age at onset (AAO) of motor symptoms at or before 50 years (EOPD), (ii) positive family history of PD, parkinsonism or dystonia. All patients underwent whole exome sequencing and potentially pathogenic variants were identified.
Results
Clinical and genetic data were available for 230 (163 males, 70.4 %) patients. Thirty-five pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in various PD genes were identified in 47 patients resulting in a yield of 20.4 %. In the remaining, 82 patients had either variants of uncertain significance or had variants in genes not associated with parkinsonism and 101 patients did not have any non-benign variants. Patients with genetically mediated PD had a lower AAO and statistically greater frequency of dystonia (36.2 %), postural instability (29.8 %) and mood disorder (29.8 %) and a higher Hoehn and Yahr score (2.9). Among the 47 patients, 11 patients had PARK-PRKN, six patients had PARK-PLA2G6, and 22 patients had PARK-GBA1.
Conclusion
Around one-fifth of early-onset PD can have an underlying monogenetic cause. PARK-GBA1, PARK-PRKN and PARK-PLA2G6 are the commoner causes of genetically mediated PD in India. Patients with genetic cause had an earlier age at onset, and more frequent dystonia, postural instability and dyskinesia.

Abstract: Introduction
Recombinant alleles are responsible for a large part of Gaucher disease (GD) causing alterations. This is because GBA1, the gene involved in GD, has a 96 % homologous pseudogene, GBAP1, at a 1.6kb distance. GBA1 gene variants are also the most common molecular alteration among Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients, even in heterozygosity. The most common GD causing recombinant allele is RecNciI (which comprises three single nucleotide variants: p.L483P, p.A495P and p.Val499=). Every time this GBA1 recombinant allele is formed by an unequal crossing over event, another allele is formed with a copy number gain, i.e., a triplicate copy where GBA1 and GBAP1 are preserved, and a third intermediate copy is formed with its sequence starting at GBAP1 and then reverting to GBA1 after the recombination point (called here TRIP-SV).
Methods
Two cohorts were screened for the mid part of the TRIP-SV in PD patients using a specific amplification method. One cohort was formed by 65 early onset PD patients and the other with 100 idiopathic PD patients.
Results
In each cohort one patient carrying the TRIP-SV was detected. Sanger sequencing confirmed the expected sequence of the TRIP-SV.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that it is mandatory that groups analyzing the GBA1 gene searching for molecular causation of PD investigate the presence of this SV encompassing the GBA1/GBAP1 region, which pathogenicity deserves further studies.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Cognitive impairment often occurs early in the disease and can persist throughout its progression, severely impacting patients’ quality of life. The utilization of machine learning (ML) has recently shown promise in identifying cognitive impairment in patients with PD.
Objective
This study aims to summarize different ML models applied to cognitive impairment in patients with PD and to identify determinants for improving diagnosis and predictive power for early detection of cognitive impairment.
Methods
PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles on March 2, 2024. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Bivariate meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity results, presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. A summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve was used.
Results
A total of 38 articles met the criteria, involving 8564 patients with PD and 1134 healthy controls. Overall, 120 models reported sensitivity and specificity, with mean values of 71.07% (SD 13.72%) and 77.01% (SD 14.31%), respectively. Predictors commonly used in ML models included clinical features, neuroimaging features, and other variables. No significant heterogeneity was observed in the bivariate meta-analysis, which included 12 studies. Using sensitivity as the metric, the combined sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 (95% CI 0.67-0.83) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.88), respectively. When specificity was used, the combined values were 0.77 (95% CI 0.65-0.86) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.63-0.85), respectively. The area under the curves of the SROC were 0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.89) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.80-0.86) respectively.
Conclusions
Our findings provide a comprehensive summary of various ML models and demonstrate the effectiveness of ML as a tool for diagnosing and predicting cognitive impairment in patients with PD.

Abstract: Apitherapy has a long history in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) in humans, with evidence suggesting that bee venom (BV) can mitigate Parkinson's symptoms. Central to BV's effects is melittin (MLT), a principal peptide whose neuroprotective mechanisms in PD are not fully understood. The study investigated the effects of MLT on an experimental PD model in mice and dopaminergic neuron cells, induced by MPTP or MPP+. We concentrate on the autophagic response elicited by MLT during PD pathogenesis. The findings showed that MLT was shown to protect against MPP+/MPTP cytotoxicity and preserve tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels, indicating neuronal safeguarding. Remarkably, MLT instigated mitophagy, enhancing mitochondrial homeostasis in MPP+-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. Further, MLT's promotion of mitophagy was confirmed to be AMPK/mTOR signaling-dependent. Validation using Bafilomycin A1, an autophagy inhibitor, confirmed MLT's neuroprotective role, with autophagy inhibition negating MLT's benefits and reducing TH preservation. These findings illuminate MLT's therapeutic potential, particularly its modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathology. Our research advances the understanding of MLT's mechanistic action, emphasizing its role in mitochondrial autophagy and AMPK/mTOR signaling, offering a novel perspective beyond the symptomatic relief associated with BV.

Abstract: L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating motor complication that develops following prolonged L-DOPA therapy in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Aberrant activation of dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) signaling in D1-type/direct pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of LID. We previously characterized DRD1 signaling in seven striatal subregions and found that upregulation of DRD1 signaling in the intermediate/caudal part (IC) is associated with LID in a mouse model of PD. Here, we investigated whether DRD1 expression in the IC plays a causal role in LID development. Using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a short hairpin RNA against Drd1 (AAV-shDrd1), we selectively knocked down DRD1 expression in the IC of male mice. In unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned mice, DRD1 knockdown in the IC significantly attenuated LID after acute and chronic L-DOPA treatment. In contrast, knockdown in either the rostral or intermediate/rostral part, previously identified as the LID-unrelated subregion, did not affect LID. These findings highlight the essential role of DRD1 and its signaling in the IC in LID development, providing valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic approaches.

Abstract: The link between Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) dates back to the early 1960s, and ongoing research is exploring this association. PD is linked to dysregulation of dopaminergic pathways, neuroinflammation, decreased PPAR-γ coactivator 1-α, increased phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes, and accelerated α-Syn amyloid fibril production caused by T2DM. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the T2DM-PD association and risk factors for PD in T2DM individuals. The study reviews existing literature using reputable sources like Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed, revealing a significant association between T2DM and worsened PD symptoms. Genetic profiles of T2DM-PD individuals show similarities, and potential risk factors include insulin-resistance and dysbiosis of the gut-brain microbiome. Anti-diabetic drugs exhibit neuroprotective effects in PD, and nanoscale delivery systems like exosomes, micelles, and liposomes show promise in enhancing drug efficacy by crossing the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB). Brain targeting for PD uses exosomes, micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, solid lipid nanoparticles, nano-sized polymers, and niosomes to improve medication and gene therapy efficacy. Surface modification of nanocarriers with bioactive compounds (such as angiopep, lactoferrin, and OX26) enhances α-Syn conjugation and BBB permeability. Natural exosomes, though limited, hold potential for investigating DM-PD pathways in clinical research. The study delves into the underlying mechanisms of T2DM and PD and explores current therapeutic approaches in the field of nano-based targeted drug delivery. Emphasis is placed on resolved and ongoing issues in understanding and managing both conditions.

Abstract: The interplay between Parkinson’s disease (PD) and sleep disturbances suggests that sleep problems constitute a risk factor for PD progression, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Microglial activation and oxidative stress are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that sleep deprivation (SD) could exacerbate PD progression via modulating microglial activation and oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis, we established a PD mouse model using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), then subjected the mice to SD. A battery of behavioral tests, including rotarod, pole, adhesive removal, and open field tests, were used to assess motor function. Our study showed that SD exacerbated motor deficits, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), microglial activation and oxidative stress damage in PD model mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments revealed that SD mediated PD progression, microglial activation and oxidative stress via the gut microbiota. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that SD increased the abundances of bacteria such as Bacteroidaceae, while decreasing the abundances of bacteria including Lactobacillus. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis of gut microbiota-derived metabolites revealed that SD significantly increased the production of adenosine (ADO), a purine metabolite. Probiotic supplementation reversed the effects of SD on motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, microglial activation and oxidative stress damage in PD mice; it also decreased SD-induced ADO production. Administration of Adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) inhibitors, Istradefylline (Ist), attenuated the roles of SD and ADO in promoting microglial activation, oxidative stress and PD progression. Taken together, our findings indicate that SD accelerates PD progression via regulating microbiota associated microglial activation and oxidative stress, suggesting that efforts to improve sleep quality can be used to prevent and treat PD.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) nurses constitute a reliable modality for appraising the motor status of patients, second only to expert neurologists. Consequently, employing PD nurses for the assessment of medical device performance is appreciated to be a fundamental benchmark in the field.
Objective
To evaluate the precision of a telemonitoring device in measuring motor symptoms when utilized at patient’s home during everyday life conditions.
Methods
To ascertain the extent of correlation between device-reported outcomes and PD nurse assessments and the precision with which the device detects symptoms such as gait impairment, rest tremor, bradykinesia, and the presence of OFF, a total of 34 evaluations were conducted by a PD nurse at the patients’ home, each lasting 3 h.
Results
A robust correlation was noted for all three symptoms when analyzed at both 30-minute intervals and cumulatively over the entire 3-hour duration with Pearson’s r range 0.68–0.76 and 0.83–0.90 respectively. Furthermore, substantial agreement was observed for the identification of the presence of all three symptoms with Cohen’s kappa range from 0.61 to 0.71 across all 30-minute evaluations. Finally, the device demonstrates high accuracy in detecting rest tremor (90%), bradykinesia (89%), gait impairment (95%) and OFF state (94%).
Conclusion
This study evaluates for the first time the performance of a remote monitoring device, unobtrusively, at patients familiar environment, with a PD nurse present in non-scripted scenarios. The device exhibited commendable efficacy in the accurate detection of PD symptoms and state.

Abstract: Background
Patients diagnosed with Parkinson Disease (PD) may experience sensory-perceptual-motor deficits. Therefore, approaches that induce changes in neuroplasticity and function, such as motor imagery (MI) and action observation (AO), may prove advantageous.
Objective
To describe the effects of MI and AO combined with physiotherapy on functional capacity in four patients with PD.
Methods
A case series with a repeated-measures design was conducted, with a sample size of four. The patients (P1 to P4) were aged between 67 and 85 years and exhibited mild to moderate PD. The functional capacity was evaluated using the Five Times Sit-To-Stand (5TSTS), Two Minute Step Test (TMST), Single-Leg-Stance, Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Timed Up and Go – Dual Task, at three moments: pre-intervention (m1), following a four-week period of physiotherapy (m2) and after a period of combining of physiotherapy sessions with MI and AO (m3).
Results
Following m3, all patients improved in TUG, TUG-Manual (TUG-M), and TUG-Cognitive (TUG-C). P1, P3 and P4 enhanced in 5TSTS, while P1 and P3 increased in TMST. Conversely, P2 and P3 refined after m2, in 5TSTS, TUG-M and TUG-C.
Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that combining a MI with AO program to physiotherapy had different repercussions on functional capacity in individuals with PD.

Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is well-recognized as an established technique for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) treatment. Highlighting its technological advancements in DBS, this paper emphasizes the importance of developing new technologies for adaptive DBS, such as the capability for reading and interpreting Local Field Potentials (LFPs) and implementing self-regulating models for the electrical discharge of DBS. The article focuses on the development of an adaptive computational model for addressing this issue using the technique of DBS in combination with reinforcement learning (RL) strategies and the modeling of neurons using the Izhikevich model. The central objective is to optimize therapeutic outcomes, potentially transforming the treatment paradigm for patients with Parkinson’s. This study stands out for its personalized approach to treatment, using the proposed methodology that dynamically adjusts stimulation parameters in response to the patient’s variable conditions. Subsequently, performance analysis was carried out to minimize the symptoms with better energy efficiency.

Abstract: Objective
This study aims to investigate the diagnostic value of multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizing arterial spin labeling (ASL), quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and 3D T1-weighted imaging (3DT1WI) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, it evaluates the relationship between MRI findings and non-motor symptoms associated with PD.
Methods
ASL, QSM, and 3DT1WI scans were performed on 48 PD patients and 46 healthy controls (HC). We extracted and analyzed differences in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), magnetic susceptibility, and gray matter density parameters between the two groups. These MRI parameters were correlated with clinical scale scores assessing non-motor symptoms, including cognitive function, sleep quality, olfaction, autonomic function, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each imaging modality in distinguishing PD from HC.
Results
The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for rCBF, magnetic susceptibility, and gray matter density were 0.941, 0.979, and 0.624, respectively. In PD patients, a negative correlation was found between Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part II (UPDRS II) scores and rCBF in the bilateral precuneus. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores negatively correlated with rCBF in the left middle temporal gyrus and right middle occipital gyrus. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores positively correlated with QSM values in the right supplementary motor area, while scores on the Argentine Smell Identification Test (AHRS) negatively correlated with QSM values in the same area. Disease duration showed a positive correlation with QSM values in the right middle cingulate gyrus. Additionally, PSQI scores positively correlated with QSM values in the left middle cingulate gyrus, and fatigue severity scale (FSS) scores also positively correlated with QSM values in the left middle cingulate gyrus. Gray matter atrophy in the left inferior temporal gyrus was associated with cognitive impairment in PD.
Conclusion
Occipital hypoperfusion and cortical atrophy in the left inferior temporal gyrus may serve as novel imaging biomarkers for PD and are associated with sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment in PD patients. Extensive iron deposition in the bilateral cerebral cortex of PD patients may be a contributing factor to non-motor symptoms such as sleep disturbances and fatigue. Multimodal imaging techniques, including ASL, QSM, and 3DT1WI, can enhance the diagnostic accuracy for PD.

Abstract: Objective
To systematically evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese exercises (TCEs) for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) in patients with Parkinson’s disease.
Methods
A comprehensive literature search was performed across eight databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science (WoS), SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang Database, covering studies published from their inception up to April 23, 2024. The search focused on identifying randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of TCEs for NPSs in PD patients. The authors independently performed literature screening and data extraction. Meta-analysis was executed employing Review Manager V.5.3 software, and Stata 17.0 was used to detect publication bias and perform sensitivity analysis. GRADEpro GDT was used to grade the certainty of each outcome evidence.
Results
Eighteen studies involving 937 participants were included. The meta-analysis showed significant improvements in depression-related scales (standardized mean difference (SMD) = –1.30, 95 % confidence interval (CI): –2.10 to –0.49, p = 0.002), anxiety-related scales (SMD = –1.11, 95 %CI: –2.14 to –0.08, p = 0.03), sleep disorder-related scales (SMD = –0.71, 95 %CI: –0.99 to –0.43, p < 0.00001), and cognition-related scales (SMD = 0.91, 95 %CI: 0.44–1.38, p = 0.0001). Quality of life also improved (SMD = –1.35, 95 % CI: –2.38 to –0.31, p = 0.01; SMD = 0.99, 95 % CI: 0.54–1.43, p < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses grounded in the duration of the intervention suggested that interventions lasting up to 12 weeks showed more significant anti-depression and anti-anxiety effects while those lasting beyond 12 weeks demonstrated greater improvements in sleep quality and cognitive function. Additionally, subgroup analyses based on the type of intervention revealed that both using TCEs alone and the combination of TCEs with conventional medications showed greater effects on anti-depression and cognitive function, while the latter yield more significant anti-anxiety effects. However, no statistical significance was found for fatigue-related scales. The clinical trials included in this review also lacked a thorough description of the randomization process, and only a small proportion reported adequate allocation concealment procedures, raising concerns about potential selection bias. Moreover, owing to the inherent characteristics of TCEs, blinding both participants and practitioners is challenging, which may result in performance bias. Additionally, the absence of blinding could allow assessors’ subjective influences to affect the outcomes, leading to detection bias. The overall quality of the evidence, as assessed according to the GRADE criteria, was rated as very low or low for most of outcomes.
Conclusions
The findings indicated that the use of TCEs may have potential to alleviate the severity of NPSs including depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and enhance cognition function and overall quality of life in PD patients. Nevertheless, given the limited number of studies and their methodologic issues such as the absence of blinding, along with the small sample sizes, significant heterogeneity across these primary studies, careful interpretation of the results is warranted. More high-quality research with larger sample sizes, including double-blind studies or those employing an active control group involving exercises such as walking, ought to be carried out to validate the above findings and strengthen the evidence base.

Abstract: Protein dyshomeostasis is identified as the hallmark of many age-related NDDs including Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder (NDD) characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, particularly α-synuclein (α-syn) leading to formation of Lewy bodies and cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Disruption of the cell's normal protein balance, which occurs when cells experience stress, plays a key role in causing the formation of harmful protein clumps. Functional proteostasis relies on coordinated mechanisms involving posttranslational modifications (PTMs), molecular chaperones, the unfolded protein response (UPR), the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP). These networks maintain proper synthesis, folding, confirmation and degradation of protein such as α-syn protein in PD. These approaches include enhancing lysosomal function, promoting autophagy and modulating the unfolded protein response. Understanding the complex interactions between these pathways is essential for developing effective treatments. This review synthesizes current knowledge of various genes and molecular mechanisms underlying proteostasis disruption in PD and evaluates emerging therapeutic strategies that target multiple genes and pathways simultaneously. The finding highlights the potential of integrated approaches to restore protein homeostasis and prevent neurodegeneration, offering new directions for PD treatment development.

Abstract: Ethnopharmacological relevance
Gastrodia elata Blume (GEB), a herbaceous plant from the Orchidaceae family, is the core ingredient of the classic traditional Chinese medicine formula Tianma Gouteng Yin. Its dried tubers have been used in medicine since ancient times, with records dating back to the "Shennong Bencao Jing," and are commonly employed in the treatment of limb numbness and convulsions, boasting a medicinal history of over 1800 years. However, no studies have yet focused on the changes in differential metabolites in the striatum after GEB treatment.
Aim of the study
This study aimed to evaluate the protective effects of GEB on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in mice and to explore its potential mechanisms.
Materials and methods
Mice were randomly divided into a control group, a model group, and GEB treatment groups (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg). After 14 days of GEB pretreatment, a sub-acute PD model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of MPTP (30 mg/kg) once daily for 7 consecutive days. The potential of GEB to improve motor behavior in PD mice was evaluated using gait analysis (GA) and the pole test. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in the striatum of PD mice. The effects of GEB on substantia nigra damage were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) and immunohistochemistry. Lastly, the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of GEB on MPTP-induced PD mice through striatal metabolomics analysis were investigated.
Results
A total of 402 compounds were identified in the GEB ethanol extract, with gastrodin, parishins A, B, C, and E, and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol being the major components. These were quantified by HPLC at 2.47 %, 2.04 %, 1.25 %, 0.33 %, 1.14 %, and 2.88 %, respectively. GEB improved the propulsive index and duty cycle of the gait index, reduced climbing time, and inhibited the elevation of inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the striatum. GEB ameliorated neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta and alleviated motor impairments in PD model mice. Furthermore, striatal metabolomics analysis showed that GEB treatment improved various metabolic pathways, including glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, tyrosine, arachidonic acid, and arginine and proline.
Conclusions
GEB extract demonstrated positive ameliorative effects on PD by inhibiting inflammatory responses, ameliorating neuronal damage, and modulating lipid metabolic pathways, and possibly being an ideal candidate for the development of functional foods for PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and associated motor symptoms. Recent studies suggest a strong link between circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) and PD pathogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of CRD on PD progression using a 6-hydroxydopamine induced experimental PD model in mice. CRD was induced using a chronic jet lag protocol and mice were divided into four main groups as Sham, CRD, PD and PD + CRD. Behavioral assessments, immunofluorescence staining, and proteomic analyses were performed to evaluate functional and molecular changes. Non-lesional CRD groups have shown that CRD can cause molecular changes that may sensitise neural tissue to degeneration. CRD significantly worsened motor asymmetry, reduced locomotor activity PD mice. Neuropathological analysis revealed a marked reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+) dopaminergic neurons in the SN and decreased TH fiber density in the striatum, indicating enhanced neurodegeneration. Proteomic analysis identified 427 differentially expressed proteins in the SN and 115 in the striatum, with key alterations in pathways related to mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, dopaminergic signaling, proteasome-mediated protein degradation, and ferroptosis. Notably, proteins involved in cytoskeletal stability (MARK1, Septin3), neuroinflammation (JAK2, Ifi208), and metabolic regulation (PDE4A, ACSL3) exhibited significant changes in CRD-exposed PD mice. These findings highlight the critical role of circadian dysfunction in accelerating PD progression by exacerbating neuronal loss and dysregulating key molecular pathways. Targeting circadian homeostasis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for mitigating neurodegeneration in PD.

Abstract: With advances in genetic testing increasing proportion of early onset Parkinson disease (EOPD) are being identified to have an underlying genetic aetiology. This is can be in the form of either highly penetrant genes associated with phenotypes with monogenic or mendelian inheritance patterns or those genes known as risk factor genes which confer an increased risk of PD in an individual. Both of them can modify the phenotypic manifestation in a patient with PD. This improved knowledge has helped in deciphering the intricate role of various cellular pathways in the pathophysiology of PD including both early and late and even sporadic PD. However, the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity is a major challenge. Different deleterious alterations in a same gene can result in a spectrum of presentation spanning from juvenile to late onset and typical to atypical parkinsonism manifestation. Similarly, a single phenotype can occur due to abnormality in two or more different genes. This conundrum poses a dilemma in the clinical approach and in understanding the clinico-genetic correlation. Understanding the clinico-genetic correlation carries even more importance especially when genetic testing is either not accessible or affordable or in many regions both. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss briefly the approach to various PARK gene related EOPD and describe in detail the clinico-genetic correlation of individual type of PARK gene related genetic EOPD with respect to their classical clinical presentation, pathophysiology, investigation findings and treatment response to medication and surgery.

Abstract: Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly affecting patients' quality of life and posing challenges for clinical management. Early prediction of cognitive decline in PD is critical for timely diagnosis and intervention. However, the interplay of multivariate factors such as age, gender, and disease duration complicate early prediction. To address the multifactorial nature of cognitive impairment in PD, this study proposes a neuroscience-informed nomogram model constructed using multivariate logistic regression. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was applied to identify highly correlated clinical variables influencing cognitive function. Subsequently, these variables were integrated into a visualized nomogram model to facilitate early prediction of cognitive impairment (CI) risk. Performance evaluation of the model demonstrated high accuracy, consistency, and clinical applicability, significantly enhancing diagnostic efficiency for neurologists. Furthermore, the model provides visual comparisons of patient distributions across different predictor values, enabling personalized risk assessments. According to experimental analysis and verification, the model demonstrated outstanding prediction with a region under the ROC curve of 0.872 on the original training set and 0.870 on the validation set. Because the anticipated and observed probabilities were so consistent, the model was able to forecast the patient's likelihood of cognitive impairment.

Abstract: Degeneration of the nigrostriatal system occurs in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) via distinct pathological mechanisms. Here, we investigated nigrostriatal degeneration in MSA and PD by combining a newly developed method for evaluating the regional accumulation of dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT SPECT) and individual voxel-based morphometry adjusting covariates (iVAC). We recruited 17 MSA patients and 13 PD patients, and compared their clinical and imaging indices. All patients underwent DAT SPECT and head three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We calculated the specific binding ratio (SBR) of the putamen and caudate separately using a region-based method, and evaluated the association between the SBR and iVAC Z-score. SBR values of the putamen and caudate were lower in the PD group than in the MSA group (p < 0.001 for both). The MSA and PD groups had lower SBR values in the putamen than in the caudate (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). We found a negative correlation between the putamen SBR and iVAC Z-score in MSA (p < 0.001, r = −0.775), but such a correlation was not detected in PD. For the caudate, there was no correlation between the SBR and iVAC Z-score in MSA and PD. Our results indicate different mechanisms of reduced uptake of DATs in MSA and PD. The association between the striatal SBR and iVAC Z-score suggests parallel degeneration in the substantia nigra and striatum in MSA.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with complex motor and nonmotor symptoms. To assess these, clinical assessments are completed, providing a snapshot of a person’s experience. Monitoring Parkinson disease using wearable devices can provide continuous and objective data and capture information on movement patterns in daily life.
Objective
The aim of the study is to assess patient acceptability and technical reliability of 2 wearable devices used in clinical trials (ActivInsights and Axivity AX3).
Methods
Participants in a feasibility study testing a self-management toolkit (PD-Care) optionally wore a wearable device for 1 week, providing feedback through an open- and closed-question survey conducted over the telephone about the acceptability of wearing the device. The closed questions used a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (with 1=strongly agree and 5=strongly disagree) asking whether (1) the device was comfortable to wear, (2) the device was easy to put on, (3) the device was easy to wear, (4) the device was embarrassing to wear, and (5) if they were happy to wear the device for longer than 7 days. Differences in acceptability between devices were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests and Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank tests. These were followed by open-ended questions asking (1) How did you find wearing the device? (2) How did you find putting the device on? (3) Did you take it off and why? (4) What was your overall impression? (5) Did you prefer the wrist- or trunk-worn device and why (Axivity AX3 only)?
Results
A total of 22 of 32 (69%) participants offered the device agreed to wear it. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics between those monitored and those who chose not to be. Acceptance with both devices was generally good. The ActivInsights device was more acceptable than the wrist- and trunk-worn Axivity AX3 devices, as more participants found it to be comfortable (n=15, 100% vs n=5, 71%; P=.02 and n=4, 57%; P=.004, respectively), easy to wear (n=15, 100% vs n=6, 86%; P=.048 and n=3, 43%; P=.004, respectively) and would wear for more than 7 days (n=13, 87% vs n=4, 57%; P=.02 and n=1, 14%; P<.001, respectively). The trunk-worn Axivity AX3 device had the lowest acceptance rates, but there were no statistical differences in acceptability between the wrist- and trunk-worn Axivity AX3 devices (all P>.05). There were issues with battery life and recording errors in 3 of 14 (21%) Axivity AX3 devices and upload failures in 3 of 15 (20%) ActivInsights devices.
Conclusions
Acceptability of wearables for monitoring Parkinson was satisfactory, especially when wrist-worn, although a few participants experienced difficulties in correct use, and there were some errors with the data upload.

Abstract: Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial-associated RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a key role in RNA stability and translation, which have also been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). TRIM71, RING E3 Ligase, is known for its RNA-binding ability and transient interactions with mitochondrial surface. However miRNA binding and resulting effects on mitochondrial function and apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons, and their implications in PD pathogenesis have not yet been investigated. Here, we identified that TRIM71 binds to several miRNAs including miR-30b-5p on mitochondria of SH-SY5Y cells. The expression of miR-30b-5p is significantly increased in the presence of rotenone and reduced in the presence of 6-OHDA. The predicted gene targets of miR-30b-5p show specific networks involved in mitochondrial functions and apoptosis, including CASP3, BCL2, and BCL2L11, prominently associated with PD. The expression of miR-30b-5p decreased Caspase-3 levels in PD stress conditions, validating CASP3 as target mRNA. The expression of miR-30b-5p improved mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity under PD stress conditions. miR-30b-5p also enhanced the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as well as the glycolytic capacity and reserve PD stress conditions. Furthermore, the co-expression of miR-30b-5p with TRIM71 rescued TRIM71-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis, indicating a neuroprotective role. Together, these findings highlight that TRIM71-bound miR-30b-5p enhances mitochondrial function and attenuates apoptosis in PD stress conditions.

Abstract: Background
Specific Virtual Reality (VR) systems designed for rehabilitation and non-specific VR systems intended for entertainment are used in Parkinson's disease (PD) rehabilitation, but their effects are unclear. The extent to which these systems integrate neurorehabilitation principles for PD rehabilitation is unknown. Previous meta-analyses exist but data are lacking on the impact of VR on mobility.
Objectives
Primary aim: to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis comparing the effects of VR and conventional therapy (CT) on balance and mobility in people with PD. Secondary aim: to perform subgroup analyses on VR type, disease severity, and treatment duration.
Methods
Randomized controlled trials comparing VR and CT effects on balance and mobility in adults with PD were selected from Pubmed and EMBASE until September 2024. Data were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively using a standardized mean difference (SMD) with random-effects model. Subgroup analyses (VR type, disease severity, and treatment duration) and analysis of fulfilled neurorehabilitation principles were conducted. Risk of bias was assessed (PEDro checklist and Cochrane RoB-2).
Results
Twenty-eight studies (12 countries) were included: 1151 participants, mean Hoehn & Yahr stage between 1.4 and 3.4, mean (SD) treatment duration 18.8 (11.5) hours in the qualitative analysis and 23 in the quantitative analysis. Overall risk of bias was high (10 studies), some concerns (13 studies), or low (5 studies). VR was more effective than CT for balance (630 participants; 11 studies; SMD 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19–0.65; P < 0.001) and as effective as CT for mobility (591 participants; 10 studies; SMD 0.18; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.40; P = 0.09). Balance and mobility outcomes did not differ between specific and non-specific VR. Subgroup analyses found no significant differences.
Conclusions
VR improved balance in people with PD more than CT (low-certainty evidence). VR improved mobility similarly to CT (moderate-certainty evidence). VR games should integrate neurorehabilitation principles.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the motor system, with symptoms including tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Affecting over six million people globally, PD’s pathophysiology is marked by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management, yet current methods are limited by low sensitivity, high cost, and the need for advanced equipment. Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as promising tools for early PD diagnosis, converting biological reactions into measurable electrical signals for evaluating PD biomarkers. Advances in nanotechnology and material science have led to innovative sensing platforms with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity. Key biomarkers such as alpha-synuclein (α-syn), dopamine (DA), and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been targeted using these biosensors. For instance, gold nanoparticle-modified graphene immunosensors have shown ultra-sensitive detection of α-syn, while graphene-based biosensors have demonstrated high sensitivity for DA detection. Additionally, nanobiosensors for miR-195 and electrochemical aptasensors have shown potential for early PD diagnosis. The integration of nanomaterials like gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes has further advanced the field, enhancing electrochemical activity and sensitivity. These developments offer a reliable, rapid, and cost-effective approach for early PD diagnosis, paving the way for better management and treatment. Continued research is essential for the commercialization and clinical integration of these biosensors, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Introduction
Evidence have indicated relation between apolipoproteins and neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). However, previous studies have produced inconsistent results, and a comprehensive analysis of apolipoproteins in NDDs is currently lacking.
Methods
Using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis based on data from UK Biobank, we examined the association between baseline serum levels of apolipoprotein A (ApoA) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multiple sclerosis.
Results
Elevated baseline levels of serum ApoA (HR = 0.84, 95 % CI: 0.71–0.99, P = 0.047) and ApoB (HR = 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.57–0.78, P = 3.18E-07) were associated with a reduced risk of incident PD. Subgroup analyses suggested the protective effect of serum ApoA was more significant for older participants and those with lower alcohol consumption, while higher serum ApoB was a more significant protective factor in males and those without stroke. No significant associations were found between apolipoproteins and other NDDs.
Conclusion
Increased baseline levels of serum ApoA and ApoB are linked to a lower risk of PD. These findings enhance understanding of the role of apolipoproteins in PD, and have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies in clinical trials.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, and inflammation is a key factor in the progression of PD. S100A9 mediates pyroptosis and implicates in various diseases including PD. Pyroptosis, an emerging form of programmed cell death, usually causes cell rupture and death via an inflammatory response. α-Lipoic acid (α-ALA), a cellular coenzyme, participates in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant processes. Although its role in PD has been confirmed, but the exact mechanism of its anti-inflammatory effect remains unclear. In our research, we examined the potential mechanisms of pyroptosis mediated by S100A9 in PD and the neuroprotective effects of α-ALA. We used 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to induce SH-SY5Y cells in vitro and in C57BL/6 mice in vivo. The cell viability of SH-SY5Y cells confirmed the neuroprotective effect of α-ALA. Proteomics analysis indicated that S100A9 was involved in 6-OHDA-mediated neuronal injury, while α-ALA could inhibit. We found that α-ALA ameliorated PD symptoms induced by 6-OHDA and decreased the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome, Gasdermin D, and IL-1β, which are major hallmarks of pyroptosis. Furthermore, our research demonstrated that α-ALA mitigated cell injury by suppressing NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis mediated by S100A9. In brief, pyroptosis is pivotal in PD, while α-ALA protects dopaminergic neurons by suppressing pyroptosis mediated through the NLRP3 inflammasome, directly reducing S100A9, and subsequently inhibiting the NLRP3/Gasdermin D signaling pathways. Our results collectively suggest that suppressing S100A9-mediated pyroptosis and administering α-ALA may represent a novel approach in treating of PD.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's patients have significant autonomic dysfunction, early detect the disorder is a major challenge. To assess the autonomic function in the rat model of rotenone induced Parkinson's disease (PD), Blood pressure and ECG signal acquisition are very important.
New method
We used telemetry to record the electrocardiogram and blood pressure signals from awake rats, with linear and nonlinear analysis techniques calculate the heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV). we applied nonlinear analysis methods like sample entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis to analyze blood pressure signals. Particularly, this is the first attempt to apply nonlinear analysis to the blood pressure evaluate in rotenone induced PD model rat.
Results
HRV in the time and frequency domains indicated sympathetic-parasympathetic imbalance in PD model rats. Linear BPV analysis didn’t reflect changes in vascular function and blood pressure regulation in PD model rats. Nonlinear analysis revealed differences in BPV, with lower sample entropy results and increased detrended fluctuation analysis results in the PD group rats. Comparison with existing methods and Conclusions: our experiments demonstrate the ability to evaluate autonomic dysfunction in models of Parkinson's disease by combining the analysis of BPV with HRV, consistent with autonomic impairment in PD patients. Nonlinear analysis by blood pressure signal may help in early detection of the PD. It indicates that the fluctuation of blood pressure in the rats in the rotenone model group tends to be regular and predictable, contributes to understand the PD pathophysiological mechanisms and to find strategies for early diagnosis.

Abstract: Background
The resting-state cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and tremor-dominant (TD) subtype have been explored. However, the underlying molecular architecture correlated with the altered CBF remains unknown.
Methods
In total, 90 PD patients including 41 TD subtype, and 90 healthy controls (HC) underwent arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance image. The altered CBF were derived by a voxel-wised two sample t-test compare and spatial correlated with serotonin, dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, opioid, noradrenaline, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, acetylcholine and glutamate neurotransmitter density maps.
Results
Compared to HC, PD patients exhibited decreased CBF in left caudate/putamen, increased CBF in bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Moreover, the CBF of SMA showed a positive correlation with disease severity. The altered CBF in PD patients were significantly associated with spatial distribution of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, dopamine receptor, and noradrenaline transporter. Compared to non-tremor-dominant subtype, the TD subtype exhibited decreased CBF in left calcarine/cuneus, increased CBF in left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus. The altered CBF in the TD subtype were significantly associated with spatial distribution of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, glutamate, and opioid receptors.
Conclusions
Besides dopamine, perfusion alterations in SMA of PD patients were more probably correlated with serotonin and noradrenaline. Perfusion alterations of the TD subtype were related to dopamine, serotonin, other excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and opioid, which may provide novel insights into pathophysiological processes and guide new therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Summary
Loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is preceded by loss of synaptic dopamine (DA) and accumulation of proteinaceous aggregates. Linking these deficits is critical to restoring DA signaling in PD. Using murine and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) models of PD coupled with human postmortem tissue, we show that accumulation of α-syn micro-aggregates impairs metabolic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This leads to decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP/H) and glutathione (GSH) levels, resulting in DA oxidation and decreased total DA levels. We find that α-syn anchors the PPP enzyme G6PD to synaptic vesicles via the α-syn C terminus and that this interaction is lost in PD. Furthermore, G6PD clinical mutations are associated with PD diagnosis, and G6PD deletion phenocopies PD pathology. Finally, we show that restoring NADPH or GSH levels through genetic and pharmacological intervention blocks DA oxidation and rescues steady-state DA levels, identifying G6PD as a pharmacological target against PD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, is projected to see a significant rise in incidence over the next three decades. The precise treatment of PD remains a formidable challenge, prompting ongoing research into early diagnostic methodologies. Network pharmacology, a burgeoning field grounded in systems biology, examines the intricate networks of biological systems to identify critical signal nodes, facilitating the development of multi-target therapeutic molecules. This approach systematically maps the components of Parkinson’s disease, thereby reducing its complexity. In this review, we explore the application of network pharmacology workflows in PD, discuss the techniques employed in this field, and evaluate the current advancements and status of network pharmacology in the context of Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Background
Early identification of the poor prognosis subtype by surrogate markers would be advantageous for selecting treatments for Parkinson’s disease (PD). The aim of the present study was to test whether plasma neurofilament light chain (NF-L), total tau (t-tau), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) can be used as prognostic biomarkers in PD.
Methods
In the present study, both retrospective and prospective studies were performed. Plasma samples at baseline from 81 PD patients were included in the prospective study. Plasma samples at baseline from 60 patients who underwent cognitive assessment were subjected to the hierarchical cluster analysis for a retrospective study.
Results
On the basis of the results of the cluster analysis, patients were classified into three groups: groups (G)1, G2 and G3. Individuals in the G1 cluster, who had an older age at onset and were prone to early progression with dementia, had significantly greater plasma NF-L levels than those in the G3 cluster, who did not present with dementia at an early stage. A Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for age and sex revealed that high NF-L and UCH-L1 levels at baseline predicted the four future milestones (i.e., nursing care, dysphagia, wheelchair use, and repeated falls), and high plasma t-tau at baseline predicted future dysphagia.
Conclusions
Although further studies with a larger number of patients will be required, plasma NF-L may be a useful biomarker for identifying the rapidly progressive subtype of PD, and plasma NF-L and UCH-L1 may serve as biomarkers of overall PD prognosis, whereas plasma t-tau could be a biomarker for future dysphagia in PD.

Abstract: Introduction
Pharmacological control of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is challenging with disease progression. Device-aided therapies help relieve these symptoms but are invasive and require specific management. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells avoid ethical concerns and may prevent immune rejection in autologous transplants. Allogeneic iPS cells are considerably more practical, despite potential concerns regarding tumor formation post-transplantation. The present study aimed to clarify the perceptions and acceptance of patients with PD regarding regenerative medicine, invasive surgical treatments (deep brain stimulation, levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel), and cell transplantation (iPS cells, embryonic stem cells, fetal-derived cells).
Methods
This prospective cross-sectional survey of 102 patients with PD applied a new questionnaire based on a previous survey of the general public’s perception of regenerative medicine.
Results
Cell-based therapies were the most popular choice, with 86.1 % of responders choosing it, mainly due to “improvement in quality of life” (69.1 %), “the possibility of slowing the disease progression” (66.2 %), and “treatment effectiveness” (51.5 %). Among these patients, 47.1 % expected regenerative medicine to become the standard therapy within several years and 82.4 % believed that regenerative medicine was safe. Autologous iPS cells were accepted by 83.8 % of the patients, while 52.5 % accepted allogeneic iPS cells.
Conclusions
Patients had high expectations for the therapeutic effects of cell-based therapies and were optimistic about its early implementation and safety in regenerative medicine, with iPS cells being the most accepted for transplantation. The present findings should be confirmed in a larger cohort, as these findings are based on a limited sample.

Abstract: Introduction
Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating episodic gait disorder that significantly reduces the quality of life (QoL) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Diagnosing and treating FOG remains a major medical challenge. This study aimed to assess the correlation between FOG and both motor and non-motor clinical characteristics in patients with PD.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, 112 patients with PD were divided into two groups using the New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q): one group with FOG (PD-FOG, 53 patients) and one group without FOG (PD-nFOG, 59 patients). The severity of PD and FOG was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hoehn-Yahr (H–Y) staging system, and the NFOG-Q. The study also analyzed non-motor symptoms, including sleep disturbances, cognitive impairments, depression, anxiety, apathy, fatigue, and QoL.
Result
The prevalence of FOG was 47.3%. The PD-FOG group exhibited a longer duration of PD (P = 0.002), a higher H–Y stage indicating PD progression (P = 0.003), and elevated anxiety levels (P = 0.003) compared to the PD-nFOG group. According to binary logistic regression analysis, the higher H–Y stage (P = 0.022), anxiety level (P = 0.005), UPDRS part II (P = 0.001), and part III (P = 0.008) were significant predictors for the occurrence of FOG.
Conclusion
Patients with Parkinson's disease who have a higher Hoehn-Yahr (H–Y) stage, higher UPDRS score, and elevated levels of anxiety are more likely to experience FOG.

Abstract: Background
The critical step in Parkinson’s disease (PD) detection is to categorize symptoms that may overlap with symptoms of other disorders, as PD is a slow-progressing and chronic disease. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automated model to recognize and detect the symptoms of PD at an early stage.
Methods
This two-phase hybrid machine-learning model uses 59 features based on motor and non-motor symptoms. In phase-1, various ML classifiers with the best-optimized hyper-parameters were applied first to motor symptoms and then to non-motor symptoms and evaluated using various performance metrics. Afterward, the topmost features based on both symptoms were selected from the best classifiers chosen during phase-1 classification using explainable models (used as feature selectors). Lastly, these selected topmost features are applied to the neural network (NN) model for phase-2 classification. The two-phase approach was selected for its simplicity and effectiveness, as adding more phases would complicate the analysis without offering additional insights, risking overfitting and longer computational times.
Results
In phase-1, the random forest and extra trees classifiers effectively identified the topmost 22 motor and 11 non-motor features using explainable models. Furthermore, the NN model outperformed in phase-2 classification, achieving 99.40 % accuracy, 99.39 % F1-score, 99.47 % recall, and 99.32 % precision.
Conclusion
The topmost features of motor (constancy of rest tremor, facial, and bradykinesia) and non-motor (constipation, urine, and anxious mood) significantly impact PD diagnosis. These findings align with prior research, reinforcing their relevance in PD diagnosis. Hence, hybrid models can be beneficial to doctors in diagnosing the disease.

Abstract: Background
Of the neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease is recognised to have the fastest growing prevalence. It is unclear whether this is due to the ageing global population alone, with several environmental factors increasingly implicated in changing prevalence rates. Large data sets have been used nationally and globally to help predict future disease burden. However, the reliability of such sources is yet unknown for Parkinson's disease.
Summary
This review discusses the methods used in all published UK prevalence studies conducted to date. Direct comparison between prevalence figures obtained from the 10 to discussed prevalence studies is precluded due to differences in methodology for case ascertainment and diagnosis. Age adjusted estimates vary from 105/100,000 to 168/100,000.
Key messages
These studies demonstrate no overall trend in changing prevalence figures between 1961 and 2007. No difference in prevalence trends were seen for those living in rural or urban areas. Differences between ethnic groups, for example, remains an under explored area.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disorder marked by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of Lewy bodies. Traditionally viewed as primarily a dopaminergic disorder, recent research has highlighted the significant role of neuroinflammation and the complex interplay between glial cells, particularly astrocytes and microglia, in PD pathogenesis. This review explores the multifaceted roles of astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes in PD, focusing on their involvement in maintaining glutamate and ion homeostasis, energy metabolism, and the inflammatory response. We discuss the dual nature of these glial cells, which can both support and harm neuronal health under different conditions. We also examine the molecular mechanisms underlying glial cell communication, including cytokines, chemokines, extracellular vesicles, gap junctions, and neurotransmitter systems. Finally, we propose potential therapeutic strategies targeting these glial interactions to modulate neuroinflammation and protect neurons, offering new avenues for PD treatment. Understanding the diverse functions and interactions of glial cells in the central nervous system is crucial for developing effective interventions for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Verbal instructions related to the arm swing amplitude and velocity change step gait behavior in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and neurotypical individuals. However, how verbal instructions related to upper limb act on interlimb coordination and prefrontal cortex activation are not yet known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the instructions to increase arm swing amplitude and velocity during walking on prefrontal cortex (PFC) hemodynamics and arm-leg interlimb coordination in PwPD and neurotypical individuals. Fifteen PwPD and 13 neurotypical individuals walked over a 26.8 m pathway under three experimental conditions: usual walking, walking with increased arm swing amplitude, and walking with increased arm swing velocity. Gait step parameters, continuous relative phase and latency between arm and leg movements, and PFC hemodynamics were calculated. ANOVA two-way (groups x conditions) showed that the verbal instructions to increase arm swing amplitude and velocity during walking improved gait step parameters and arm-leg interlimb coordination, without changing PFC hemodynamics. Specifically, verbal instructions increased average continuous relative phase (F2,52 = 45.5; p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.63) and decreased the average relative phase variability (F2,52 = 86.9; p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.77) in both groups and decreased PwPD latency (F2,52 = 3.5; p = 0.03; ηp2 = 0.19). Verbal instructions also increased stride length (F2,52 = 27.7; p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.51) and velocity (F2,52 = 46.6; p < 0.001; ηp2 = 0.64) and decreased double support phase in both groups. These results allow us to speculate that the engagement of the motor areas to follow the instructions and perform the ensuing action could be related to preservation of some automaticity and it is possible that the participants do not need to use their cognitive resources by increasing PFC activity to process and do the action.

Abstract: Background
Freezing of gait (FOG) is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) that markedly impacts patients’ quality of life. This review aims to identify clinical predictors of FOG to facilitate early prediction and future interventions.
Methods
A systematic review adhering to PRISMA guidelines was conducted. Comprehensive searches in PubMed, EBSCO, and Web of Science yielded 1761 records. After removing duplicates, 1558 records were screened by title and abstract, and 92 full-text articles were assessed. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and were qualitatively synthesized.
Results
Our systematic review indicates that higher baseline MDS-UPDRS scores, which reflect greater disease severity, alongside elevated doses and early use of levodopa, are predictive of FOG in patients with PD. Additionally, higher Postural Instability and Gait Disorder (PIGD) scores, motor fluctuations, and lower limb disease onset further increase the risk of FOG. Other factors associated with an increased risk of FOG include older age, longer disease duration, anxiety, hyposmia, cognitive deficits, and sleep disorders. Furthermore, decreased step initiation duration when using visual cues serves as a predictor for the development of FOG. Early treatment with amantadine, selegiline, and dopamine agonists may help reduce the risk of developing FOG.
Conclusion
A combination of motor and non-motor factors predicts the development of FOG. Understanding FOG predictors is crucial for developing future therapeutics and personalized management plans, enabling targeted interventions and improved outcomes.

Abstract: Background
Tremor, either in patients with Essential Tremor (ET) or Parkinson’s disease (PD), constitutes the most common movement disorder. Stereotactic radiosurgery using Gamma Knife (GK) and linear accelerator (LINAC) systems, is an effective, incisionless treatment modality for ET and PD. Although these technologies have been used clinically since the 1990′s, most studies have focused on GK, and efficacy, safety and time to treatment effect (latency) of GK and LINAC have not been compared.
Objective
We therefore aimed to conduct a systematic review with network meta-analysis examining efficacy, adverse events (AEs) and latency of GK and LINAC for treating tremor in ET and PD.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review with network meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, using the Embase and PubMed databases. We included all primary GK/LINAC thalamotomy studies in ET/PD patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, reporting unilateral Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Scale (FTM-TRS) or Unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores pre-treatment/post-treatment and/or AEs and/or latency. The primary efficacy outcome was FTM-TRS Scale A or UPDRS Item 16 score reduction. AEs were presented as an estimated incidence, and latency as average time to first recorded clinical improvement in tremor.
Results
Six studies of 311 patients and 2 studies of 60 patients met inclusion criteria for GK/LINAC efficacy comparison, respectively. Network meta-analysis showed similar tremor reduction between modalities (standardized mean difference between pre- and post-treatment scores: GK: −2.18 (95 % CI: −2.79, −1.57); LINAC: −2.13 (95 % CI: −5.13, 0.87). GK also had a higher absolute AE rate, while LINAC was associated with a greater latency period. There was no correlation between GK efficacy and AE rate.
Conclusions
Despite the relatively small sample sizes, these results demonstrate similar efficacy between GK and LINAC for ET and PD, with a trend toward higher efficacy but greater AE incidence and slower onset of tremor improvement in GK compared to LINAC.

Abstract: The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) was recently hypothesized to change along with the disease course. Given the fact that transcriptional changes in blood can provide insightful clues for PD pathogenesis, we performed case-control and longitudinal whole blood transcriptome analyses to identify the signature genes underlying the hypothesized dynamic pathogenesis of PD. In the case-control study, we compared the gene expression patterns in healthy control (N = 189), prodromal (N = 58) and de novo idiopathic PD subjects (N = 390). The results showed that the prodromal subjects were at the tipping-point stage, which is characterized by the abnormal expression patterns of 414 genes associated with oxygen transport and reactive oxygen species metabolic process. We next performed a longitudinal transcriptome analysis on 255 PD patients from the baseline to the third year, and identified 203 genes related to immune and inflammatory responses during disease progression. These findings not just offer deeper insights into the dynamic pathogenesis of PD, but also help to find potential drugs to prevent the early neurodegeneration process.

Abstract: Background
The Flanker task measures visuospatial attention and assesses the attentional network by distinguishing pathways for enhancing information at attended regions and suppressing information at unattended ones (Kopp et al., 1996). In Parkinson's disease (PD), the attentional network is impaired due to dysfunctional fronto-subcortical circuits connected to the basal ganglia, disrupting response selection and inhibition. While electroencephalography (EEG) may reveal abnormalities of these circuits in PD, dynamic brain oscillations critical for interareal communications cannot be deciphered with conventional time-frequency analyses.
Objective
To utilize the novel Holo-Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HHSA) to reveal dynamic EEG features of the Flanker task in PD patients and healthy normal controls for differentiating and elucidating attentional network deficits in patients.
Methods
The novel HHSA was applied to uncover nonlinear features of the Flanker task EEG and to analyse connectivity using phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling.
Results
Holo-Hilbert transform (HHT) results showed an attenuated midfrontal theta (FMθ) in the congruency effect in PD patients, consistent with past studies. HHSA showed a loss of low-frequency amplitude modulations (fam) in the theta carrier frequency band (fc) during the congruency effect in PD. Importantly, connectivity analyses using the Holo-Hilbert cross-frequency phase clustering (HHCFPC) revealed a loss of theta-gamma cross frequency coupling (CFC) from the right prefrontal cortex to other frontal and contralateral regions. Decrements were also shown in PD patients from right frontal cortical to occipital areas in theta-beta CFC.
Conclusions
These visuospatial attention deficits of PD revealed with the advanced analytical method of the HHSA and HHCFPC may inaugurate further neurophysiological biomarkers for cognitive function evaluation in PD and related movement disorders.

Abstract: Purpose
Inter-individual difference in levodopa responsiveness is a challenge for physicians to administer personalized treatment for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Previous studies demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) might lead to an incomplete response to levodopa. This study aimed to investigate the association between MRI-visible PVS and levodopa responsiveness in patients with PD.
Methods
This cross-sectional study enrolled a total of 327 patients with PD (median age 64.0[57.0–68.0] years, 180 male) who had undergone high-resolution T2-weighted structural MRI at our hospital between 2019 and 2023. An acute levodopa challenge test was performed to evaluate levodopa responsiveness. The patients were divided into two groups: levodopa responsive (MDS-UPDRS-III reduction ≥ 33 %, n = 274) and irresponsive groups (MDS-UPDRS-III reduction < 33 %, n = 53). We employed quantitative and semi-quantitative methods to evaluate MRI-visible PVS in patients with PD, including PVS number, volume fraction, and visual score. Additionally, the imaging features of the levodopa-responsive and irresponsive groups were compared.
Results
There were no significant differences in PVS number, volume fraction, and visual score between the levodopa-responsive and −irresponsive groups. The indicators from quantitative and semi-quantitative analyses of PVS were not found to be independent predictors of levodopa responsiveness. None of the indicators from the quantitative or semi-quantitative analyses of PVS were significantly associated with poor responsiveness to levodopa treatment.
Conclusions
MRI-visible PVS are not independently associated with levodopa responsiveness, and their value in predicting levodopa responsiveness in patients with PD is limited.

Abstract: Background
Emerging insights into the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) underscore the involvement of dysregulated neurotransmission, iron accumulation and oxidative stress. Nonetheless, the excitatory and inhibitory neurometabolites, the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), and magnetic susceptibility are seldom studied together in the clinical PD literature.
Methods
We acquired MEGA-PRESS and multi-echo gradient echo sequences from 60 PD patients and 47 healthy controls (HCs). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy voxels were respectively positioned in the midbrain to quantify neurotransmitter including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate plus glutamine, and in the left striatum to estimate GSH levels. Group differences in metabolite levels normalized to total creatine (Cr) and their clinical relevance were determined. Furthermore, relationships among GSH levels, neurotransmitter estimates and susceptibility values were explored in both PD patients and HCs.
Results
PD patients exhibited reduced midbrain GABA levels (P = 0.034, PFDR = 0.136), diminished GSH in the left striatum (P = 0.032, PFDR = 0.096), and increased susceptibility values in the substantia nigra (PFDR < 0.001). Mesencephalic choline levels were correlated with the severity of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders symptoms, whereas striatal N-acetylaspartate levels were linked to Hoehn-Yahr stage and motor symptom severity. Notably, the disruption of associations between striatal GSH levels and susceptibility values in globus pallidus, as well as midbrain GABA levels, were evident in PD.
Conclusions
These findings offer compelling evidence for metabolic dysregulation in PD, characterized by a concomitant reduction in GABA and GSH levels, alongside iron deposition.

Abstract: Purpose
Using regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) to assess alterations in brain function and their potential relation to different Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stages in Parkinson's disease (PD).
Materials and methods
66 patients with PD and 57 age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) participants were recruited. All subjects underwent clinical assessments and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning. We analyzed alterations in regional brain activity using ReHo analyses in all subjects and further explored their relationship to disease severity. Finally, the brain region significantly associated with disease severity was used as a seed point to analyze the FC changes between it and other brain regions in the whole brain.
Results
Compared with HC participants, PD patients showed a significant decrease ReHo in the sensorimotor network (bilateral precentral and postcentral gyrus). The ReHo value of the left precentral gyrus in PD patients decreased with increasing H&Y stage and correlated negatively with Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores. Further, FC analysis of the left precentral gyrus as a region of interest showed that functional activity between the left precentral gyrus and sensorimotor network, default network, and visual network was decreased.
Conclusion
The left precentral gyrus plays an important role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD patients, and this finding further highlights the potential of the primary motor cortex (M1) as a non-invasive therapeutic target for neuromodulation in PD patients.

Abstract: Purpose
This study aimed to assess the glymphatic function and its correlation with clinical characteristics and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) using hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS), choroid plexus volume (CPV), and enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) volume.
Methods
Twenty-five PD patients and thirty matched healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All participants underwent 18F-fluorodopa (18F-DOPA) PET-MRI scanning. The striatal standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), DTI-ALPS index, CPV, and EPVS volume were calculated. Furthermore, we also analysed the relationship between the DTI-ALPS index, CPV, EPVS volume and striatal SUVR as well as clinical characteristics of PD patients.
Results
PD patients demonstrated significantly lower values in DTI-ALPS (t = 3.053, p = 0.004) and larger CPV (t = 2.743, p = 0.008) and EPVS volume (t = 2.807, p = 0.008) compared to HC. In PD group, the ALPS-index was negatively correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS-III) scores (r = −0.730, p < 0.001), and positively correlated with the mean putaminal SUVR (r = 0.560, p = 0.007) and mean caudal SUVR (r = 0.459, p = 0.032). Moreover, the mean putaminal SUVR was negatively associated with the UPDRS-III scores (r = −0.544, p = 0.009).
Conclusion
DTI-ALPS has the potential to uncover glymphatic dysfunction in patients with PD, with this dysfunction correlating strongly with the severity of disease, together with the mean putaminal and caudal SUVR. PET- MRI can serve as a potential multimodal imaging biomarker for early-stage PD.

Abstract: Goal and aims
To pilot the feasibility and evaluate the performance of an EEG wearable for measuring sleep in individuals with Parkinson’s disease.
Focus technology
Dreem Headband, Version 2.
Reference technology
Polysomnography.
Sample
Ten individuals with Parkinson’s disease.
Design
Individuals wore Dreem Headband during a single night of polysomnography.
Core analytics
Comparison of summary metrics, bias, and epoch-by-epoch analysis.
Additional analytics and exploratory analyses
Correlation of summary metrics with demographic and Parkinson’s disease characteristics.
Core outcomes
Summary statistics showed Dreem Headband overestimated several sleep metrics, including total sleep, efficiency, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep, with an exception in light sleep. Epoch-by-epoch analysis showed greater specificity than sensitivity, with adequate accuracy across sleep stages (0.55-0.82).
Important supplemental outcomes
Greater Parkinson’s disease duration and rapid eye movement behavior were associated with more wakefulness, and worse Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms were associated with less deep sleep.
Core conclusion
The Dreem Headband performs similarly in Parkinson’s disease as it did in non-Parkinson’s disease samples and shows promise for improving access to sleep assessment in people with Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Background and objective
Motor diagnosis, monitoring and management of Parkinson's disease (PD) focuses mainly on observational methods and, clinical scales, resulting in a subjective evaluation. Inertial sensors combined with artificial intelligence have emerged as a promising solution to help physicians perform early, differential, and objective quantification of motor symptoms over time. We hypothesize that a long short-term memory-deep neural network (LSTM) architecture could be an appropriate solution for producing three models to provide a holistic assessment of patients with PD from a single inertial sensor.
Methods
A custom dataset with 40 patients was created to train and test three deep learning models to classify PD disease stages, motor conditions and quality of life (QoL).
Results
We verified an accuracy of 89 % for the disease stage classifier, 91.7 % for the motor condition classifier, and an accuracy of 87.8 % for the QoL classifier.
Conclusions
We confirmed that an LSTM architecture could produce three models to improve PD management.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that manifests with both motor and non-motor symptoms, with α-synuclein misfolding recognized as a key contributor. Cognitive decline in advanced PD stages prompts interest in amyloid deposition, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as a potential factor. This study explores the impact of β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology in PD patients on disease progression, aiming to elucidate the role of Aβ in PD development and progression.
Methods
This study included autopsy-confirmed PD patients with post-mortem analyses from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Comprehensive clinical assessments, including demographic data, clinical features, CSF markers, and neuroimaging, were conducted. Statistical analyses assessed differences between groups based on the severity of AD neuropathological changes.
Results
All 16 PD participants exhibited severe Lewy body pathology, with 75 % displaying AD neuropathological changes. At baseline, PD patients with severe or moderate AD neuropathological changes had a lower Aβ42 levels (p = 0.022) and Aβ42/tau ratio (p = 0.001). Longitudinal follow-up data indicated that individuals with severe or moderate AD neuropathological changes exhibited a more rapid decline in MOCA score and BJLOT score, along with a quicker increase in MDS-UPDRS Ⅲ score.
Conclusions
The study underscores the presence of severe Aβ pathology in PD, suggesting a role in accelerated disease progression. Cross-seeding between Aβ and α-synuclein may contribute to rapid clinical symptom progression. Further research is needed for a comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative disease complexities and exploring potential therapeutic interventions targeting protein aggregation.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains a major challenge in the field of neurodegenerative diseases and requires innovative therapeutic approaches. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in PD using a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model. CDCA, a naturally occurring bile acid, has previously shown promise in various neurological disorders by reducing neuronal degeneration and promoting neuronal health, however its utility in PD has not been studied. We divided mice into a control group, an MPTP-induced PD model and a treatment group injected with CDCA. CDCA reduced motor impairment and ameliorated anxiety-like behavior as assessed through the pole and open field test, demonstrated antidepressant effects in the forced swim and tail suspension test, and results of the Y-maze test showed improved cognitive performance. Furthermore, the effective defense against MPTP-induced dopaminergic degeneration was provided by CDCA by improving the morphological and histological features of neurons in the midbrain, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum. Analysis via RT-PCR revealed that CDCA significantly mitigated MPP + -induced elevations in α-synuclein levels, indicating its potential to preserve neuronal function by modulating synaptic integrity. Additionally, CDCA effectively reduced the associated toxicity by enhancing the low levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Conclusively, given the increasing prevalence of PD and the urgent need for effective neuroprotective strategies, our findings suggest that CDCA exerts neuroprotective effects in an MPTP-induced PD model. These results highlight CDCA as a promising candidate for further investigation in PD therapy and provide a basis for further research into bile acid-based treatments in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Our ability to define, understand, and classify Parkinson's disease (PD) has undergone significant changes since the disorder was first described in 1817. Clinical features and neuropathologic signatures can now be supplemented by in-vivo interrogation of genetic and biological substrates of disease, offering great opportunity for further refining the diagnosis of PD. In this mini-review, we discuss the historical perspectives which shaped our thinking surrounding the definition and diagnosis of PD. We highlight the clinical, genetic, pathologic and biologic diversity which underpins the condition, and proceed to discuss how recent developments in our ability to define biologic and pathologic substrates of disease might impact PD definition, diagnosis, individualised prognostication, and personalised clinical care. We argue that Parkinson's ‘disease’, as currently diagnosed in the clinic, is actually a syndrome. It is the outward manifestation of any array of potential dysfunctional biologic processes, neuropathological changes, and disease aetiologies, which culminate in common outward clinical features which we term PD; each person has their own unique disease, which we can now define with increasing precision. This is an exciting time in PD research and clinical care. Our ability to refine the clinical diagnosis of PD, incorporating in-vivo assessments of disease biology, neuropathology, and neurogenetics may well herald the era of biologically-based, precision medicine approaches PD management. With this however comes a number of challenges, including how to integrate these technologies into clinical practice in a way which is acceptable to patients, promotes meaningful changes to care, and minimises health economic impact.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are common neurodegenerative diseases with multifaceted etiology. Nutritional and metabolic abnormalities are frequently implicated in PD and AD. In this observational study, we analyzed a series of nutritional markers, and aimed to understand their association with AD and PD risk.
Methods
A total of 424 PD patients, 314 AD patients, and 388 healthy controls were included. Nutritional markers including Hemoglobin A1c, vitamin B12, folate, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), uric acid and homocysteine (HCY) were measured. Significance for odds ratios examining was P < 0.0045 after bonferroni correction.
Results
Multifactor risk analysis showed that ApoB, LDL, and TC reduce PD risk, while HCY increase PD risk. ApoA1 and HCY are protective and risk factors for AD, respectively.
Conclusion
The cross-sectional study demonstrates that HCY and lipid metabolism markers are associated with PD and AD risks. Our findings support the involvement of one-carbon metabolism and lipid metabolism disturbance in PD and AD.

Abstract: Brain atrophy is detected in early Parkinson's disease (PD) and accelerates over the first few years post-diagnosis. This was captured by multiple cross-sectional studies and a few longitudinal studies in early PD. Yet only a longitudinal study with a control group can capture accelerated atrophy in early PD and differentiate it from healthy ageing. Accordingly, we performed a multicohort longitudinal analysis between PD and healthy ageing, examining subcortical regions implicated in PD pathology, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, corpus callosum (CC), and cerebellum. Longitudinal volumetric analysis was performed on 56 early PD patients and 53 matched controls, with scans collected 2–3 years apart. At baseline, the PD group showed a greater volume in the pallidum, thalamus, and cerebellar white matter (WM), suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms in prodromal and early PD. After 2–3 years, accelerated atrophy in PD was observed in the putamen and cerebellar WM. Interestingly, healthy controls – but not PD patients – demonstrated a significant decline in Total Intracranial Volume (TIV), and atrophy in the thalamus and mid-CC. Between-group analysis revealed more severe atrophy in the right striatum and cerebellar WM in PD, and in the mid-posterior CC in controls. Using CEREbellum Segmentation (CERES) for lobule segmentation on the longitudinal PD cohort, we found a significant decline in the WM of non-motor regions in the cerebellum, specifically Crus I and lobule IX. Our results highlight an initial increase in cerebellar WM volume during prodromal PD, followed by significant degeneration over the first few years post-diagnosis.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) affects millions worldwide. In recent years, the role of the gut-brain axis and gut microbiome alterations in neurodegenerative diseases has gained significant attention. Lifestyle and environment factors play a crucial role in shaping the overall health. Herein, we investigated whether obesity induced by high-fat diet (HFD) combined with low-dose rotenone (5 mg/kg; orally, twice a day) exacerbates PD-like pathology. Our findings reveal non-motor symptoms of PD alongside gut inflammation, α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, and dysbiosis, possibly mediated by transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. In the brain, we observed the characteristic α-syn pathology in the substantia nigra (SN) and the striatum. Finally, we observe neuroinflammation including astrogliosis, microgliosis and increased expression of TRPV1 channel in the SN and striatum possibly hinting to PD like pathological features. The in-vitro findings in N2a and C6 glial cell lines hint towards possible co-relation of increased TRPV1 in response to lipotoxicity and rotenone exposure which was recovered when treated with TRPV1 antagonist; Capsazepine. In summary, we propose that HFD along with low dose rotenone poses a risk for neuronal health; exaggerating the neuroinflammatory states.

Abstract: As the population ages, the incidence of Parkinson’s disease has been progressively increasing, becoming a significant global public health concern. This disease is closely associated with the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein, which adversely affects neuronal function and exacerbates symptoms. Recent studies have indicated that the lymphatic system plays a crucial role in clearing metabolic waste from the brain. However, patients with Parkinson’s disease often exhibit dysfunction of the brain’s lymphatic system, resulting in impaired clearance of α-synuclein. Therefore, reducing the accumulation of α-synuclein in the brain has emerged as a therapeutic target for Parkinson’s disease. In this context, a hypothesis is proposed regarding the use of deep cervical lymphovenous bypass surgery. This procedure aims to create a pathway for the drainage of cerebrospinal lymph by anastomosing the deep cervical lymphatic vessels with the cervical veins, thereby accelerating lymphatic drainage and improving the drainage function of the brain’s lymphatic system. If this hypothesis is validated, it could provide new solution into the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, potentially halting disease progression and possibly being applicable to other neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Background
The brain is a complex dynamic system comprising multiple information-processing units. The characterization of brain systems and understanding of their organization and reconfiguration in different states remains an ongoing challenge. This study aims to explore the organization of brain complexity in Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Methods
In this study, we developed a framework to measure the complexity of each unit and explore aberrant patterns in PD. The resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent signals were converted into a state series with spatiotemporal coding of the whole brain system, and subsequently calculated the Shannon entropy of the state series (referred to as state entropy).
Results
In a total of 152 participants (PD patients n ​= ​73, normal controls n ​= ​79), we revealed a descent entropy gradient from the neocortex, particularly the default mode network (DMN), to subcortical systems. Subsequent application of a two-sample t-test and multiple comparison correction revealed that the state entropy of the visual, sensorimotor, and limbic networks was significantly increased in the PD group. Additionally, we obtained the person-based similarity index (PBSI) of state entropy within each network to measure individual variability, finding that patients with PD have decreased PBSI scores on the visual, sensorimotor, and limbic networks, and increased PBSI of entropy on the DMN. Notably, when testing the classification performance of state entropy and PBSI metrics, we found that individual variability was more effective in recognizing patients with PD.
Conclusions
Our study reveals the organization of brain complexity across healthy and PD states, and suggests that personalized measures of brain reconfiguration have the potential to help develop clinical assistant diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Although dopamine agonists have been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of motor symptoms, their capacity to enhance non-motor symptoms remains constrained. This suggests that additional neurotransmitter systems may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD-related symptoms. The cholinergic nervous system plays a pivotal role in the central nervous system, with various projection systems associated with diverse functions, including but not limited to learning, memory, attention, posture, balance, eye movement control, and adaptation. Nevertheless, the role of the cholinergic nervous system in the motor and non-motor impairments associated with PD remains uncertain. This review elucidates the location, projection, receptors, and effects of central cholinergic systems, as well as their role in both the motor symptoms and non-motor symptoms of PD. Additionally, it examines the crosstalk between cholinergic systems and dopaminergic systems in PD pathology. A deeper comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms of the cholinergic system in PD may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Gait abnormalities in Parkinson’s disease (PD) can reflect the extent of dysfunction, and making their assessment crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of PD. Current video-based methods of PD gait assessment are limited to only focusing on skeleton motion information and are confined to evaluations from a single perspective. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel vision-skeleton dual-modality framework, which integrates keypoints vision features with skeleton motion information to enable a more accurate and comprehensive assessment of PD gait. We firstly introduce the Keypoints Vision Transformer, a novel architecture designed to extract vision features of human keypoints. This model encompasses both the spatial locations and connectivity relationships of human keypoints. Subsequently, through the proposed temporal fusion encoder, we integrate the extracted skeleton motion with keypoints vision features to enhance the extraction of temporal motion features. In a video dataset of 241 PD participants recorded from the front, our proposed framework achieves an assessment accuracy of 78.05%, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other methods. To enhance the interpretability of our method, we also conduct a feature visualization analysis of the proposed dual-modality framework, which reveal the mechanisms of different body parts and dual-modality branch in PD gait assessment. Additionally, when applied to another video dataset recorded from a more general perspective, our method still achieves a commendable accuracy of 73.07%. This achievement demonstrates the robust generalization capability of the proposed model in PD gait assessment from cross-view, which offers a novel approach for realizing unrestricted PD gait assessment in home monitoring. The latest version of the code is available at https://github.com/FJNU-LWP/PD-gait-VSDF.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in both motor and non-motor symptoms. A defining feature of PD pathology is the presence of Lewy bodies, which are intracellular inclusions primarily composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein (α-syn) proteins. The abnormal buildup of α-syn, referred to as α-synucleopathy, is a key aspect of PD and other neurodegenerative conditions. Recent research indicates that bacterial amyloids, such as curli proteins produced by Escherichia coli, may influence α-syn aggregation, potentially playing a role in PD development. These discoveries provide a new perspective on the involvement of microbial factors in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that curli proteins can cross-seed with α-syn and enhance its aggregation. Understanding these interactions opens up new therapeutic possibilities, including methods to inhibit curli production, prevent curli-α-syn interactions, or target the resulting pathological aggregates. Such therapeutic strategies could offer promising new ways to slow or stop the progression of PD and improve outcomes for patients.

Abstract: Background
Postural instability is considered one of the most incapacitating motor symptoms and a primary cause of falls in Parkinson's disease (PD), compromising patients' autonomy and well-being. The traditional clinical examination used to evaluate this symptom designed by pull test is difficult to standardize and is not sensitive to subtle but significant postural changes. Inertial measurement units have emerged as a portable and cost-effective solution to measure on-body patients' postural sway allowing them to obtain more sensitive metrics able to capture postural instability. However, further studies are required to monitor patients' postural conditions under dynamic conditions.
Methods
The proposed research focused on investigating the hypothesis of whether it is possible to differentiate between all the scores of the pull test through postural and gait metrics extracted from raw acceleration and angular velocity signals from the centre of mass of patients with PD acquired while performing basic daily tasks. A new cross-sectional study was conducted with 23 patients to determine which gait and postural-associated metrics are considered significant to distinguish between the different levels of pull test, and which metrics are more correlated with the pull test score.
Results
Achieved results showed that most of the estimated metrics can differentiate the pull test scores (ρ-value≤0.048, R≥20.513). The duration of the activity, root-mean-square and range of motion of vertical and mediolateral angular velocity, as also most of the gait-associated metrics, presented the most significant differences in all trials which involved motion tasks, such as sitting, lying, walking and turning.
Conclusions:
Overall, promising results were achieved as the statistical analysis revealed that gait and postural metrics estimated under dynamic conditions were considered relevant to distinguish between the scores of the pull test.

Abstract: Neuroinflammation, α-synuclein pathology and dopaminergic cell loss are the hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD), an incurable movement disorder. The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) impedes the delivery of therapeutics and makes the design of drug-targeting delivery vehicles challenging. Nanomedicine is designed and has significantly impacted the scientific community. Over the last few decades, to address the shortcomings of synthetic nanoparticles, a new approach has emerged that mimic the physiological environment. Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles have been developed to interact with the physiological environment, enhance central nervous system drug delivery and mask toxic effects. Cell membranes are multifunctional, biocompatible platforms with the potential for surface modification and targeted delivery design. A synchronous design of cell membrane and nanoparticles is required for the cell membrane-based biomimetics, which can improve the BBB recognition and transport. This review summarizes the challenges in drug delivery and how cell membrane-coated nanoparticles can overcome them. Moreover, major cell membranes used in biomedical applications are discussed with a focus on PD.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a system-level disorder that implicates brain network dynamics across multiple scales. Detecting the ‘arrow of time’, or temporal reversibility of the brain’s information processing flow enables quantification of equilibrium in the brain and inferences on the hierarchical organization. Therefore we aimed to explore disturbances in resting-state equilibrium levels as well as changes in the hierarchical organization due to PD.
Methods
Structural and functional MRI of 29 PD patients and 19 healthy controls were acquired and analyzed. Empirical non-reversibility was computed as the distance between time-shifted forward- and artificially-reversed time series. Levels of equilibrium were subsequently assessed globally and within two cortico-subcortical motor networks implicated in PD. Moreover, whole-brain generative computational models consisting of 1051 Hopf oscillators were constructed to evaluate effective connectivities and alterations of the functional hierarchical organization.
Results
We found that PD is characterized by disrupted equilibrium regimes, marked by distinct effective connectivity patterns, particularly within the motor networks. Additionally, we observed a flatter hierarchical organization in PD, with the cerebellum and thalamus exerting increased influence.
Conclusion
The arrow of time methodology effectively identifies distinct and informative characteristics of PD. Our analyses suggest that PD shifts the brain towards less efficient, non-equilibrium dynamics that impair intrinsic flexibility and disrupt motor coordination. Thus, these findings not only provide insight into widespread system alterations in PD that could serve as potential biomarkers, but also lay the groundwork for next-generation stimulation techniques aimed at restoring balance in the Parkinsonian brain.

Abstract: Depression in Parkinson’s disease (dPD) is a prevalent comorbidity significantly impairing patients’ quality of life. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of neuroinflammation in dPD pathogenesis, particularly the interaction between neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has been implicated in mood regulation and neuroinflammatory processes, yet its role in modulating pyroptosis and microglial polarization remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization in dPD pathogenesis and explore the regulation of 5-HT on these processes. A C57BL/6 mouse model of dPD was established using injected intraperitoneally of rotenone to observe changes in body weight, sucrose preference, and exercise time. ELISA and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of relevant proteins and cytokines in the hippocampus. Co-culture experiments with HT22 and BV2 cells were conducted to explore the effect of 5-HT on neuronal pyroptosis and microglial polarization. Rotenone-induced dPD in mice led to reduced body weight, sucrose preference, and activity, accompanied by upregulation of pyroptosis markers (NLRP1, N-GSDMD, Cleaved-caspase-1) and increased M1 microglial polarization. Treatment with 5-HT and the pyroptosis inhibitor Pep19–2.5 reversed these changes, mitigating neuronal pyroptosis and shifting microglial polarization towards a less inflammatory profile. In vitro, 5-HTP suppressed LPS-induced neuronal pyroptosis, reducing TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18 levels and oxidative stress while preserving microglial viability. The 5-HT inhibitor Scopolamine abolished these effects. Neuronal pyroptosis and M1 microglial polarization contribute critically to dPD pathogenesis. By inhibiting these processes, 5-HT emerges as a promising therapeutic target for managing dPD, offering new insights into its treatment mechanisms.

Abstract: Drug Repurposing gives us facility to find the new uses of previously developed drugs rather than developing new drugs from start. Particularly during pandemic, drug repurposing caught much attention to provide new applications of the previously approved drugs. In our research, we provide a novel method for drug repurposing based on feature learning process from drug–disease–gene network. In our research, we aimed at finding drug candidates which can be repurposed under neurodegenerative diseases and glioma. We collected association data between drugs, diseases and genes from public resources and primarily examined the data related to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Glioma diseases. We created a Knowledge Graph using neo4j by integrating all these datasets and applied scalable feature learning algorithm known as node2vec to create node embeddings. These embeddings were later used to predict the unknown associations between disease and their candidate drugs by finding cosine similarity between disease and drug nodes embedding. We obtained a definitive set of candidate drugs for repurposing. These results were validated from the literature and CodReS online tool to rank the candidate drugs. Additionally, we verified the status of candidate drugs from pharmaceutical knowledge databases to confirm their significance.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by significant impairment in social, emotional, and cognitive functioning. Its precise pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Alterations in protein homeostasis and some misfolded proteins have been identified within the brains of patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast to neurodegenerative processes such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein (α-Syn) protein is a primary cause of significant neuronal loss, altered proteostasis in MDD may result in loss-of-function effects by modifying synaptic neuroplasticity. Moreover, aberrant activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways may intensify the pathological alterations due to altered proteostasis. In this study, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and caudate nucleus from MDD patients and non-psychiatric controls were used. Postmortem samples of same brain areas from PD patients (Braak 2–3 and 5–6) and controls were also included. Protein levels of ER and unfolded protein response (UPR), synucleins (α-, β- and γ-Syn), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured by Western-Blot. Phospho-eIF2α/eIF2α ratio was increased in the dlPFC and caudate nucleus of MDD and PD patients compared to their respective controls. Brain area-dependent changes in BiP and GRP94 levels were also found. We further detected accumulation of immature BDNF precursors and opposite changes in α- and β-Syn levels in the dlPFC of MDD and PD patients compared to controls. Our findings suggest that alterations in proteostasis contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD, as previously described in PD. A deeper understanding of the pathways involved will identify other candidate proteins and new targets with therapeutic potential.

Abstract: This paper introduces a mobile cloud-based predictive model for assisting Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. PD, a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, impairs motor functions and daily tasks due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. The model utilizes smartphones to aid patients in collecting voice samples, which are then sent to a cloud service for storage and processing. A hybrid deep learning model, trained using the UCI Parkinson's Telemonitoring Voice dataset, analyzes this data to estimate the severity of PD symptoms. The model's performance is noteworthy, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics of 96.2 %, 94.15 %, and 96.15 %, respectively. Additionally, it boasts a rapid response time of just 13 s. Results are delivered to users via smartphone alert notifications, coupled with a knowledge base feature that educates them about PD. This system provides reliable home-based assessment and monitoring of PD and enables prompt medical intervention, significantly enhancing the quality of life for patients with Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, and α-synuclein aggregation. While L-DOPA provides symptomatic relief through dopamine replenishment, it lacks neuroprotective effects and fails to address oxidative stress, iron dysregulation, and protein aggregation underlying PD pathogenesis. The development of antioxidant enzymes shows promise, yet challenges persist in blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and effective neuroinflammation mitigation. Our preliminary investigations revealed that the coordination between Icariside II (ICS II) and Fe3+ facilitates the formation of self-assembled metal-polyphenol nanozymes (Fe-Ic) with enhanced antioxidant capabilities and iron chelation functionality. Building on this discovery, we engineered neutrophil membrane-coated nanozymes (R-NM@Fe-Ic) with DSPE-PEG-RVG29 modification through a rational design strategy targeting both iron dysregulation and ferroptosis in PD, enabling targeted delivery to neuroinflammatory regions. R-NM@Fe-Ic demonstrated dual enzyme-like activities, reducing α-synuclein aggregation, suppressing lipid peroxidation, and increasing glutathione peroxidase 4 expression, thereby preventing neuronal ferroptosis more effectively than L-DOPA. Additionally, it promoted mitophagy, inhibiting toxic protein aggregation and reducing neuroinflammation. In vivo studies confirmed efficient BBB penetration with targeted accumulation in PD-affected brain regions. Behavioral analyses showed significant improvements in motor function, spontaneous movement, and cognitive performance, outperforming L-DOPA in both symptom management and neuroprotection. This study establishes a novel platform for biomimetic nanozymes and provides insights into their therapeutic potential by simultaneously targeting ferroptosis and enhancing mitophagy pathways in neuroinflammatory disorders.

Abstract: Cognitive decline is one of the most significant non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), with executive dysfunction (EDF) being the most prominent characteristic of PD-associated cognitive deficits. Currently, lack of uniformity in the conceptualization and assessment scales for executive functions impedes the early and accurate diagnosis of EDF in PD. The neurobiological mechanisms of EDF in PD remain poorly understood. Moreover, the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD has progressed slowly and with limited efficacy. Thus, this review explores the characteristics and potential mechanisms of EDF in PD from multiple perspectives, including the concept of executive function, commonly used neuropsychological tests, neurobiochemistry, genetics, electroencephalographic activity and neuroimaging. The available evidence indicates that degeneration of the frontal-striatal circuit, along with mutations in the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene, may contribute to EDF in patients with PD. The increase in theta and delta waves, along with the decrease in alpha waves, offers potential biomarkers for the early identification and monitoring of EDF, as well as the development of dementia in patients with PD. The PD cognition-related pattern (PDCP) pattern may serve as a tool for monitoring and assessing cognitive function progression in these patients and is anticipated to become a biomarker for cognitive disorders associated with PD. The aim is to provide new insights for the early and precise diagnosis and treatment of EDF in PD.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's Disease (PD) often presents with a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB), which hyperglycemia may exacerbate. Pericytes, a key cell for BBB integrity, are potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disorders. Few studies have developed 3D PD cell models incorporating neurovascular units (NVU) through the co-culture of human endothelial, pericytes, astrocytes, and SH-SY5Y cells to evaluate BBB impairment and the role of pericytes under hyperglycemic condition.
Method
A 3D PD like cell model was developed using 6-OHDA-affected SH-SY5Y cells, combined with endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes through the Real Architecture for Tissue (RAFT) 3D co-culture system. PD incorporating reduced (30 % and 89 %) PDGFRβ NVU (RPN) with or without hyperglycemic model (HM) were also established. BBB permeability to sodium fluorescein was assessed, and BBB impairment was evaluated using BBB-associated proteins (ZO-1, CD54, CD144), cell-specific proteins (CD31, GFAP, PDGFRβ, CD13), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), α-synuclein, oligomeric α-synuclein, and α-synuclein (ser9).
Results
PD 3D cell models incorporating RPN with or without hyperglycemia were successfully established in vitro. Graduately increased BBB impairment was observed in PD, PD with RPN, and PD with RPN combined with HM, indicated by decreased BBB-associated and cell-specific proteins, reduced TH, and increased α-synuclein, oligomeric α-synuclein, and α-synuclein (ser9) compared to the NVU model.
Conclusion
Reduced pericyte PDGFRβ could increase BBB permeability, accelerate PD progression, and exacerbate under hyperglycemic condition.

Abstract: Emerging evidence indicates that electroacupuncture (EA) exerts significant therapeutic effects on Parkinson's disease (PD)-related symptoms, with the immune mechanisms of the gut-brain axis playing a pivotal role in PD pathophysiology. This study aimed to explore whether EA mitigated PD-related symptoms and conferred neuroprotection to dopaminergic neurons in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model by modulating the microbiota-metabolized lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/NLRP3 pathway. EA treatment ameliorated motor and anxiety symptoms in 6-OHDA rats and elevated the levels of TH. Metabolomic analysis indicated that the therapeutic effects of EA are associated with the gut microbiota and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated that EA significantly modified the composition of the gut microbiota, evidenced by alterations in the relative abundance of 16 genera, and led to the downregulation of the LPS and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Additionally, EA was found to attenuate intestinal inflammation, decrease serum inflammatory markers, reduce neuroinflammation, and suppress the overexpression of microglia and astrocytes, while concurrently preserving the integrity of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers. Fecal microbiota transplantation experiments further substantiated the pivotal role of gut microbiota in mediating the anti-PD effects of EA. In summary, EA has the potential to alleviate PD-related symptoms and safeguard dopaminergic neurons by rectifying gut microbiota dysbiosis and downregulating the LPS/NLRP3 immune pathway along the gut-brain axis in PD rat models.

Abstract: Objective
The loss of locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine system may contribute to freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD), but free-water (FW) imaging has not been applied to investigate LC microstructural degeneration in FOG. This study was to investigate the role of the LC-norepinephrine system in FOG pathophysiology using FW imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Methods
FW metrics of LC were analyzed in 52 healthy controls, 79 PD patients without FOG (Non-FOG), and 110 PD patients with FOG (48 “Off-period” FOG and 62 “Levodopa unresponsive” FOG). Correlation between LC FW metrics and clinical scales were assessed. Functional connectivity analysis with LC as the region of interest was performed across groups during medication withdrawal. Structural and functional differences in LC between FOG subgroups and the effects of dopaminergic medication were also explored.
Results
FOG patients had increased FW value, FW-corrected mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in LC, and decreased FW-corrected fractional anisotropy compared to Non-FOG patients and healthy controls. In FOG patients, FW value and FW-corrected mean axial diffusivity were positively correlated with the new FOG questionnaire scores. LC functional connectivity with occipital regions was reduced in FOG patients. No significant differences in LC microstructure or functional connectivity were observed between FOG subgroups during their “OFF” state. In contrast to “Levodopa-unresponsive” FOG patients, oral medication significantly improved LC functional connectivity with occipital regions in “Off-period” FOG patients.
Conclusions
LC degeneration may disrupt motor and compensatory network integration, especially in visual-motor pathways, contributing to FOG.

Abstract: Introduction
Advance care planning (ACP) is a tool for optimizing end-of-life care and is an important aspect of healthcare for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, there may be disparities in access to ACP based on race and/or ethnicity.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of people with PD and care partners from a diverse academic Movement Disorders clinic regarding familiarity with ACP and sociodemographic factors. We compared prior experiences with ACP, with a primary outcome examining prior completion of healthcare power of attorney (HPOA) and advance directives (AD) among Hispanics and non-Hispanics in the cohort. Univariate analysis was utilized to compare cohort demographics. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to control for possible confounders.
Results
250 participants completed the survey, including 116 (46.4 %) who self-identified as Hispanic and 127 (50.8 %) non-Hispanic. Only 20 % of Hispanic participants had previously completed HPOA documentation versus 66.9 % non-Hispanics (p < 0.001). The rates of completion for AD were 6.1 % and 31.7 %, respectively (p < 0.001). Hispanic respondents were less likely to have heard about these documents and more likely to wait until later in the disease course to discuss ACP, despite a majority viewing these discussions as important. These trends remained when controlling for several demographic variables; however, age and preferred language of survey emerged as potential confounders for some answer choices.
Conclusions
Hispanic people with PD may be less likely to utilize ACP than their non-Hispanic counterparts. Awareness of these resources or cultural factors may play a role and should be explored further in future studies.

Abstract: Background
Recent studies demonstrated the validity, reliability, and accuracy of consumer smartwatches for measuring daily steps in people with Parkinson disease (PD). However, no study to date has estimated the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for average daily steps (avDS), measured through a consumer smartwatch in people with PD.
Objective
This study aimed to calculate the MCID of avDS, measured through a commercial smartwatch (Garmin Vivosmart 4) in people with PD.
Methods
People with PD with a disease stage <4, without cognitive impairment, and who were able to walk unaided, wore a Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch for 5 consecutive days on the wrist least affected by the disease, allowing the computation of avDS. To define the 3 levels of MCID for avDS, we used an anchor-based method linked to: (1) scales capturing subtle changes in global mobility and motor functions, (2) clinical and health-related measures, and (3) disease-related patient-reported outcomes. Linear regressions, Student t test, and ANOVA were used to estimate the minimal change in avDS based on anchors relevant change. For each level, the overall MCID was calculated as the average of the variables included, and the range was reported.
Results
A total of 100 people with PD were enrolled. Participants took on average 5949 (SD 3034) daily steps, ranging from 357 to 12,620. The MCID of avDS anchored to standardized measures of motor symptoms and mobility was 581 steps/day (range  554‐608) or around 10% of mean avDS in our population. The MCID of avDS anchored to clinical and health-related variables was 1200 steps/day (range  350‐1683), or around 20% of mean avDS in our population. Finally, the MCID of avDS anchored to disease-related patient-reported outcomes was 1592 steps/day (range 594‐2589), or around 27% of the mean avDS in our population.
Conclusions
These findings could be relevant for designing future clinical trials involving avDS as a digital mobility outcome in daily life for people with PD and evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention promoting free-living walking in this population.

Abstract: Summary
Accurate diagnosis of early Parkinson’s disease requires platforms suitable for detecting minute amounts of neuronally derived biomarkers in the massive protein excess of easily accessible biofluids such as blood. Here, we describe an on-chip droplet-confined fluorescence reporting assay that identified α-synuclein on the membrane of L1CAM+ extracellular vesicles (EVs) immunocaptured from human serum and corroborate this finding by super-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) microscopy. Using conditioned media from neuroblastoma cells expressing α-synuclein mutants or patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons with α-synuclein gene triplication, we found that association of α-synuclein with the L1CAM+ EV surface is increased under pathological conditions. Accordingly, this readout, as measured by the droplet-based assay, is an improved predictive biomarker in the prodromal phase (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.93) or diagnostic biomarker in the clinical phase (AUC = 0.95) of Parkinson’s disease. More broadly, our platform will simplify the assessment of EV membrane proteins and facilitate their application as diagnostic biomarkers across diverse clinical indications.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and non-motor functions, including speech. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the audio spectrogram transformer (AST) model in detecting PD through vocal biomarkers, hypothesizing that its self-attention mechanism would better capture PD related speech impairments compared to traditional deep learning approaches. Speech recordings from 150 participants (100 from PC-GITA: 50 PD, 50 healthy controls (HC); 50 from Italian Parkinson’s voice and speech (ITA): 28 PD, 22 HC) were analyzed using the AST model and compared against established architectures including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, vision transformer, and swin transformer. Audio preprocessing included sampling rate standardization to 16 kHz and amplitude normalization. The AST model achieved superior classification performance across all datasets: 97.14% accuracy on ITA, 91.67% on Parkinson's Colombian - Grupo de Investigación en Telecomunicaciones Aplicadas (PC-GITA), and 92.73% on the combined dataset. Performance remained consistent across different speech tasks, with particularly strong results in sustained vowel analysis (precision: 0.97 ± 0.03, recall: 0.96 ± 0.03). The model demonstrated robust cross-lingual generalization, outperforming traditional architectures by 5%-10% in accuracy. These results suggest that the AST model provides a reliable, non-invasive method for PD detection through voice analysis, with strong performance across different languages and speech tasks. The model's success in cross-lingual generalization indicates potential for broader clinical application, though validation across more diverse populations is needed for clinical implementation.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects 10 million individuals worldwide with no available disease modifying therapies. The pathological hallmark of PD, Lewy bodies, are characterized by aggregated α-synuclein (α-syn) inclusions in disease lesions. In preclinical models, aggregation of α-syn leads to neuronal dysfunction, cell death, and propagation of Lewy pathology. Six clinical stage α-syn targeting monoclonal antibodies that were developed to treat or slow the progression of PD have advanced into efficacy trials, but none to date have achieved their primary endpoints. Except cinpanemab, which binds the N-terminus of α-syn, all other clinical α-syn antibodies bind C-terminal epitopes. To evaluate the impact of binding characteristics on functional activity, we affinity matured cinpanemab and benchmarked it against the clinical antibodies that vary in their affinity and selectivity for aggregated forms of α-syn. Our evaluation shows the impact of epitope, affinity, selectivity, and assay format on PFF uptake, and PFF-seed induced aggregation and S129 phosphorylation of endogenous α-syn in cellular models of PD. The comparative assessment provides new insights into the properties of α-syn antibodies and should aid in the design of next generation therapeutics for the treatment of PD and other synucleinopathies.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) involves systemic microvascular dysfunction, with choriocapillaris density (CCD) potentially reflecting it. This study examined whether a 24-week yoga intervention alters CCD in PD and whether responses differ by disease duration, severity, or intervention style.
Methods
Fifteen PD patients completed a supervised 24-week yoga program involving two Hatha-based styles. CCD was measured using 3 × 3 mm macular optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) centered on 2.5-mm foveal region. Clinical assessments included disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), conducted at baseline and after intervention. Correlation, stratified, and subgroup analyses were performed.
Results
No significant change in CCD was observed at the group level (62.9 % ± 3.9 % vs. 62.9 % ± 3.2 %; P > 0.05). Baseline CCD was inversely correlated with disease duration and H&Y stage (ρ = −0.71, P = 0.003). Patients with shorter disease duration (<5 years) or early-stage PD (H&Y stage 1) showed significant CCD reductions (ΔCCD = −4.7 %, P = 0.003; ΔCCD = −4.3 %, P = 0.002), whereas those with longer duration or advanced stage (H&Y 2–3) exhibited mild increases (ΔCCD = +2.3 %, ΔCCD = +2.8 %). Baseline CCD was inversely correlated with ΔCCD (ρ = −0.77, P < 0.001). CCD did not differ between the YogaCue and Hatha Yoga groups at baseline, follow-up, or in ΔCCD (P > 0.05).
Conclusions
These findings provide preliminary evidence that CCD responses to yoga vary with disease stage but not intervention style, suggesting a potential role for CCD as a vascular marker to inform individualized rehabilitation in PD.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Despite extensive research, the etiology of PD remains elusive, and current treatments focus primarily on symptomatic relief rather than disease modification.
Methods
The papers were searched in Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, PubMed Prime, Cochrane library, Sciencedirect and Google Scholar as web resources. This article includes information about tannins research and reviews in the treatment of PD. However, other paper related to CNS have been avoided.
Results
In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring the therapeutic potential of natural compounds, such as tannins, for the management of PD. Tannins, polyphenolic compounds found abundantly in various plant species, have demonstrated neuroprotective effects through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metal chelating properties. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of PD pathophysiology, existing treatment modalities, and the potential role of tannins in PD management. Additionally, recent advancements in the application of tannins, including in vitro and in vivo studies, clinical trials, and novel delivery systems, are discussed. Furthermore, challenges and future perspectives regarding the translation of tannin-based therapies into clinical practice are addressed.
Discussion
Overall, this review highlights the promising therapeutic potential of tannins in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and underscores the need for further research to elucidate their mechanisms of action and optimize their clinical efficacy.

Abstract: Background
This study investigated the subthalamic nucleus (STN) function and deep brain stimulation (DBS) effects on single-unit activity (SUA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with dysarthria.
Methods
After presurgical speech analysis, we recorded STN neuronal activities while PD patients (n = 16) articulated Chinese Pinyin consonants. The Pinyin consonants were categorized by the manner and place of articulation for SUA cluster analysis. The cohort was then divided into normal articulation and dysarthria groups based on diadochokinetic (DDK) assessments. The STN SUA patterns, represented by the mean firing rate (FR), peak time, and response intensity during articulation, were analyzed and compared between the two groups. Finally, a stimulation cohort of 7 PD patients was included to test articulation and SUA pattern changes following intraoperative DBS.
Results
Clustering analysis of STN neuronal firing patterns demonstrated that neurons encode articulation by grouping consonants with the same manner of articulation into distinct clusters. Using k-means clustering, we further classified SUAs into two waveform types: negative spikes (type 1) and positive spikes (type 2). Dysarthria patients exhibited an increased mean FR of type 1 spikes and a reduced response intensity of type 2 spikes. During intraoperative stimulation, PD patients showed accelerated DDK, accompanied by a decrease in type 1 mean FR and an increase in type 2 mean FR.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate the crucial role of the STN in consonant encoding and dysarthria at the single-unit level. Both SUA firing patterns in the STN and DDK performance can be modulated by DBS.

Abstract: Most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have sporadic form of the disease with a multifactorial etiology due to interactions between environmental conditions and the genetic constitution of the individuals. We have analyzed by APEX technology 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 19 genes related to cholecystokinin, serotonin, dopamine and opioid neurotransmission. Significant differences in the allele and genotype frequencies between the controls and PD patients were detected for four SNPs from three genes (serotonin 2A receptor (rs6311, P=0.043), Wolfram syndrome 1 (rs1801211, P=0.007), proopiomelanocortin (rs28930368, P=0.026 and rs2071345, P=0.027) genes). Two SNPs in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene were also associated with different clinical forms of PD. Our data suggest that at least three genes involved in neurotransmitter systems may have more specific role in genetic predisposition to PD.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Many studies have investigated early predictors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, evidence is sparse regarding specific and common predictors for these diseases. We aimed to identify medication use, health conditions, and blood biomarkers that might be associated with the risk of AD, PD, and ALS ten years later.
Methods
We conducted population-based nested case–control studies of AD, PD, and ALS using electronic medical records in Europe (France, the UK, and Sweden) and Australia. We retrieved data on medication use, diagnosed health conditions, and measured blood biomarkers from electronic medical records or biomedical cohorts. Conditional logistic regression models and meta-analysis were applied to assess the associations between these factors and the risk of receiving a diagnosis of AD, PD, or ALS.
Findings
We included a total of 149,642 AD cases (mean age: 79.1–81.2 years), 252,696 PD cases (73.2–75.9 years), and 27,533 ALS cases (64.4–69.6 years). The prescription of psychoanaleptics and nasal preparations was consistently associated with an increased risk of AD, PD, and ALS 5–10 years later. Constipation and use of related medications were associated with an increased risk of AD and PD, while diabetes and use of antidiabetics were associated with a reduced risk of ALS. A higher level of triglycerides was associated with a lower risk of AD, whereas a higher level of Apolipoprotein B was associated with a lower risk of PD, 5–10 years later.
Interpretation
Psychoanaleptics and nasal preparations may serve as common predictors for diagnosis of AD, PD, and ALS 5–10 years later. Conversely, the increased prevalence of constipation is specific to AD and PD, while the decreased prevalence of diabetes and use of antidiabetics is specific to ALS.

Abstract: Currently, the clinical drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD) only focus on motor symptoms, while non-motor symptoms like depression are usually neglected. Even though, the efficacy of existing neurotherapeutic drugs is extremely poor which is due to the blood brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, a biomimetic polydopamine carbon dots (PDA C-dots) at 2–4 nm was synthesized, while exosomes from macrophages were applied to encapsulate PDA C-dots for improving their BBB-crossing ability and inflammation-targeting effect. Importantly, the prepared PDA C-dots@Exosomes (PEs) significantly alleviated both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD mice. Further mechanism research revealed that PEs eliminated oxidant stress and alleviated neuroinflammation to restore the injured neurons. The content of α-syn was markedly reduced, and the neural viability was dramatically improved on the areas of substantia nigra, striata, and prefrontal cortex. In summary, this work reported a mild synthetic approach to produce a kind of PDA C-dots, which had a fantastic neuroprotective effect. After being encapsulated with exosomes of macrophages, the obtained PEs could be utilized as a neuroprotective drug with great penetration ability of BBB and targeting ability into inflammatory zone. The great therapeutic effect on both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD indicates that PEs could become a promising drug for PD treatment.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor coordination, leading to gait abnormalities. Early detection of PD is crucial for effective management and treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods often require invasive procedures or are performed when the disease has significantly progressed. Therefore, there is a need for noninvasive techniques that can identify early motor symptoms, particularly those related to gait.
Objective
The study aimed to develop a noninvasive approach for the early detection of PD by analyzing model-based gait features. The primary focus is on identifying subtle gait abnormalities associated with PD using kinematic characteristics.
Methods
Data were collected through controlled video recordings of participants performing the timed up and go (TUG) assessment, with particular emphasis on the turning phase. The kinematic features analyzed include shoulder distance, step length, stride length, knee and hip angles, leg and arm symmetry, and trunk angles. These features were processed using advanced filtering techniques and analyzed through machine learning methods to distinguish between normal and PD-affected gait patterns.
Results
The analysis of kinematic features during the turning phase of the TUG assessment revealed that individuals with PD exhibited subtle gait abnormalities, such as freezing of gait, reduced step length, and asymmetrical movements. The model-based features proved effective in differentiating between normal and PD-affected gait, demonstrating the potential of this approach in early detection.
Conclusions
This study presents a promising noninvasive method for the early detection of PD by analyzing specific gait features during the turning phase of the TUG assessment. The findings suggest that this approach could serve as a sensitive and accurate tool for diagnosing and monitoring PD, potentially leading to earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes.
