To overcome FOG and avoid the falls, a real-time accurate FOG detection or prediction system is desirable to trigger on-demand cues. In this study, we designed and implemented an in-place movement experiment for PD patients to provoke FOG and meanwhile acquired multimodal physiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and accelerometer signals. A multimodal model using brain activity from EEG and motion data from accelerometers was developed to improve FOG detection performance. In the detection of over 700 FOG episodes observed in the experiments, the multimodal model achieved 0.211 measured by Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) compared with the single-modal models (0.127 or 0.139).Clinical Relevance— This is the first study to use multimodal: EEG and accelerometer signal analysis in FOG detection, and an improvement was achieved.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-1990-8","10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9175288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9175288","","Accelerometers;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Merging;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Physiology;Signal analysis;Diseases","Accelerometry;Electroencephalography;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Parkinson Disease","12","","24","CCBY","27 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PD severity assessment based on a series of motor movements illustrated in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an important part of clinical PD diagnosis. However, the current quantifying method heavily relies on human observation, which is time-consuming and subjective. Therefore, automatic severity estimation stemming from machine learning methods is receiving an increasing amount of research attention. However, these advances are still limited by data availability and interpretability. In this paper, we release a large PD motor dataset of over 300 real PD patients collected under doctors’ instructions and propose a pipeline to automatically quantify the motor severity of PD in finger tapping and postural stability. These two selected movements are representative of local and global motor control, exhibiting great clinical importance. The pipeline contains three-stage: pose estimation, domain knowledge extraction, and classification stage. The pose estimation uses deep-learning-based methods to extract 21 and 17 key points for finger tapping and postural stability respectively. The domain knowledge extraction stage extracts several explicit features pre-defined by experienced neuro-physicians. Finally, a classifier is trained to infer PD severity under MDS-UPDRS. To combine deep-learning-based features from pose estimation and domain features from the expert, the pipeline achieves a better trade-off between the model efficiency and clinical interpretability. Experiments show that our method achieves a micro average f1-score of 88%, 84%, and 84%, respectively on left finger tapping, right finger tapping, and postural stability, outperforming previous methods by a large margin. In addition, involving expert knowledge in the feature extraction stage greatly improves our model’s interpretability, which is essential in automatic PD detection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3183232","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1313502); Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Macau S&T Program (Category C) of SZSTI(grant numbers:SGDX20201103094002009); University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2019-00056-AMSV,MYRG2020-00098-FST); The Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR(grant numbers:0144/2019/A3,0022/2020/AFJ,SKL-AMSV,SKL-AMSV-ADDITIONAL FUND,SKL-AMSV(UM)-2020-2022); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61761166004,81870888); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796513","Activity recognition;deep learning;finger tapping;neural network;Parkinson’s disease;pose estimation;postural stability","Feature extraction;Pose estimation;Traction motors;Stability criteria;Diseases;Thumb;Pipelines","","20","","50","CCBYNCND","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dopamine is responsible for the communication between parts of the brain associated with the control and fluency of body movements. Hence, the disease manifests with a spectrum of movement disorders as well as non-motor features. It is now revealed that the non-motor symptoms may show many years prior to the onset of motor symptoms. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to stop or slow down the progression of the disease in its tracks. In this context, ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithms like boosting algorithms can play a significant role in detecting Parkinson's Disease at an early stage. In this paper, four boosting algorithms are studied and implemented in UCI Parkinson's Disease dataset. After rigorous simulation, the ML models exhibited satisfactory results in terms of different performance parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score., AUC, Youden, specificity and error rate. However, the performances of the model are improved by tuning the hyperparameters with GridSearchCV. Hence, a detailed comparative analysis is portrayed where Light GBM displayed the highest accuracy of 93.39% after hyperparameter tuning. However, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting algorithm also depicted accuracies more than 90% but AdaBoost demonstrated maximum 87.22% accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.","","978-1-6654-4923-6","10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564108","Boosting Algorithm;Parkinson's disease (PD);UCI dataset;Predictive Analysis","Machine learning algorithms;Parkinson's disease;Tracking;Senior citizens;Production;Boosting;Prediction algorithms","","48","","34","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quantum computing, therefore, coupled with deep learning, seeks to improve the accuracy as well as efficiency of classifying traditional LSTM models, which even becomes more critical in cases of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, where diagnostics at an early stage would be helpful. The model was tested heavily on public datasets and compared with traditional deep learning models, which were significantly outperformed by this model with its superior accuracy and precision and recall rates. Furthermore, the computation time hugely became lower and thus possibly may revolutionize diagnostic procedures. These innovations will eventually establish quantum machine learning in medicine at a more accurate and faster diagnosis pace. Future development will focus on expanding the quantum LSTM so it can be more generally applicable to various situations for other medical conditions. Researchers believe that the configuration of the quantum layers should be modified, and this model will be extended to other deep learning models to have a more comprehensive and versatile tool in diagnosis for Parkinson's disease and perhaps other medical uses. The ultimate vision in the long term would be to use quantum-based models, not only for early detection but also improvement in prediction and personalization of treatment to revolutionize health care and thereby improve patient outcomes with neurodegenerative diseases.","","979-8-3315-1809-7","10.1109/ICICNIS64247.2024.10823156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10823156","Parkinson's disease diagnosis;Quantum LSTM;quantum computing in medicine;neurodegenerative diseases","Deep learning;Technological innovation;Quantum computing;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Long short term memory;Medical diagnostic imaging;Tuning","","3","","15","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These parameters are quantitative manner to scale the variations of functional tremors in normal control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). However, difficulty arises in using nonlinear polar expression features in the two-dimensional feature space to separate normal control subjects from those with PD and ET. To solve the nonlinear separable classification problem, hash transformation is used to map polar expression features to a high-dimensional space using hash weighing function and modulo operation. Then, a machine learning method, such as the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), is implemented to train a decision-making classifier using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for possible class assessment. With the enrolled data from 50 subjects, the fivefold cross validation, mean true positive, mean true negative, and mean hit rates of 98.93%, 98.96%, and 98.93%, respectively, are obtained to quantify the performance of the proposed decision-making classifier to identify normal controls and subjects with PD or ET.

However, kinematic gait parameter-driven vibrotactile cueing has not been explored yet. Kinematic gait parameter-driven cueing is more effective than temporal cueing, according to FoG pathophysiology studies. Therefore, we developed and pilot-tested a novel cueing scheme in which the foot-to-ground angle at heel strike (FGA_HS) is estimated using indigenous instrumented shoes to drive vibrotactile cueing. Ten PD freezers underwent a 6-meter timed walk test in the off-medication state with and without the cue and after medication without the cue. The proposed system potentially mitigated FoG, quantified by a reduction in the ratio of time spent freezing to the total walking time and the number of FoGs. The FoG mitigation potential of the cue was further supported by increased anteroposterior center of pressure progression and FGA_HS. With a future comprehensive validation in a larger number of participants, the novel cue could likely be used in practice and commercialized.","2329-4051","","10.1109/TOH.2024.3378917","Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India(grant numbers:TDP/BDTD/35/2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10478666","Parkinson's disease;freezing of gait;vibrotactile cue;wearable instrumentation","Visualization;Legged locomotion;Vibration measurement;Kinematics;Motors;Synchronization;Instruments;Parkinson's disease;Wearable devices;Instrumentation and measurement","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Pilot Projects;Cues;Male;Female;Aged;Middle Aged;Biomechanical Phenomena;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Vibration;Gait;Shoes","3","","63","IEEE","25 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The abnormal neural activity that underlies these symptoms is frequently not sufficiently treated by existing medicines, despite tremendous advancements in therapy. It could render traditional signal processing methods unsuitable for continuous, long-term use in implanted or wearable medical devices. The research suggests a novel VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) design that uses Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) transformation techniques to modulate neural activity in PD. To analyze and modify nerve activity, it makes use of a dataset of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that show neural activity in PD patients. The dataset includes time-series data and time-frequency characteristics. A band-pass filter was used to preprocess the EEG data in order to eliminate noise and unnecessary frequencies, maintaining the emphasis on the pertinent neural activity. The STFT was then used to extract features, which produced time-frequency representations that capture the EEG signals’ phase and amplitude information for additional examination. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to determine if a person has PD or not. The CNN uses its capacity to identify intricate patterns to interpret the retrieved STFT characteristics from the EEG data and make precise predictions. The performance for the proposed method is analyzed by accuracy, throughput, latency, and power consumption. The technology can precisely detect and alter the oscillatory patterns linked to PD by applying STFT+CNN to neural signals, thereby providing a way to implement more individualized and successful treatment approaches.","2768-6450","979-8-3315-1386-3","10.1109/ICBSII65145.2025.11013411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11013411","Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Electroencephalogram (EEG);Parkinson’s disease (PD);Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT);Very Large-Scale Integration) (VLSI)","Time-frequency analysis;Accuracy;Power demand;Neural activity;Very large scale integration;Throughput;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Convolutional neural networks;Diseases","","","","15","IEEE","29 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is powered by a microcontroller that controls servo motors in relation to real-time data from an accelerometer, ensuring the spoon head remains at a steady level, even if a user's hand is shaking or moving unpredictably. With this spoon, users are able to self-feed without any assistance, hence improving their quality of life.

This approach cannot reveal detailed information of foot loading dynamics and the cooperative relationships of different anatomical plantar foot areas when the subjects walk. By contrast, we propose a novel multivariate method for analyzing gait patterns of the PD patients: Gait Influence Diagrams (GIDs). These are constructed by analyzing the Wiener-Akaike-Granger- Schweder influences between vertical ground reaction force signals at different plantar areas of both feet. In this paper, we use the particular case of WAGS influence measures known as “extended Granger causality analysis”. GIDs are directed graphs, with arrows indicating those influences that are significantly different between PD patients and healthy subjects. We confirm prior clinical observations that Parkinsonian gait differs significantly from the healthy one in the anterior-posterior movement direction. A new finding is that there are also pathological changes in the lateral-medial direction. Importantly, gait asymmetry for the PD patients is clearly evident in GIDs, even in earlier stages of the disease. These results suggest that GID might be of use in future PD gait pattern studies.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2622285","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:81601585); University of Electronic Science and Technology of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723863","Contemporaneous effects;extended Granger causality (eGC);gait;gait asymmetry;gait influence diagram (GID);Granger causality (GC);linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM);multivariate analysis;Parkinson’s disease (PD);rehabilitation;stance;structural equation model (SEM);vertical ground reaction force (VGRF);Wiener–Akaike–Granger–Schweder (WAGS) influence","Foot;Time series analysis;Diseases;Legged locomotion;Force;Sensors;Indexes","Aged;Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Neurological;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Parkinson Disease;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","11","","67","IEEE","27 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

OpenPose is a deep learning tool for human pose estimation. However, few studies have focused only on gait arm swing and analyzed it separately from that of healthy subjects. Furthermore, none of the previous studies compared arm swing data measured from video images using OpenPose or other methods with the relevant items in the MDS-UPDRS. In this study, we calculated the thresholds to distinguish between normal and abnormal gaits from the data of healthy subjects. We compared the peak-to-peak (P-P) data of the left and right arm swing and arm swing asymmetry (ASA) using an OpenPose-based gait analysis system developed in our previous study with the MDS-UPDRS scores. It showed 72.73–82.35% accuracy; thus, the threshold between normal and abnormal gaits can be improved. From these results, we can conclude that there is a significant relationship between the MDS-UPDRS score and the magnitude of the gait arm swing angle measured using the OpenPose-based gait analysis system. The method proposed in this study is simpler and easier to use in clinical practice than the methods proposed in previous studies. Moreover, videos of timed up-and-go (TUG) tests can be used.

Our project involved two stages of research: an initial study that explored the overall acceptability and responses of people with Parkinson's to the technology; and a follow-up study that examined participants’ experiences of the technology in more depth through further trials and a series of co-design activities. While our first trials were successful, leading to publication and subsequent local and national publicity, our follow-up trials were hampered by technical problems that were often out of our control. We highlight how participants’ heightened expectations prior to the second trial, as a result of public discourse around the project, were difficult to meet. This led to our participants articulating their frustrations, feelings of lowered self-confidence, and in some cases a reduced sense of self-worth. We reflect on how the decisions and actions taken during the project led to these dilemmas, and how these relate to contemporary challenges in human-computer interaction research where there is increased focus on in the wild studies of technology use and a pressure to publicly disseminate the findings of research. In doing so, we offer an open and honest account of how a set of ethical dilemmas emerged while conducting technology field trials with a potentially vulnerable group, and offer guidance to future researchers finding themselves in similar circumstances. We conducted ‘in the wild’ deployments of Google Glass with people with Parkinson's. There were several ethical implications of conducting this type of research, wherein the technology in question was still being developed and updated by its commercial manufacturer. Prior publicity about our project caused participants to formulate overly positive preconceptions around the technology. We reflect in detail on some of the decisions and actions taken during the project, and discuss strategies for researchers to take into account in future studies that might help anticipate, avoid and negotiate ethical dilemmas in the future.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iww017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155241","health care;assistive technologies;user studies;user experience design;ethics;Parkinson's","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

However, current facial expression-based PD diagnosis methods are hindered by limited training data on PD patients' facial expressions and weak prediction models. To address these issues, we propose a new PD diagnosis method that utilizes facial expression data augmentation and deep neural network prediction. Our approach involves two stages: 1) generating virtual facial expression images depicting six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise) through multi-domain adversarial learning to expand the original training data; 2) training a deep neural network prediction model using a combination of the augmented training data from PD patients and facial expression images of normal individuals from public datasets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm the efficacy of our multi-domain adversarial learning-based facial expression synthesis and demonstrate the promising performance of our proposed approach for PD diagnosis.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-4485-1","10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10447406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10447406","Parkinson's disease diagnosis;facial expression data augmentation;adversarial learning","Training;Parkinson's disease;Training data;Artificial neural networks;Predictive models;Signal processing;Data augmentation","","3","","32","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we analyze the performance of three deep architectures in the context of classifying PD from vocal features: CNN, RNN, and a combined architecture that uses both RNN combined with LSTM networks. We preprocess the data using the normalization method and perform train-test splitting for training our dataset. Each model is architected and trained with specific architectural choices to try to capture the underlying patterns in data. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score that are used to evaluate the performance of these models. Preliminary results indicate that RNN + LSTM outperforms other architectures concerning accuracy and robustness, hence indicating its superior suitability for classifying time-series for PD detection purposes.

Early detection of PD is indispensable for slowing down its progress and providing the possibility to access the therapy. Therefore, the research focus on developing a hybrid framework (XGBRF) utilizing XGBoost and random forests to enhance the accuracy of predicting the PD is proposed. It is hypothesized that the proposed framework will benefit from this complementary characteristic by using RF's strength in variance reduction through bagging and XGBoost on bias minimization through boosting. This research was tested on publicly available datasets using cross-validation with hyper-parameter tuning for the optimization of optimal performance. In comparison, the proposed framework results in higher accuracy rate of 0.97, precision of 0.92, F1 score of 0.96 and AUC-ROC value of 0.93 than the existing classifiers.

Currently, the most widely used clinical scale for the assessment of tremor is the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). However, this type of assessment carries limitations, such as its subjectivity and dependence on experienced evaluators. These problems can be overcome by using inertial sensors for objective measurements of movement. Therefore, a serious game called RehaBEElitation for upper limbs was developed, with which users interact using a glove composed of inertial and resistive sensors. This study aimed to evaluate tremor objectively using the RehaBEElitation. Fifteen individuals with PD and fifteen healthy individuals interacted with the game, constituting the experimental group (EG) and control group (CG), respectively, matched in age and sex. Data collection was performed in the ON and OFF states of medication for the EG. Tremor was detected by removing the trend from the original signal and was assessed by estimating the Mean Absolute Value (MAV), Root Mean Square (RMS) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the gyroscope signals. The probability that the peak frequencies of the PD-OFF signals fall within the frequency range of Parkinson's tremor (4–7 Hz) was higher than for the PD-ON group, which in turn was higher than for CG. For both MAV and RMS, the chance that the distribution having a bimodal aspect, which represents the presence of PD tremor, was higher for the EG in the ON and OFF states than for the CG. The PD-OFF group had the highest probability of having the highest peak power in the signal than the other groups. In summary, MAV and RMS showed strong correlation with MDS-UPDRS. The RehaBEElitation serious game is an alternative tool to assess hand tremor objectively and playfully. The EG participants in the OFF state presented more tremor compared to the ON state.","","979-8-3503-0080-2","10.1109/MetroXRAINE58569.2023.10405668","National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)(grant numbers:CAPES/DFATD-88887.159028/2017-00,CAPES/COFECUB-88881.370894/2019-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10405668","Parkinson's disease;tremor;objective evaluation;gyroscope;serious game","Neurological diseases;Parkinson's disease;Neural engineering;Games;Metrology;Motion measurement;Root mean square","","2","","27","IEEE","1 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) and levodopa are two popular treatments that frequently don't give patients consistent comfort. The goal of this project is to create a novel EEG-based brain stimulation user interface that is especially intended to control rigidity in Parkinson's disease patients. The suggested method uses high-fidelity electrodes that are Bluetooth-connected to transfer data in real-time while capturing EEG signals from the motor cortical regions. The main goal of signal processing is to extract power spectral information from the frequency bands of $a$ (alpha), β (beta), and θ (theta). The β band is especially noteworthy because of its strong correlation with stiffness and motor control. The intensity of stiffness is divided into three categories by machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). This classification optimizes treatment settings for individualized therapy by facilitating adaptive brain stimulation and real-time therapeutic decision-making. The closed-loop system continually analyses EEG readings, categorizes the degree of rigidity, and modifies stimulation parameters in real time. Interviews with 10 physicians, including neurologists and neurosurgeons, were done in order to validate the method. High suggestibility was revealed by the response, provided that safety precautions and ethical clearances are properly followed. The goal of this comprehensive approach is to improve the precision and effectiveness of treating rigidity in Parkinson's disease (PD) by addressing the variability in present treatments. Through the utilization of forefront machine learning techniques and live EEG monitoring, the suggested interface presents a viable, non-invasive method for enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.","2573-3028","979-8-3503-8340-9","10.1109/IECBES61011.2024.10991333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10991333","Parkinson's Disease;Rigidity;Brain Stimulation;Beta Band;Power Spectral Density;Real-time Monitoring;Personalized Therapy","Support vector machines;Parkinson's disease;User interfaces;Signal processing;Nearest neighbor methods;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems;Rigidity;Safety;Brain stimulation","","","","20","IEEE","19 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classification and clinical score prediction are performed jointly to facilitate early PD diagnosis. Specifically, the proposed approach performs united embedding and sparse regression, which can determine the similarity matrices and discriminative features adaptively. Meanwhile, we constrain the similarity matrix among subjects and exploit the  ${l}_{\mathrm {2,p}}$  norm to conduct sparse adaptive control for obtaining the intrinsic information of the multimodal data structure. An effective iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. We perform abundant experiments on the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data set to verify the validity of the proposed approach.

This device is an instrumented walker, which provides a quantitative measure of gait and has been proven to assess a patient's condition. The preliminary study involved 20 PD patients whose disease severity was determined by Hoehn and Yahr (H & Y) scores ranging between 2 and 3. The subjects performed a 3m walking clinical protocol, whilst pushing the walker and a variety of kinematic motion signals are recorded. Signal pre­processing techniques are applied and a total of 21 features extracted from the signals acquired by the device. Based on the clinical relevance determined by the neurologists, five features were selected and normalized using a z-score. The average values of these features across the cohort indicated improvement to gait features pre and post Amantadine. However, a significant intra-class variability was observed with approximately 60% of subjects showing response to treatment, whereas other patients improved very little or even declined in terms of these features. Dividing the cohort into 2 groups based on severity yielded that patients with higher H & Y scores (greater PD severity) showed a more significant response in their gait features. Whilst, a larger study is required to validate these results, this preliminary study illustrates the potential of the device to quantitatively assess treatment effect in PD patients based on gait feature changes.","","978-1-5386-5135-3","10.1109/EBBT.2018.8391457","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8391457","Amantadine;gait;PAMMII;Parkinson's Disease;signal processing","Legged locomotion;Diseases;Acceleration;Protocols;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Accelerometers","","2","","9","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In both disorders, doctors diagnose patients related to clinical evaluations during such hospital visits, leading to misdiagnosis. Machine Learning (ML) is being used to classify the ET and PST using human-based feature extraction to address this issue. Motivated by this, we applied Deep Learning (DL) to overcome the ML issue via automating feature extraction through the model itself.

Initially, accelerometer sensors are used to record tremors in all three axial dimensions for each subject. Further, this data is pre-processed using the standard scalar function and scaled in-unit variance. Furthermore, this data first passed through the GRU model, and later it fed into the LSTM model to improve the model’s performance.

With this in mind, we built a system for portable monitoring of neurological disorders in humans. The system analyzes movement signals from distributed wirelessly connected gyroscopes and accelerometers using a commercial smartphone, off-the-shelf attachments, and custom-programmed software. With approval from the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board, we conducted a study with human subjects to evaluate whether unsupervised remote mobile monitoring might be possible with such a system, and, if so, how accurately the system could assess the signs of Parkinson's disease. We found that it was useful to consider data from multiple sensors in order to discriminate between normal and parkinsonian movement and that it was possible to identify activity types from the accelerometer and gyroscope data with high accuracy (1.0).

Currently, numerous experimental and computational strategies exist for targeting beta (12-35Hz) oscillations in treatment models. These approaches primarily rely on monitoring beta wave activity within the normal range as a biomarker to mitigate abnormalities, alongside utilizing somatic and manual states to address resting tremors. However, within current DBS methodologies, the utilization of theta band activity as a biomarker is limited, with beta band biomarkers predominantly employed. This study introduces a novel approach: instead of solely relying on theta band power thresholds, we propose using the ratio of theta band power to low beta band power as a criterion for adaptive deep brain stimulation. The experimental results demonstrate that using this ratio as the threshold can effectively inhibit resting tremor and reduce the thalamocortex relay (TC) value from 0.48 to 0.08. And the energy consumption is 86% compared with traditional deep brain stimulation. This finding suggests that this value as a biomarker may be very effective for the treatment of resting tremor.","","979-8-3315-3089-1","10.1109/CAIT64506.2024.10963311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10963311","Deep brain stimulation;Parkinson’s disease;tremor","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Deep brain stimulation;Brain modeling;Turning;Relays;Oscillators;Spectral analysis;Diseases","","","","23","IEEE","17 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 upsurges kinase activity, targeting molecules concomitant with apoptosis, and is a mutual genetic cause. LRRK2's involvement in various neurodegenerative diseases and cancer highlights its probable as a therapeutic target. Abnormal LRRK2 activity affects mitochondrial function, autophagy, and neurological inflammation. Targeting LRRK2 offers an exclusive opportunity to address multiple pathways in Parkinson's development. Screening 3,674 FDA-approved drugs for their affinity to LRRK2 identified Ponatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor initially developed for leukemia treatment, as a favourable candidate. Ponatinib's ability to modify LRRK2 activity and potentially offer neuroprotection makes it an attractive option for Parkinson's prophylaxis. Physicochemical analysis via SWISS-ADME supports Ponatinib's suitability. This analysis suggests Ponatinib's repositioning as a PD prophylactic by targeting LRRK2. Further studies are necessitated to investigate its efficacy in preventing Parkinson's disease.","","979-8-3315-4158-3","10.1109/I3CEET61722.2024.10993568","Delhi Technological University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10993568","LRRK2;Parkinson’s Disease;Ponatinib;G2019S;Molecular Docking;Drug re-purposing","Drugs;Visualization;Parkinson's disease;Inhibitors;Pathogenesis;Leukemia;Pressing;Telecommunication computing;Permeability;Compounds","","","","17","IEEE","13 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Today, clinical diagnosis is the main diagnostic method of Parkinson's disease, but the diagnosis results are not ideal, especially in the early stage of the disease. In this paper, a Parkinson's auxiliary diagnosis algorithm based on a hyperparameter optimization method of deep learning is proposed for the Parkinson's diagnosis. The diagnosis system uses ResNet50 to achieve feature extraction and Parkinson's classification, mainly including speech signal processing part, algorithm improvement part based on Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC) and optimizing the hyperparameters of ResNet50 part. The improved algorithm is called Gbest Dimension Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (GDABC), proposing “Range pruning strategy” which aims at narrowing the scope of search and “Dimension adjustment strategy” which is to adjust gbest dimension by dimension. The accuracy of the diagnosis system in the verification set of Mobile Device Voice Recordings at King's College London (MDVR-CKL) dataset can reach more than 96%.

This work develops flexible wearable sensors that can detect FoG and alert patients and companions to help prevent falls. FoG is detected on the sensors using a deep learning (DL) model with multi-modal sensory inputs collected from distributed wireless sensors. Two types of wireless sensors are developed, including: 1) a C-shape central node placed around the patient's ears, which collects electroencephalogram (EEG), detects FoG using an on-device DL model, and generates auditory alerts when FoG is detected; 2) a stretchable patch-type sensor attached to the patient's legs, which collects electromyography (EMG) and movement information from accelerometers. The patch-type sensors wirelessly send collected data to the central node through low-power ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers. All sensors are fabricated on flexible printed circuit boards. Adhesive gel-free acetylene carbon black and polydimethylsiloxane electrodes are fabricated on the flexible substrate to allow conformal wear over the long term. Custom integrated circuits (IC) are developed in 180 nm CMOS technology and used in both types of sensors for signal acquisition, digitization, and wireless communication. A novel lightweight DL model is trained using multi-modal sensory data. The inference of the DL model is performed on a low-power microcontroller in the central node. The DL model achieves a high detection sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.88. The developed wearable sensors are ready for clinical experiments and hold great promise in improving the quality of life of patients with PD. The proposed design methodologies can be used in wearable medical devices for the monitoring and treatment of a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2023.3281596","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN-2022-04957); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138807","Flexible sensors;low-power bioelectronics;edge deep learning (DL);Parkinson's disease (PD);freezing of gait (FoG);wireless sensor network (WSN)","Sensors;Electroencephalography;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Low-power electronics;Deep learning;Parkinson's disease","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Deep Learning;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Quality of Life;Gait","26","","47","IEEE","31 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a mobile solution for home-based assessment of RAS by combining RAS gait training and a mobile system for data acquisition. Existing datasets were used to investigate the cadence of PD patients and to propose suitable frequencies for RAS gait training. The cadence calculation was implemented using a peak detection algorithm, which uses the time difference between two mid-swing events as stride time values. We validated our system as a whole using a cohort of 13 PD patients who performed RAS gait training. The algorithms were also validated against the eGaIT system, a state-of-the-art system, and achieved a mean F1 score for detected strides of 97.57 % ± 0.86 % and a mean absolute error for the cadence of 0.16 spm ± 0.09 spm.

However, sensor data collected in daily life reflect multiple health and behavior-related factors together. This creates the need for a structured principled analysis to produce reliable and interpretable predictions that can be used to support clinical diagnosis and treatment. In this work we develop a principled modelling approach for free-living gait (walking) analysis. Gait is a promising target for non-obtrusive monitoring because it is common and indicative of many different movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), yet its analysis has largely been limited to experimentally controlled lab settings. To locate and characterize stationary gait segments in free-living using accelerometers, we present an unsupervised probabilistic framework designed to segment signals into differing gait and non-gait patterns. We evaluate the approach using a new video-referenced dataset including 25 PD patients with motor fluctuations and 25 age-matched controls, performing unscripted daily living activities in and around their own houses. Using this dataset, we demonstrate the framework's ability to detect gait and predict medication induced fluctuations in PD patients based on free-living gait. We show that our approach is robust to varying sensor locations, including the wrist, ankle, trouser pocket and lower back.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2020.3037857","Michael J.

The identification of Parkinson's disease (PD) results in mistakes, huge amounts of medical expenses, and could cause trouble for the patients. Telemonitoring is using technology to remotely diagnose, treat, or consult with a patient. This addresses the problems with the clinical verification of Parkinson's illness. Patients with this illness may get treatment based on their motor-related symptoms, voice fluctuations from speech processing, or CAD-based image processing. Voice has lately been found to function as a biomarker for several neurological illnesses [1][12]. So, to reduce the risk and detect the disease at an early stage, we are trying to create a model using speech features and machine learning techniques. In order to detect the people suffering with Parkinson’s disease, we propose to use various techniques like Naïve Bayes, SVM, KNN, and Decision tree classifier. Such models can help people in the medical field to identify if an individual is affected by Parkinson’s disease at an early stage.

Int his work, a new approach that exploits the combination of Gaussian Blur, Canny Edge Detection, Morphological Closing, and Modified Yen's Thresholding. The framework seeks to enhance the accuracy and reliability of PD analysis through a better fixed boundary separation of precise images. The preliminary processing step of Gaussian Blur is introduced to reduce noise and smoothen the image, at the same time as Canny Edge Detection is employed to discover edges correctly within the picture. Morphological Closing is a manner that makes the edges smoother through connecting the disconnected edges. Moreover, Modified Yen's Thresholding, a dynamic thresholding technique, determines the top-quality threshold values based on the neighborhood versions of depth, accordingly, it improves the accuracy of feature detection and segmentation. The evaluation of the proposed scheme becomes achieved on a dataset which covered 78 MRI scans and DaT Scans.

Approximately 10 million people worldwide are affected by PD. However, accurate diagnosis of PD is still challenging in the early stages of this disease due to the similarity of the phenotypes of the neurological disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played an important role in understanding brain function and disease in neuroimaging. In particular, it can detect structural abnormalities in the brain caused by dopamine deprivation in PD patients leading to excitation-inhibition imbalance. Besides, the utilization of deep learning has emerged as a crucial factor in the identification of Parkinson’s disease due to its ability to identify irregularities, and structural changes at a specific location of brain. This study investigates the effectiveness of the deep learning model EfficientNet-V2 in combination with transfer learning for the purpose of identifying the presence or absence of Parkinson’s disease in individuals. In contrast to the arbitrary scaling employed by conventional CNN, the EfficientNet-V2 employs a straightforward and efficient compound factor to modify the network dimensions, which facilitates the identification of the optimal set of parameters. The identification is made by analyzing MRI samples obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative, an openly accessible dataset.

Most current methods for assessing FOG severity often overlook the interpretability of the extracted gait features. In this study, we design a multimodal gait feature dataset with rich physical significance, including kinematics, kinetics, and spatiotemporal modalities. We also propose a graph-based multimodal fusion framework (GMFF) to accurately quantify FOG severity. GMFF employs the graph attention mechanism to extract modality-specific features and utilizes the generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) algorithm as the core of the feature fusion module. We provide the double-hurdle output module to address the impact of the zero-inflation problem on the performance of GMFF. We evaluate the performance of GMFF on a public PD gait database using five-fold cross-validation. The results demonstrate that GMFF achieves an accuracy of 0.978 in identifying patients with FOG and a root mean square error of 0.449 in quantifying FOG severity. Using the interpretability of GMFF, we identify the gait feature set that effectively characterizes the gait patterns of PD patients and then explore the impact of FOG symptoms on their walking ability under both the “ON” and “OFF” medication states. Thus, this study has the potential to provide valuable insights into the clinical monitoring and management of PD patients.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2025.3561942","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFC3601200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62203441,U21A20479); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4252055,L222013); Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:2023YFDZ0042); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10967365","Parkinson’s disease;freezing of gait;gait analysis;quantification assessment;multimodal features fusion;medication states","Feature extraction;Kinematics;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Kinetic theory;Legged locomotion;Diseases;Databases;Accuracy;Harmonic analysis;Force","Humans;Parkinson Disease;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Algorithms;Reproducibility of Results;Male;Female;Biomechanical Phenomena;Aged;Databases, Factual;Middle Aged;Gait Analysis;Sensitivity and Specificity;Gait","1","","33","CCBY","17 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It usually strikes the elderly and is caused by significant damage to nerve cells that impairs mobility and day-to-day activities. Initial symptoms may include involuntary tremors and shivering in the hands, making it difficult for the patient to do daily activities like eating from a bowl. With the help of the provided utensil, this work essentially provides a non-invasive method that enables the patient to consume the food. A working prototype for a stabilizing spoon was created with the goal of serving as a supplement for individuals who require aid when eating. The suggested system is constructed using sensor, Controller and actuator as a significant element. This was made feasible by the employment of a sensor that integrated accelerometers and gyroscopes to determine the direction and rate of tilt of the device’s handle. Two servo motors are set up orthogonal to one another to give two axes of freedom in order to develop a system The spoon was intended to maintain its utensil basin horizontal using this method. The work revealed that the spoon’s vertical and horizontal accelerations vary significantly depending on the type of food, with dry food showing a mean vertical acceleration of $15.1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$ and horizontal acceleration of $12.89 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$, whereas wet food demonstrates higher variability in vertical acceleration (mean of $15.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$) and lower mean horizontal acceleration $\left(8.95 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}\right.$). This indicates the spoon’s movement is more consistent with dry food and more erratic with wet food. The spoon is designed with precise dimensions $(27 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length, 9 cm in width, and 1 mm in thickness) and a total weight of 130 gm, which are optimized for comfortable and effective use by Parkinson’s patients. The measurements ensure the spoon’s stability and usability.","2473-7674","979-8-3503-7024-9","10.1109/ICCCNT61001.2024.10726044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10726044","Calibration;Gyroscope;IMU;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;Sensor Networks;Stabilization","Neurological diseases;Neurons;Prototypes;Psychology;Power distribution;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Servomotors;Usability;Older adults","","1","","11","IEEE","4 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This tutorial aims to demonstrate the procedure to choose a suitable interpretationmethod for the PD recogni-tion model. We exhibit four DCNN architectures as an example and introduce six well-known interpretationmethods. Finally, we propose an evaluation method to measure the interpretation performance and a method to use the interpreted feedback for assisting in model selection. The evaluation demonstrates that the guided backpropagation and SHAP interpretation methods are suitable for PD recognition methods in different aspects. Guided backpropagation has the best ability to show fine-grained importance, which is proven by the highest Dice coefficient and lowest mean square error. On the other hand, SHAP can generate a better quality heatmap at the uptake depletion location, which outperforms other methods in discriminating the difference between PD and NC subjects. Shortly, the introduced interpretationmethods can contribute to not only the PD recognition application but also to sensor data processing in an AI Era (interpretable-AI) as feedback in constructing well-suited deep learning architectures for specific applications.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3077949","PTT Public Company Ltd.; Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) Public Company Ltd.; ThailandScience Research and Innovation(grant numbers:SRI62W1501); Office of National Higher Education Science Research and Innovation Policy Council(grant numbers:C10F630057); Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database; Michael J.

Until now, there has been no antidote for PD. However, diagnosing Parkinson’s disease in its early stages is difficult. Early treatment will help people with Parkinson’s disease improve their quality of life. The primary goal of this work is to increase the early diagnostic accuracy of Parkinson’s disease using deep learning models and to make the models more transparent and trustworthy. It proved challenging to comprehend the methods by which the classifiers made predictions about Parkinson’s disease. It would be valuable if the outcomes generated by these classifiers could be clarified in a reliable and trustworthy manner. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (EXAI) focuses on enhancing clinical health practises and bringing transparency to predictive analysis, both of which are critical in the healthcare arena.

Five inertial measurement units attached to the wrist, ankle, and waist are used to collect motion data from 100 subjects during a 10-meter walking test. The raw data of each sensor are subjected to the continuous wavelet transform to train the classification model of the constructed 6-channel convolutional neural network (CNN). The results show that the sensor located at the waist has the best classification performance with an accuracy of 98.01%±0.85% and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9981±0.0017 under ten-fold cross-validation. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping shows that the feature points with greater contribution to PD were concentrated in the lower frequency band (0.5~3Hz) compared with healthy controls. The visual maps of the 3D CNN show that only three out of the six time series have a greater contribution, which is used as a basis to further optimize the model input, greatly reducing the raw data processing costs (50%) while ensuring its performance (AUC=0.9929±0.0019).

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been the primary target for DBS in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, changes in the spike firing patterns and spectral power of local field potentials (LFPs) in the pre-STN (zona incerta, ZI) and post-STN (cerebral peduncle, cp) regions were investigated in PD rats, providing crucial evidence for the functional localization of the STN. Sixteen-channel microelectrode arrays (MEAs) with sites distributed at different depths and widths were utilized to record neuronal activities. The spikes in the STN exhibited higher firing rates than those in the ZI and cp. Furthermore, the LFP power in the delta band in the STN was the greatest, followed by that in the ZI, and was greater than that in the cp. Additionally, increased LFP power was observed in the beta bands in the STN. To identify the best performing classification model, we applied various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on transfer learning to analyze the recorded raw data, which were processed using the Gram matrix of the spikes and the fast Fourier transform of the LFPs. The best transfer learning model achieved an accuracy of 95.16%. After fusing the spike and LFP classification results, the time precision for processing the raw data reached 500 ms.

Among these, speech and voice-related issues, collectively known as Parkinson's-related voice or speech disorders, are common and significantly affect patients' communication abilities. Resting tremors, a hallmark symptom of Parkinson's, can affect the vocal cords, causing a shaky or trembling voice. Patients often exhibit reduced volume, speaking softly and making it challenging for others to hear them. Additionally, some individuals may experience stuttering or stammering as a result of the disease's impact on speech control. To address the challenge of timely identification of Parkinson's disease, it has been brought forward to use a multilayer neural network that utilizes machine learning models and a curated dataset by Max Little. This system employs meticulous feature selection of the voice signals and data preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance. Among the various machine learning methods explored, the Multilayer Neural Network stands out, achieving exceptional training and testing accuracy rates of 100.00% and 98.43 %, particularly excelling in distinguishing between positive and negative cases. The effectiveness of this method demonstrates the capability of machine learning to enhance the initial identification and therapy of Parkinson's disease. It offers a powerful tool for healthcare professionals and researchers, aiding in patient care and advancing our understanding of this complex condition.

Results: Models accuracy ranged between 70.42-88.73% (AUC: 78.4-94.5%) with a sensitivity of 72.84-90.12% and a specificity of 60.3-86.89%. Signal-based digital gait characteristics independently gave 87.32% accuracy. The most influential characteristics in the classification models were related to root mean square values, power spectral density, step velocity and length, gait regularity and age. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of signal-based gait characteristics in the development of tools to help classify PD in the early stages of the disease.","2644-1276","","10.1109/OJEMB.2020.2966295","European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation ITN; Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:721577); Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking (JU)(grant numbers:820820); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and EFPIA; Parkinson's UK(grant numbers:J-0802,G-1301); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8964569","Classification;Machine Learning;Digital Gait;Parkinson's disease;Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Tools;Accelerometers;Parkinson's disease;Data models;Complexity theory","","46","","50","CCBY","22 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While wearable sensors have shown promise in tremor detection, current methods struggle to accurately classify slight tremors, a critical indicator for early diagnosis. To address this, we first learn informative spatial-temporal representations from tremor signals using Fast Continuous Wavelet Transform (FCWT). Then the learned representations are fed into advanced machine learning models to extract spatial features and capture temporal dependencies, enhancing classification accuracy across all tremor intensities. We evaluate the proposed method on a real-world dataset comprising 14 Parkinson’s disease patients and 450 clinically labeled tremor events. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 97.3% classification accuracy and a 64.7% improvement in F1 score compared to the baselines. By enabling an accurate and robust classification of slight tremors, our system offers potential in the early diagnosis and management of Parkinson’s disease.CCS Concepts• Applied computing → Health informatics.","2832-2975","979-8-4007-1539-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11121130","Tremor Detection;Parkinson’s Disease;Spatial-Temporal Learningm;Wearable Sensors","Accuracy;Continuous wavelet transforms;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Bioinformatics;Wearable sensors;Monitoring;Diseases","","","","19","CCBY","19 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The breakdown or death of brain cells responsible for producing dopamine, a neurotransmitter that regulates movement, causes this condition. Issues with mobility, equilibrium, and posture are brought on by PD, which develops as a result of this. To lessen the disease’s course and boost patients’ quality of life, early diagnosis is essential. A cosine annealing scheduler and deep transfer learning are presented in this study as a method for handwriting-based prediction. It uses handwriting samples from people with and without Parkinson’s disease, found in the NIATS collection. With the use of spiral sketching and CNN, this research hopes to provide a PD detection method. The main concept is to determine whether a person is healthy or has Parkinson’s disease based on their spiral drawings. Spiral drawings made by individuals in good health resemble conventional spiral forms. People with Parkinson’s disease have sluggish movement and poor hand-brain coordination, therefore their spiral drawings seem deformed because they stray greatly from the correct curve. This research presents the results of using a Convolutional Neural Network to diagnose Parkinson’s disease; the classification accuracy achieved was 83.6%.","","979-8-3503-8891-6","10.1109/GCCIT63234.2024.10862348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10862348","Spiral Drawing;Parkinson’s Disease Convolution Neural Network;artificial intelligence;deep transfer learning;data augmentation;neurological disorders","Hands;Spirals;Accuracy;Neurotransmitters;Transfer learning;Information and communication technology;Convolutional neural networks;Diseases;Overfitting;Image classification","","","","15","IEEE","6 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among many biomarkers, speech abnormalities have become a potential sign of PD as the disease affects the motor control of the vocal point. Therefore, speech data is a convenient, non-invasive, and valuable diagnostic tool. This work presents a novel methodology for classifying the severity stage of parkinson’s disease using speech data, addressing a notable deficiency in existing research works that have focused on binary classification. Stage classification distinguishes PD’s early, mid, and late phases, offering essential insights for stage-specific therapy strategies. We proposed a Parkinson’s Speech Stage-Net model (PSS-Net) for the prediction of the severity of PD that includes Isolation Forest-based outlier detection and removal, KMeansSMOTE data balancing, and Optimized Dimensionality Reduction techniques. The essential speech features were found using a tree-based feature selection method. Selected features are fed into the Optimized and Fused Neural Network model. The proposed model effectively classified the stages of PD with an accuracy of 89%. Moreover, this research study stresses openness using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand feature contributions, thereby improving the clinical relevance and credibility of the model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3597851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11122434","Parkinson’s disease;deep learning;explainable artificial intelligence;stage classification;speech biomarker;KMeansSMOTE","Diseases;Deep learning;Accuracy;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Principal component analysis;Motors;Data models;Medical treatment;Forestry","","","","56","CCBY","11 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several computerized decision support systems for PD dysgraphia have been proposed, however, the associated challenges require new approaches for more accurate diagnosis. Therefore, this work adds spectral and cepstral handwriting features to the already-used temporal, kinematic and statistics handwriting features. First, we calculate temporal and kinematic features using displacement; statistic features  $\left ({SF }\right)$  using displacement, and horizontal and vertical displacement; spectral  $\left ({SDF }\right)$  and cepstral  $\left ({CDF }\right)$  using displacement, horizontal and vertical displacement and pressure. Since the employed dataset (PaHaW) contains only 37 PD patients and 38 healthy control subjects (HC), then as the second step, we augment the percentage of the smaller training set to equal the larger. Next, we augment both classes to increase the training patient’s data and added random Gaussian noise in all augmentations. Third, the most relevant features were selected using the modified fast correlation-based filtering method (mFCBF). Finally, autoML is employed to train and test more than ten plain and ensembled classifiers. Experimental results show that adding spectral and cepstral features to temporal, kinematics and statistics features highly improved classification accuracy to 98.57%. Our proposed model, with lower computational complexities, outperforms conventional state-of-the-art models for all tasks, which is 97.62%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119035","MINECO Spanish(grant numbers:PID2020-113242RB-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9565915","Parkinson’s disease;dysgraphia;online handwriting;feature extraction;data augmentation;autoML","Kinematics;Support vector machines;Task analysis;Diseases;Data models;Spirals;Convolutional neural networks","","15","","44","CCBY","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main purpose of the acquisition, the device to record it, as well as preprocessing and analysis methods, were analyzed. Methodological quality was assessed using the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklist. Twenty-four studies with 940 participants were included. Eighteen acquired the electrodermal activity (EDA), and six the electrochemical skin conductance (ESC). These measures were used as a diagnostic tool to assess autonomic and/or sudomotor disfunction, under-stand decision-making and learning processes and detect gait freezing or nonmotor fluctuations. Fourteen devices recorded EDA and one ESC. Most studies did not preprocess the EDA/ESC signals or apply simple analyses. The EDA was analyzed only in the temporal domain in 23 studies. Analysis of the ESC signal was very limited. Moderate methodological quality was found. There is large heterogeneity not only in the devices to capture skin conductance but also in the signal processing methods. Clinical application of EDA/ESC could be of great value in detecting nonmotor fluctuations or correlating with other observations, but the lack of normative values makes it difficult.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2023.3321209","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(grant numbers:PID2020-113222RBC21/AEI/10.13039/501100011033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10273804","Biosignals;electrochemical skin conductance (ESC);electrodermal activity (EDA);Parkinson’s disease (PD);skin conductance","Skin;Diseases;Fluctuations;Databases;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Temperature measurement","","","","45","IEEE","6 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
