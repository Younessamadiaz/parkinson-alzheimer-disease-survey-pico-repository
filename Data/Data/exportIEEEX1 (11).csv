Sixty-five patients diagnosed with advanced PD were recruited in an open longitudinal 36-month study; 35 treated with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and 30 were candidates for switching from oral PD treatment to LCIG. They utilized a test battery, consisting of self-assessments of symptoms and fine motor tests (tapping and spiral drawings), four times per day in their homes during week-long test periods. The repeated measurements were summarized into an overall test score (OTS) to represent the global condition of the patient during a test period. Clinical assessments included ratings on unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) and 39-item PD questionnaire (PDQ-39) scales. In LCIG-naïve patients, the mean OTS compared to baseline was significantly improved from the first test period on LCIG treatment until month 24. In LCIG-nonnaïve patients, there were no significant changes in the mean OTS until month 36. The OTS correlated adequately with total UPDRS (rho = 0.59) and total PDQ-39 (0.59). Responsiveness measured as effect size was 0.696 and 0.536 for OTS and UPDRS, respectively. The trends of the test scores were similar to the trends of clinical rating scores but the dropout rate was high. Correlations between OTS and clinical rating scales were adequate indicating that the test battery contains important elements of the information of well-established scales. The responsiveness and reproducibility were better for OTS than for total UPDRS.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2468088","Swedish Knowledge Foundation; Abbot Product Operations AG, Allschwil, Switzerland; Nordforce Technology AB, Stockholm, Sweden; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194750","Home assessment;Levodopa infusion;Parkinson’s disease;Remote monitoring;Telemedicine;Home assessment;levodopa infusion;Parkinson's disease (PD);remote monitoring;telemedicine","Parkinson's disease;Remote monitoring;Fluctuations;Telemedicine;Biomedical measurement","Aged;Disease Progression;Female;Humans;Internet;Levodopa;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine;Telemetry;User-Computer Interface","13","","28","OAPA","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Pull Test is the most common clinical examination to assess postural instability in PD. However, the subjectivity and low discriminative power of this test presents as a major drawback. In this paper we propose a novel methodology to estimate the Pull Test scores from patients with PD. We capture the relationship between the Pull Test outcomes and patients' foot motion patterns, using wearable sensors mounted on their shoes. 139 idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients performed four motor function tests, including walking and repetitive foot motions, while acceleration and orientation data was recorded. A total of 684 features were extracted from the acceleration and orientation signals. Feature selection and classification algorithms were utilized to estimate the Pull Test score for each participant. Further, we estimate which motor function test would better predict the Pull Test score, depending on the patient's phenotype (i.e. bradykinetic, tremor-dominant or equivalent). When combining all phenotypes and all tests, the mean of the classification probability distribution achieved was 0.75 (CI: [0.69 – 0.82]). Foot circling was the best predictive test for the equivalent patients (mean = 0.79, CI: [0.69 – 0.87]) and the bradykinetic patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64 – 0.85]), while 2×10 m. walk with stop-and-go proved superior for the tremor-dominant patients (mean: 0.75, CI: [0.64 – 0.85]). Overall, these results suggest that inertial data from patient's foot motion can be used to estimate postural instability in PD patients.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7319050","","Parkinson's disease;Feature extraction;Foot;Chlorine;Frequency measurement;Accuracy;Acceleration","Algorithms;Databases as Topic;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Physiology;Probability","15","","18","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CNN provides feature extraction capability, while RF provides classification capacity, and the model combines these two characteristics, leading to high diagnostic performance. The proposed approach is then evaluated on an available real dataset, which includes MRI images and other clinical features like motor UPDRS scores, cognitive test results, age, and gender, and the experimental outcomes are reported. Based on the authors' experimental findings, the hybrid CNN-RF model produced the highest accuracy of 93 %. 7% outperforming CNN and RF standalone models with accuracies of 88. 4% and 85. The model also erected a high sensitivity of 94. 2 % and a specificity of 92. 8% provided a reliable model for differentiating PD cases and the control group. The first metric is ROC with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of0. 96, hence adding to the confirmation of the workability of the model when discriminating between the classes. The assessments of motor UPDRS scores suggested that they were essential predictors of PD and that specific brain regions revealed by the CNN were also important indicators of PD.

A novel algorithm system has been derived to detect all the motor examinations of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), of which the accuracy has been verified by high-speed camera system. This system includes three categories of detection parameters: the trajectory parameters, time-frequency parameters, angle parameters. Average accuracy for the detection with IMU can reach to 87%, 90% and 95%, respectively.With 17 patients’ trial tests, it’s observed that there do have certain differences of the movement parameters in between patients and age 20th youth controls. For 3.6 Pronation and Supination, the rotation speed of normal control can be twice of the patients and the deviation of the amplitude can reach to 45 degrees of patient in comparison to 5 degrees of normal control.

This is in contrast to earlier work in which we showed that this can be done using hand-calculated features of the speech (such as formants) as annotated by professional speech therapists. In this paper, we review that work and show that a differential diagnosis can be produced directly from the analog speech signal itself. In addition, differentiation can be made between seven different degrees of progression of the disease (including healthy). Such a system can act as an additional stage (or another building block) in a bigger system of natural speech processing. For example it could be used in automatic speech recognition systems that are used as personal assistants (such as Iphones' Siri, Google Voice), or as natural man-machine interfaces. We also conjecture that such systems can be extended to monitoring and classifying additional neurological diseases and speech pathologies.

In this paper, the gait of two healthy individuals and three patients with PD is compared using a radar network to determine which gait parameters are more determinant to detect PD. This effect is quantified for three different gait paces. The results show that the mean and maximum stride times when the subjects walk at their regular pace are the most determinant to detect PD.

A person with PD manifests PD-related symptoms. The condition slows down movement, affects speech, and the ability to perform a task, and writing becomes time-consuming for a person suffering from it. The prevalence of PD is 1-2 per 1000 people at any time. Parkinson's Disease cases rise with age and affect 1% of those over the age of 60. Even in this day and age, despite the numerous technological developments and advancements that have been made, the process of early disease detection is still challenging to achieve. As a result of this, it is important to develop automatic methods that are based on machine learning and that assist clinicians in accurately identifying this disease in its early phases. Literature supports the link between Parkinson's disease and the cardiovascular system. In research, the main objective is to establish the correlation between PD and heart disease by using a Machine learning algorithm named Extreme Gradient Boosting. The experiments were run utilizing python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit Learn.

Manual speech signal analysis, however, can be laborious and error prone. Thus, methods based on Deep Learning (DL) have been suggested to streamline the procedure and increase precision. YAMNet, a deep-learning model for audio categorization which is computationally efficient, was used to extract features from the PD dataset. The effectiveness and accuracy of the predictions were evaluated. Using the analysis of speech signals, the study sought to create a precise and effective tool for the early identification and management of PD.

The data were compared with the motor scores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Assessment Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn-Yahr Staging Scale. The results showed that the motor UPDRS scores and the Hoehn-Yahr Staging scale were consistent. Furthermore, it was seen that the rigidity enhancing effect of the Froment maneuver can be distinguished by the established system. It was noted that the stiffness scores with Froment maneuver measurements made for the same patient were 1 point higher than the stiffness scores without Froment maneuver measurements. Also; As a result of the comparison made with the stiffness scoring performed by the physician, it was found that the stiffness data obtained were generally consistent with the physician scoring. However, according to the data obtained, some physician scoring deviations from normal were determined. As a result of these studies, a lower-upper limit was established for stiffness values evaluated between 0-4 points.
