Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline and brain pathology involving amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Current drug development focuses on disease-modifying therapies, primarily antibodies targeting amyloid or tau. However, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a challenge for drug delivery to the brain. Pre-and early clinical data suggests that Focused Ultrasound (FUS) technology safely enhances BBB permeability without damaging brain tissue, enabling drug delivery. This systematic review discusses the application of FUS to open the BBB for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We review the safety, efficacy, and potential biological effects of FUS-mediated BBB opening in AD patients.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease associated with behavioral abnormalities, memory loss, and cognitive impairment that cause major causes of dementia in the elderly. The pathogenetic processes cause complex effects on brain function and AD progression. The proper protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is critical for cell health. AD causes the buildup of misfolded proteins, particularly tau and amyloid-beta, to break down proteostasis, such aggregates are toxic to neurons and play a critical role in AD pathogenesis. The rise of cellular senescence is accompanied by aging, marked by irreversible cell cycle arrest and the release of pro-inflammatory proteins. Senescent cell build-up in the brains of AD patients exacerbates neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration. These cells senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) also disturbs the brain environment. When proteostasis failure and cellular senescence coalesce, a cycle is generated that compounds each other. While senescent cells contribute to proteostasis breakdown through inflammatory and degradative processes, misfolded proteins induce cellular stress and senescence. The principal aspects of the neurodegenerative processes in AD are the interaction of cellular senescence and proteostasis failure. This review explores the interconnected roles of proteostasis disruption and cellular senescence in the pathways leading to neurodegeneration in AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction, which eventually leads to the disability and mortality of older adults. Although the precise mechanisms by which age promotes the development of AD remains poorly understood, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in the development of AD. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this debilitating disease. It is well accepted that exercise exerts neuroprotective effects by ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction in the neurons of AD, which involves multiple mechanisms, including mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis, mitophagy, transport, and signal transduction. In addition, exercise promotes mitochondria communication with other organelles in AD neurons, which should receive more attentions in the future.

Abstract: In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), timely identification is paramount for effective management, acknowledging its chronic and irreversible nature, where medications can only impede its progression. Our study introduces a holistic solution, leveraging the hippocampus and the VGG16 model with transfer learning for early AD detection. The hippocampus, a pivotal early affected region linked to memory, plays a central role in classifying patients into three categories: cognitively normal (CN), representing individuals without cognitive impairment; mild cognitive impairment (MCI), indicative of a subtle decline in cognitive abilities; and AD, denoting Alzheimer's disease. Employing the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, our model undergoes training enriched by advanced image preprocessing techniques, achieving outstanding accuracy (testing 98.17 %, validation 97.52 %, training 99.62 %). The strategic use of transfer learning fortifies our competitive edge, incorporating the hippocampus approach and, notably, a progressive data augmentation technique. This innovative augmentation strategy gradually introduces augmentation factors during training, significantly elevating accuracy and enhancing the model's generalization ability. The study emphasizes practical application with a user-friendly website, empowering radiologists to predict class probabilities, track disease progression, and visualize patient images in both 2D and 3D formats, contributing significantly to the advancement of early AD detection.

Abstract: Background
Neurodegenerative diseases require collaborative, multisite research to comprehensively grasp their complex and diverse pathological progression; however, there is caution in aggregating global data due to data heterogeneity. In the current study, we investigated brain structure across stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and how relationships vary across sources of heterogeneity.
Methods
Using 6 international datasets (N > 27,000), associations of structural neuroimaging markers were investigated in relation to the AD continuum via meta-analysis. We investigated whether associations varied across elements of magnetic resonance imaging acquisition, study design, and populations.
Results
Modest differences in associations were found depending on how data were acquired; however, patterns were similar. Preliminary results suggested that neuroimaging marker–AD relationships differ across ethnic groups.
Conclusions
Diversity in data offers unique insights into the neural substrate of AD; however, harmonized processing and transparency of data collection are needed. Global collaborations should embrace the inherent heterogeneity that exists in the data and quantify its contribution to research findings at the meta-analytical stage.

Abstract: Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main type of dementia, involves in complex pathophysiological processes, including abnormal lysosomes function. Cathepsins are the predominant proteases responsible for the degradation of diverse substrates in the endo-lysosomal system. However, there was still a lack of systematic study on the causal association between cathepsins and AD.
Methods
This study utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the association between blood cathepsins and the risk of AD, as well as the level of amyloid-β (Aβ) and p-Tau in cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, an independent dataset was employed to corroborate the above result. Importantly, this study incorporated the Alzheimer's disease Immunization and Microbiota Initiative study Cohort to further validate the alteration of blood cathepsins expression level and examine its correlation with cognitive level and plasma AD-related pathological markers.
Results
Using MR method, we observed that high level of cathepsin L (CTSL) was associated with a lower risk of AD in both training and validation data. In observational cohort, we found there was decreased blood CTSL expression level in Aβ+ cognitive impaired (CI) group, compared with Aβ− cognitive unimpaired (CU) group. Correlation analysis revealed that blood CTSL expression level was negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, plasma Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 level in Aβ+ CI group. Mediation analysis showed that plasma Aβ42/40 level was the key mediator in the association between blood CTSL and MMSE score in Aβ+ CI participants.
Conclusion
This study revealed that blood CTSL was an important factor affecting the risk of AD, and it affected the cognitive level of AD patients through plasma Aβ42/40 level.

Abstract: Microneedle (MN) patches are gaining increasing attention as a cost-effective technology for delivering drugs directly into the skin. In the present study, two different 3D printing processes were utilized to produce coated MNs, namely, digital light processing (DLP) and semisolid extrusion (SSE). Donepezil (DN), a cholinesterase inhibitor administered for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, was incorporated into the coating material. Physiochemical characterization of the coated MNs confirmed the successful incorporation of donepezil as well as the stability and suitability of the materials for transdermal delivery. Optical microscopy and SEM studies validated the uniform weight distribution and precise dimensions of the MN arrays, while mechanical testing ensured the MNs’ robustness, ensuring efficient skin penetration. In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the produced transdermal patches, indicating their potential use in clinical treatment. Permeation studies revealed a significant increase in DN permeation compared to plain coating material, affirming the effectiveness of the MNs in enhancing transdermal drug delivery. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) elucidated the distribution of the API, within skin layers, demonstrating sustained drug release and transcellular transport pathways. Finally, cell studies were also conducted on NIH3T3 fibroblasts to evaluate the biocompatibility and safety of the printed objects for transdermal applications.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are challenging to cure. To date, no cure has been found for Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease, and current treatments are able only to slow the progression of the diseases and manage their symptoms. After an introduction to the complex biology of these diseases, we discuss the beneficial effect of selenium-containing agents, which show neuroprotective effects in vitro or in vivo. Indeed, selenium is an essential trace element that is being incorporated into innovative organoselenium compounds, which can improve outcomes in rodent or even primate models with neurological deficits. Herein, we critically discuss recent findings in the field of selenium-based applications in neurological disorders.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is among the most common neurodegenerative disorders. AD is characterized by deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques, leading to associated secondary pathologies, progressive neurodegeneration, and eventually death. Currently used diagnostics are largely image-based, lack accuracy and do not detect early disease, ie, prior to onset of symptoms, thus limiting treatment options and outcomes. Although biomarkers such as amyloid-β and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid have gained much attention, these are generally limited to disease progression. Unfortunately, identification of biomarkers for early and accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. As such, body fluids such as sweat, serum, saliva, mucosa, tears, and urine are under investigation as alternative sources for biomarkers that can aid in early disease detection. This review focuses on biomarkers identified through proteomics in various biofluids and their potential for early and accurate diagnosis of AD.

Abstract: Summary
In this high-throughput proteomic study of autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD), we sought to identify early biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for disease monitoring and treatment strategies. We examined CSF proteins in 286 mutation carriers (MCs) and 177 non-carriers (NCs). The developed multi-layer regression model distinguished proteins with different pseudo-trajectories between these groups. We validated our findings with independent ADAD as well as sporadic AD datasets and employed machine learning to develop and validate predictive models. Our study identified 137 proteins with distinct trajectories between MCs and NCs, including eight that changed before traditional AD biomarkers. These proteins are grouped into three stages: early stage (stress response, glutamate metabolism, neuron mitochondrial damage), middle stage (neuronal death, apoptosis), and late presymptomatic stage (microglial changes, cell communication). The predictive model revealed a six-protein subset that more effectively differentiated MCs from NCs, compared with conventional biomarkers.

Abstract: Summary
Advances in treatment are changing not only the therapeutic options for patients with Alzheimer's disease; they're also changing their diagnostic options. Technologies to detect amyloid such as PET imaging and blood or CSF testing now have a central role in Alzheimer's disease care. Notably, this role has been made possible by regulatory approval and coverage by payers of therapies. Access to treatments and the diagnostic tests needed to prescribe them is encourageing but it reveals a problem. These tests are tailored to the needs of the therapies, not to the needs of patients. Patients and families need to understand the causes of their impairments and their prognosis. This requires access to the best available diagnostic tests and this access should not depend on the availability of treatments. These tests should be used to their fullest capacity to inform patients of the causes of their cognitive impairments and their prognosis. Unfortunately, compared to diagnostic testing, treatment options are overvalued. We call this problem the tyranny of treatment.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative condition, is characterized by the slow and progressive deterioration of the cognitive functions of geriatric patients. It occurs due to exacerbation of neurons in the brain, indicated by loss of memory, mood instability, and even death. The aggregation of amyloid β protein and neurofibrillary tangles-atypical forms of tau protein is the major cause of this disease. Phytoconstituents have been frequently employed in treating Alzheimer's disease. These natural compounds act through different molecular mechanisms to treat the disease. However, their potential in Alzheimer's disease therapy may be limited due to poor blood-brain barrier permeability, off-target effects, low bioavailability, etc. In recent times, nanotechnology has gained attraction to overcome these challenges. This article focuses on the potential phytoconstituents for Alzheimer's disease treatment and the associated limitations. Moreover, it highlights various nanoformulation strategies employed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively, avoid side effects, improve bioavailability, and target specificity in treating Alzheimer's disease. The integration of nanotechnology with plant-derived compounds has the potential to revolutionize the therapeutic landscape for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Purpose
Numerous studies have highlighted a close link between metabolic imbalances and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The advancement of metabolomics has recently enabled the exploration of characteristic metabolic changes associated with AD. Studies indicate that serum glutamate (Glu) levels may correlate with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. This study aims to further elucidate the characteristics of baseline serum Glu levels in MCI and AD.
Methods
This study included 783 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) cohort, categorized into cognitively normal (CN, n = 224), stable MCI (sMCI, n = 181), progressive MCI (pMCI, n = 193), and AD (n = 185). The study aimed to analyze the diagnostic value of baseline serum Glu, to explore its predictive capability for the progression from CN to MCI or AD, and from MCI to AD, and to analyze the relationship between serum Glu and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and cognitive functions in different diagnostic groups.
Results
Compared to the CN and sMCI groups, the pMCI group showed significantly lower levels of serum Glu, and the AD group also had lower Glu levels compared to the sMCI group. However, serum Glu did not show significant diagnostic value for MCI and AD. Lower levels of serum Glu could predict the progression from MCI to AD.
Conclusion
Serum Glu levels can predict the progression from MCI to AD, suggesting that it could provide new insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. However, serum Glu may not be an ideal peripheral biomarker for AD.

Abstract: This study investigates the association between cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal volumes in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) using Mendelian randomization. A meta-analysis of 503 healthy controls, 562 MCI patients, and 389 CE patients revealed significant reductions in hippocampal and subregion volumes in MCI and AD compared to controls. While various subregions showed volume reductions, no causal relationship between hippocampal volume and AD was established through Mendelian randomization analysis. In conclusion, significant volume reductions were observed in MCI and AD patients, highlighting the complexity of the relationship between hippocampal volume and cognitive impairment.

Abstract: Summary
Blood biomarkers have emerged as accessible, cost-effective, and highly promising tools for advancing the diagnostics of Alzheimer’s disease. However, transitioning from cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to blood biomarkers—eg, to verify amyloid β pathology—requires careful consideration. This Series paper highlights the main challenges in the implementation of blood biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease in different possible contexts of use. Despite the robustness of measuring blood biomarker concentrations, the widespread adoption of blood biomarkers requires rigorous standardisation efforts to address inherent challenges in diverse contexts of use. The challenges include understanding the effect of pre-analytical and analytical conditions, potential confounding factors, and comorbidities that could influence outcomes of blood biomarkers and their use in diverse populations. Additionally, distinct scenarios present their own specific challenges. In memory clinics, the successful integration of blood biomarkers in diagnostic tests will require well-established diagnostic accuracy and comprehensive assessments of the effect of blood biomarkers on the diagnostic confidence and patient management of clinicians. In primary care settings, and even more when implemented in population-based screening programmes for which no experience with any biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease currently exists, the implementation of blood biomarkers will be challenged by the need for education of primary care clinical staff and clear guidelines. However, despite the challenges, blood biomarkers hold great promise for substantially enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and effectively streamlining referral processes, leading to earlier diagnosis and access to treatments. The ongoing efforts that are shaping the integration of blood biomarkers across diverse clinical settings pave the way towards precision medicine in Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: The growing prevalence and burden of Alzheimer's disease has catalysed huge investments in research on its causes, diagnosis, treatment and care. After many high-profile failures, recent clinical trials of anti-amyloid drugs have marked a turning point for the field, leading to the approval of the first disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease by the FDA. It is now up to European regulators to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to approve these drugs for patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Here, we outline Alzheimer Europe's position on anti-amyloid therapies for Alzheimer's disease, which was adopted by the Board of Alzheimer Europe following consultations with our member associations and with the European Working Group of People with Dementia. Beyond questions of drug efficacy, safety and cost, we highlight important issues that must be addressed by industry, regulators, payers, healthcare systems and governments, to ensure that patients have timely, appropriate and equitable access to innovative treatments, regardless of their socio-economic background, insurance status, or place of residence. We also call for continued investment in research on treatments that might benefit people with more advanced Alzheimer's disease–as well as support and care services that can help people live well with dementia at all stages of the disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder proven to be caused by the aggregation of protein tau into fibrils, resulting in neuronal death. The irreparable neuronal damage leads to irreversible symptoms with no cure; therefore, disaggregation of these tau fibrils could be targeted as a therapeutic approach to AD. Here we have developed a fungal natural product library to screen for secondary metabolites that have bioactive potential towards AD tau. Our initial screenings indicate that penicillic acid demonstrates anti-aggregation activity towards tau, while further in vitro experiments reveal that penicillic acid directly inhibits tau by disaggregating fibrils. Although penicillic acid possesses blood–brain barrier penetrability properties that are computationally predicted to be favorable, it is presumed to contain some mutagenic effects as well. To address this, we used the backbone of penicillic acid as a chemical probe to discover similar compounds that can inhibit AD tau aggregation with limited mutagenicity. This work suggests the potential of discovering chemical probes through natural product screening for small-molecule drug discovery of tauopathies.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive neurological disease that has affected at least 50 million people around the globe. Considering the severity of the disease and the continuous increase in the number of patients, the development of new effective drugs or intervention strategies for AD has become urgent. AD is caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, but its exact cause has not yet been clarified. Given the current challenges being faced in the clinical treatment of AD, such as complex AD pathological network and insufficient early diagnosis, herein, we have focused on the three core pathological features of AD, including amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, tau phosphorylation and tangles, and activation of inflammatory factors. In this review, we have briefly underscored the primary evidence supporting each pathology and discuss AD pathological network among Aβ, tau, and inflammation. We have also comprehensively summarized the most instructive drugs and their treatment strategies against Aβ, tau, or neuroinflammation used in basic research and clinical trials. Finally, we have discussed and outlined the pros and cons of each pathological approach and looked forward to potential personalized diagnosis and treatment strategies that are beneficial to AD patients.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge due to its prevalence and lack of cure, driving the quest for effective treatments. Anshen Bunao Syrup, a traditional Chinese medicine known for its neuroprotective properties, shows promise in addressing this need. However, understanding its precise mechanisms in AD remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate Anshen Bunao Syrup's therapeutic potential in AD treatment using a scopolamine-induced AD rat model. Assessments included novel-object recognition and Morris water maze tasks to evaluate spatial learning and memory, alongside Nissl staining and ELISA analyses for neuronal damage and biomarker levels. Results demonstrated that Anshen Bunao Syrup effectively mitigated cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting amyloid-β and phosphorylation Tau aggregation, thereby reducing neuronal damage. Metabolomics profiling of rats cortex revealed alterations in key metabolites implicated in tryptophan and fatty acid metabolism pathways, suggesting a role in the therapeutic effects of Anshen Bunao Syrup. Additionally, ELISA and correlation analyses indicated attenuation of oxidative stress and immune response through metabolic remodeling. In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence for the neuroprotective effects of Anshen Bunao Syrup in AD models, shedding light on its potential as a therapeutic agent for AD prevention and treatment.

Abstract: Phosphorylated Tau proteins are promising biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease. This study presents a novel voltametric sensor using a vanadium MXene polydopamine (VxPDA) redox active composite and a Tau-441-specific polyaniline molecularly imprinted polymer (PANI MIP) for the sensitive detection of Tau-441 in interstitial fluid (ISF) and plasma. The VxPDA/PANI MIP sensor demonstrates a broad detection range of 5 fg/mL to 5 ng/mL (122 aM/L to 122 pM/L) in ISF without the use of redox mediators, with a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 2.3 fg/mL (60 aM/L). Furthermore, a handheld device utilizing this technology successfully detects Tau-441 in artificial serum with high sensitivity (5 fg/mL to 150 fg/mL (122 aM/L to 366 aM/L)) and specificity within a clinically relevant range. The rapid detection time (∼32 min) and low cost (∼£20/device) of this sensor highlight its potential for minimally invasive, early AD diagnosis in clinical settings. This advancement aims to facilitate a transition away from invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based diagnostic techniques for AD.

Abstract: Substantial sleep impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the emerging points for continued efforts to better understand the disease. Individuals without cognitive decline, an important marker of the clinical phase of AD, may show early alterations in the sleep-wake cycle. The objective of this critical narrative review is to explore the bidirectional pathophysiological correlation between sleep disturbances and Alzheimer’s Disease. Specifically, it examines how the disruption of sleep homeostasis in individuals without dementia could contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, and conversely, how neurodegeneration in individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease might lead to dysregulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Recent scientific results indicate that sleep disturbances, particularly those related to impaired glymphatic clearance, may act as an important mechanism associated with the genesis of Alzheimer’s Disease. Additionally, amyloid deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation, along with astrocytic hyperactivation, appear to trigger changes in neurotransmission dynamics in areas related to sleep, which may explain the onset of sleep disturbances in individuals with AD. Disruption of sleep homeostasis appears to be a modifiable risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease. Whenever possible, the use of non-pharmacological strategies becomes important in this context. From a different perspective, additional research is needed to understand and treat the dysfunction of the sleep-wake cycle in individuals already affected by AD. Early recognition and correction of sleep disturbances in this population could potentially mitigate the progression of dementia and improve the quality of life for those with AD.

Abstract: Lithium has been approved and used for several decades in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, and its potential effect in neurodegenerative diseases has been subject to increasing research interest in recent years. Nanolithium is a new experimental product using a novel drug-delivery technology (Aonys®), which optimizes its bioavailability while reducing its toxicity profile. Therapeutic doses of lithium used in Nanolithium are more than 50 times lower than the minimal dose of classical lithium salts. In this review we report data from non-clinical pharmacology studies supporting Nanolithium efficacy and the mechanism of action in Alzheimer's disease. GSK-3β inhibition is thought to be central to Nanolithium's mechanism of action, triggering a reduction of the production of toxic amyloid plaques and decrease in tau hyperphosphorylation, which could potentially benefit both neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. We then summarize outcomes from non-clinical proof-of-concept studies. These data supported the initiation of a currently ongoing phase II proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Nanolithium in patients with mild-to-severe Alzheimer's disease. We highlight key aspects of the study design. We finish this review with a discussion on the potential place of Nanolithium in the current and future Alzheimer's disease treatment landscape.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing and analysis techniques aimed at enhancing early diagnosis methods for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Leveraging a dataset that has EEG data of individuals diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), AD, Healthy Controls, and the study explores Preprocessing Methods and Feature Extraction Techniques, with machine learning model notably Support Vector Machines (SVM). In the preprocessing phase, a combination of high pass, lowpass, Savitzky–Golay, and median filters are applied, informed by a comprehensive review of filter comparison literature. Feature extraction encompasses three primary categories: ‘Statistical, ‘Frequency Domain’ and ‘Time Domain’. The scope of this work is to explore features in all these three domains and build SVM based model for efficient classification. In our investigation, we achieved a categorization accuracy of 92 % through the utilization of statistical features. Employing time domain features resulted in an accuracy of 87 %, while frequency domain features also yielded an 87 % accuracy rate in our study. The primary objective of this study is that it aims to enhance early AD diagnosis through advanced EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques, focusing on preprocessing methods, feature extraction, and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Alzheimer's is one of the brain syndromes that steadily affects the brain memory. The early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the growth of Alzheimer's is not certain in patients with MCI. The premature detection of Alzheimer's is crucial for maintaining healthy brain function and avoiding memory loss. Different multi-neural network architectures have been proposed by researchers for efficient and accurate AD detection. The absence of improved feature extraction mechanisms and unexplored efficient optimizers in complex benchmark architectures lead to an inefficient and inaccurate AD classification. Moreover, the standard convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architectures for Alzheimer's diagnosis lack interpretability in their predictions. An interpretable, simplified, yet effective deep learning model is required for the accurate classification of AD. In this study, a generalized fractional order-based CNN classifier with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) capabilities is proposed for accurate, efficient, and interpretable classification of AD diagnosis. The proposed study (a) classifies AD accurately by incorporating unexplored pooling technique with enhanced feature extraction mechanism, (b) provides fractional order-based optimization approach for adaptive learning and fast convergence speed, and (c) suggests an interpretable method for proving the transparency of the model. The proposed model outperforms complex benchmark architectures with regard to accuracy using standard ADNI dataset. The proposed fractional order-based CNN classifier achieves an improved accuracy of 99 % as compared to the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease(AD) poses a significant challenge due to its widespread prevalence and the lack of effective treatments, highlighting the urgent need for early detection. This research introduces an enhanced neural network, named ADnet, which is based on the VGG16 model, to detect Alzheimer's disease using two-dimensional MRI slices. ADNet incorporates several key improvements: it replaces traditional convolution with depthwise separable convolution to reduce model parameters, replaces the ReLU activation function with ELU to address potential issues with exploding gradients, and integrates the SE(Squeeze-and-Excitation) module to enhance feature extraction efficiency. In addition to the primary task of MRI feature extraction, ADnet is simultaneously trained on two auxiliary tasks: clinical dementia score regression and mental state score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the baseline VGG16, ADNet achieves a 4.18% accuracy improvement for AD vs. CN classification and a 6% improvement for MCI vs. CN classification. These findings highlight the effectiveness of ADnet in classifying Alzheimer's disease, providing crucial support for early diagnosis and intervention by medical professionals. The proposed enhancements represent advancements in neural network architecture and training strategies for improved AD classification.

Abstract: Summary
People with intellectual disability are a vulnerable cohort who face challenges accessing health care. Compared with the general population, people with intellectual disability have an elevated risk of developing dementia, which often presents at a younger age and with atypical symptoms. The lifelong cognitive and functional difficulties faced by people with intellectual disability further complicate the diagnostic process. Specialised intellectual disability memory services and evaluation using reliable biomarkers of neurodegeneration are needed to improve diagnostic and prognostic certainty in this group. Inadequate specialist services and paucity of research on biomarkers in this population hinders progress and impedes the delivery of adequate health care. Although cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers and radiological biomarkers are used routinely in the evaluation of Alzheimer’s disease in the general population, biological variation within the clinically heterogenous group of people with intellectual disability could affect the clinical utility of existing biomarkers. As disease-modifying therapies become available for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease, and hopefully other neurodegenerative conditions in the future, biomarkers will serve as gatekeepers to establish the eligibility for such therapies. Inadequate representation of adults with intellectual disability in biomarker research will result in their exclusion from treatment with disease-modifying therapies, thus perpetuating the inequity in health care that is already faced by this group. The aim of this Series paper is to summarise current evidence on the application of biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease in a population with intellectual disability (that is not attributable to Down syndrome) and suspected cognitive decline.

Abstract: Geometric surface models are extensively utilized in brain imaging to analyze and compare three-dimensional anatomical shapes. Due to the intricate nature of the brain surface, rather than examining the entire cortical surface, we are introducing a new set of signatures focused on characteristics of the hippocampal region, which is linked to aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Our approach focuses on Ricci flow as a conformal parameterization method, permitting us to calculate the conformal factor and mean curvature as conformal surface representations to identify distinct regions within a three-dimensional mesh. For the first time for such settings, we propose a simple while elegant formulation by employing the well-established concept of Shannon entropy on these well-known features. This compact while rich feature formulation turns out to lead to an efficient local surface encoding. We are validating its effectiveness through a series of preliminary experiments on 3D MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), with the aim of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. The feature vectors generated and inputted into the XGBoost classifier demonstrate a remarkable level of accuracy, further emphasizing their potential as a valuable additional measure for surface-based cortical morphometry in Alzheimer's disease research.

Abstract: Alzheimer's is a progressive and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily functioning. It is an irreversible brain disease that destroys memory, thinking, and the ability to carry out daily activities. It poses significant challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Modern societies are trying to enhance the quality of people's lives, including Alzheimer's patients. In this study, we explored the potential of social robots to provide emotional support, improve cognitive function, and facilitate communication among Alzheimer's patients. This was achieved by initiating conversations on various topics such as family, relationships, and daily activities. This paper contributes to the literature by introducing a novel and well-organized framework for building an Alzheimer's care robot. Further, this study enriches the literature by introducing the Alzheimer Care Companion Robot (ACCR), designed to identify Alzheimer's patients. The ACCR initiates conversations in the native Arab-Kuwaiti dialect, displaying relevant memories through images and videos on its screen to assist in memory recall based on the individuals' life experiences. The proposed ACCR consists of 271 conversations belonging to three main categories: active, proactive, and graphical user interface (GUI) dialogs comprising 112 dialogs, 109 dialogs, and 50 dialogs for active, proactive, and GUI, respectively. The experimental result illustrated the success of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Tau protein aggregation is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles that disrupt neural communication and ultimately result in cognitive decline. Nanotechnology presents novel strategies for both diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease. Nanotechnology. It has become a revolutionary tool in the fight against Alzheimer's disease, particularly in addressing the pathological accumulation of tau protein. This review explores the relationship between tau-related neurophysiology and the utilization of nanotechnology for AD treatment, focusing on the application of nanomaterials to regulate tau phosphorylation, hinder tau aggregation and propagation, stabilize microtubules, eliminate pathological tau and emphasize the potential of nanotechnology in developing personalized therapies and monitoring treatment responses in AD patients. This review combines tau-related neurophysiology with nanotechnology to provide new insights for further understanding and treating Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: “Brain organoids”, “cerebral organoids” or “mini-brains” are the terms that have been frequently used to describe self-organizing 3D structures which could be derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), adult stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The fact that certain cell types could be reprogrammed to study some aspects of brain development and certain disease conditions has advanced our understanding of brain development in health and disease. Human brain development is somewhat intriguing, however, complex, sharing close similarities with both primate and rodent brain development, despite species heterogeneity. The in-vivo and in-vitro models have been used over time to study the development of the brain in health and disease states. The in-vitro system being a monolayer system is unable to recapitulate some essential aspects of human brain development and even certain disease conditions like microcephaly, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) to mention a few, because of the complex pathophysiology of these diseases. Based on this premise, recent studies are now beginning to examine the role of patient-derived human tissues reprogrammed into stem cells with the ability to organize into 3D cerebral organoids in studying and understanding the complex nature of neurodegenerative diseases which have been difficult to model in-vitro and in-vivo. Here, we highlight evidence of patient-derived brain organoids in modeling Alzheimer’s disease, providing evidence on the current challenges and prospects in growing cerebral organoids and some approaches that have been developed to overcome these challenges.

Abstract: Background
As disease-modifying Alzheimer's (AD) treatments are becoming available, concerns have been raised that even high-income countries lack the diagnostic capacity to accurately identify eligible patients in a timely manner.
Objectives
We analyze how much NHS England would have to invest in capacity for AD specialists, biomarker testing with PET scans or CSF testing and MRI scans to reach G7 average levels and estimate the effect on wait times in the diagnostic process.
Design
Desk research and expert interviews for cost and capacity data. Markov model to estimate wait times.
Setting
NHS England.
Measurements
AD specialists, and PET and MRI scanners per capita in G7 countries and wait times in England under different investment scenarios.
Results
England has the lowest number of PET and MRI scanners and the second-lowest of AD specialists per capita among the G7 countries. An investment of GBP 14 billion over ten years would be needed to reach G7 average levels, of which 31%, 22%, 10%, 37% would be devoted to capacity for memory assessment services, PET scanning, CSF analysis, and MRI scanning, respectively. This investment would reduce estimated average wait times by around 87% between 2023 and 2032.
Conclusions
The NHS England has large gaps in diagnostic capacity for AD. Without substantial investments, AD patients in England would experience substantial wait times and avoidable disease progression.

Abstract: Background
Easily accessible and self-administered cognitive assessments that can aid early detection for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia risk are critical for timely intervention.
Objectives/Design
This cross-sectional study investigated continuous associations between Mayo Test Drive (MTD)–a remote, self-administered, multi-device compatible, web-based cognitive assessment–and AD-related imaging biomarkers.
Participants/Setting
684 adults from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participated (age=70.4±11.2, 49.7% female). Participants were predominantly cognitively unimpaired (CU; 94.0%).
Measurements
Participants completed (1) brain amyloid and tau PET scans and MRI scans for hippocampal volume (HV) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH); (2) MTD remotely, consisting of the Stricker Learning Span and Symbols Test which combine into an MTD composite; and (3) in-person neuropsychological assessment including measures to obtain Mayo Preclinical Alzheimer's disease Cognitive Composite (Mayo-PACC) and Global-z. Multiple regressions adjusted for age, sex, and education queried associations between imaging biomarkers and scores from remote and in-person cognitive measures.
Results
Lower performances on MTD were associated with greater amyloid, entorhinal tau, and global tau PET burden, lower HV, and higher WMH. Mayo-PACC and Global-z were associated with all imaging biomarkers except global tau PET burden. MCI/Dementia participants showed lower performance on all MTD measures compared to CU with large effect sizes (Hedge's g's=1.65–2.02), with similar findings for CU versus MCI only (Hedge's g's=1.46–1.83).
Conclusion
MTD is associated with continuous measures of AD-related imaging biomarkers, demonstrating ability to detect subtle cognitive change using a brief, remote assessment in predominantly CU individuals and criterion validity for MTD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, gradually impairing memory, intellectual, learning, and organizational capacities. An individual's capacity to perform fundamental daily tasks is greatly impacted. This review examines the advancements in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) using artificial intelligence (AI) methods and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The review introduces the importance of diagnosing AD accurately and the potential benefits of using AI techniques and machine learning algorithms for this purpose. The review is based on various state-of-the-art data sources including MRI data, PET imaging, EEG and MEG signals, and data from various sensors. The state-of-the-art radiomics approaches are explored to extract a wide range of information from medical images using data-characterization algorithms. These features can show temporal patterns and qualities that are not visible to the human eye. A novel data source (handwriting data) is thoroughly investigated and coupled with AI algorithms for the precise and early detection of cognitive loss associated with Alzheimer's disease. The paper discusses research directions, prospects, and future advances, as well as the proposed notion of employing a Robopen with an MPU-9250 sensor connected via Arduino. Finally, the review concludes with a summary of its significant findings and their clinical implications.

Abstract: Backgrounds
People with elevated beta amyloid have different risk and progress speed to Alzheimer's disease.
Purpose
The research is to validate the risk classification of AD developed in the Shanghai mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cohort study using ADNI data.
Methods
The risk classification of AD in MCI was based on several optimal cut-off points of a novel parameter Cog_Vol.
Results
In total, 843 subjects with MCI were included, of whom 220 had elevated PET beta amyloid. 273 (32.3 %) and 70 (31.8 %) progressed to AD in all subjects and in those with elevated PET beta amyloid, respectively. The risk of AD in subjects whose Cog_Vol >340 was very low, while the risk for those with Cog_Vol less than 101 indicated a super high within 4 years of follow-up.
Discussion
Risk classification using Cog_Vol at an optimal value was able to detect subjects among those with PET-amyloid-elevated MCI were at greater risk of developing AD and were unlikely to develop AD within 4 years of follow-up.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a challenging neurodegenerative condition, with overwhelming implications for affected individuals and healthcare systems worldwide. Animal models have played a crucial role in studying AD pathogenesis and testing therapeutic interventions. Remarkably, studies on the genetic factors affecting AD risk, such as APOE and TREM2, have provided valuable insights into disease mechanisms. Early diagnosis has emerged as a crucial factor in effective AD management, as demonstrated by clinical studies emphasizing the benefits of initiating treatment at early stages. Novel diagnostic technologies, including RNA sequencing of microglia, offer promising avenues for early detection and monitoring of AD progression. Therapeutic strategies remain to evolve, with a focus on targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology. Advances in animal models, such as APP-KI mice, and the advancement of anti-Aβ drugs signify progress towards more effective treatments. Therapeutically, the focus has shifted towards intricate approaches targeting multiple pathological pathways simultaneously. Strategies aimed at reducing Aβ plaque accumulation, inhibiting tau hyperphosphorylation, and modulating neuroinflammation are actively being explored, both in preclinical models and clinical trials. While challenges continue in developing validated animal models and translating preclinical findings to clinical success, the continuing efforts in understanding AD at molecular, cellular, and clinical levels offer hope for improved management and eventual prevention of this devastating disease.

Abstract: Recent research has revolutionized our understanding of memory consolidation by emphasizing the critical role of astrocytes, microglia, and immune cells in through cytokine signaling. Cytokines, compact proteins, play pivotal roles in neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and normal aging. This review explores the cellular mechanisms contributing to cognitive decline in inflammaging and Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting the paradoxical effects of most studied cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) in brain function, which act as a double-edged sword in brain physiology, acting both as facilitators of healthy cognitive function and as a potential contributor to cognitive decline.

Abstract: Amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated neuronal tau proteins accumulate in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a chronic neurodegenerative illness. Chronic inflammation in the brain, which promotes disease progression, is another feature of the Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Approximately 60–70 % of dementia cases are caused by AD. The development of effective therapies for the treatment of AD is urgently needed given the severity of the condition and its rapidly rising prevalence. Cholinesterase inhibitors, beta-amyloid (A-beta), tau inhibitors, and many other medications are currently used as preventive medicine for AD. These medications can temporarily suppress dementia symptoms but cannot halt or reverse the disease’s progression. Many international pharmaceutical companies have tried numerous times to develop an amyloid clearing medication based on the amyloid hypothesis, but without success. Therefore, the amyloid theory may not be entirely plausible. This review mainly covers the recent and important reported pharmacophores as the starting point to discuss already known targets like tau, butyrylcholinesterase, amyloid beta, and acetylcholinesterase and covers the literature between years 2019–2024.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily functioning. The pathology of AD is marked by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain, along with neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. Genetic factors, such as mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes, as well as the APOE ε4 allele, contribute to increased risk of acquiring AD. Currently available treatments provide symptomatic relief but do not halt disease progression. Research efforts are focused on developing disease-modifying therapies that target the underlying pathological mechanisms of AD. Advances in identification and validation of reliable biomarkers for AD hold great promise for enhancing early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and assessing treatment response in clinical practice in effort to alleviate the burden of this devastating disease. In this paper, we analyze data from the CAS Content Collection to summarize the research progress in Alzheimer’s disease. We examine the publication landscape in effort to provide insights into current knowledge advances and developments. We also review the most discussed and emerging concepts and assess the strategies to combat the disease. We explore the genetic risk factors, pharmacological targets, and comorbid diseases. Finally, we inspect clinical applications of products against AD with their development pipelines and efforts for drug repurposing. The objective of this review is to provide a broad overview of the evolving landscape of current knowledge regarding AD, to outline challenges, and to evaluate growth opportunities to further efforts in combating the disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative condition marked by gradual cognitive deterioration and the loss of neurons. While conventional bulk RNA sequencing techniques have shed light on AD pathology, they frequently obscure the cellular diversity within brain tissues. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our capability to analyze the cellular composition of AD, allowing for the detection of unique cell populations, rare cell types, and gene expression alterations at an individual cell level. This review examines the use of scRNA-seq in AD research, focusing on its contributions to understanding cellular diversity, disease progression, and potential therapeutic targets. We discuss key technological innovations, data analysis techniques, and challenges associated with scRNA-seq in studying AD. Furthermore, we highlight recent studies that have utilized scRNA-seq to identify novel biomarkers, uncover disease-associated pathways, and elucidate the role of non-neuronal cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, in AD pathogenesis. By providing a comprehensive overview of advancements in scRNA-seq for unraveling cellular heterogeneity in AD, this review highlights the transformative impact of scRNA-seq on our comprehension of disease mechanisms and the creation of targeted treatments.

Abstract: Aim
This study aims to enhance the precision of Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection by integrating Spatial Attention Mechanism into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
Background
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal protein deposits in the brain, leading to nerve cell loss and posing a significant global health challenge. Early and accurate detection is crucial for disease management and treatment due to the lack of a cure and the disease's severe progression.
Objective
The objective of this research is to improve the accuracy of Alzheimer's disease classification using MRI data by implementing a Spatial Attention Mechanism in a CNN architecture.
Methods
The study utilized T1-weighted MRI data from the OASIS 1 and OASIS 2 datasets. The key innovation is the Spatial Attention layer incorporated within a CNN model, which computes the average of each channel in the input feature map. This layer guides subsequent layers to focus on critical brain regions, enhancing the model's accuracy in differentiating between Alzheimer's disease stages.
Results
The model achieved a validation accuracy of 99.69% with a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0000, demonstrating its reliability in distinguishing between different stages of Alzheimer's disease. The adaptability of the Spatial Attention layer allows the model to assign higher weights to crucial brain regions, improving its discriminative power.
Conclusion
The integration of the Spatial Attention Mechanism into the CNN architecture significantly contributes to the early detection of Alzheimer's disease, enabling timely interventions. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize Alzheimer's diagnosis by enhancing accuracy and offering a robust solution for classification.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most predominant neurodegenerative disease and a quintessential entity within the dementia umbrella, is a global public health crisis. While the lack of disease modifying therapies has been a weak point in AD treatment, the success of recently approved monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics (aducanumab and lecanemab) targeted at the removal of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain is still under debate. There are multiple safety concerns about these approved neurotherapeutics including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, and even death. Novel paradigms focused on aquaporin-4-mediated neuro-perivascular Aβ and Tau protein clearance pathway are garnering attention. In this paper, we argue that orchestrating the drug discovery focused on glymphatic clearance-facilitating drugs (“glymphotherapeutics”) might be a potentially novel and viable strategy to mitigate the progression and improve the clinical outcomes of AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a disorder that worsens over time causing loss of memory and decline of cognitive functions. Current methods for diagnosis consist of neuroimaging scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scans), positron emission tomography (PET scans), and identifying biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). New forms of advanced technology such as machine learning are rising to quickly diagnose AD. This work is a comprehensive review of the research that uses machine learning methods to classify AD cases early. It is a study to provide details for MRI scans and biomarkers used for the recognition of AD and evaluates the execution of both applications while using different classifiers. This paper will discuss and compare various machine learning methods that can be implemented for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. The applications of these algorithms (MRI and biomarkers) are also discussed ultimately proposing the best algorithm and application for classification.

Abstract: Digital health technologies offer valuable advantages to dementia researchers and clinicians as screening tools, diagnostic aids, and monitoring instruments. To support the use and advancement of these resources, a comprehensive overview of the current technological landscape is essential. A multi-stakeholder working group, convened by the Digital Medicine Society (DiMe), conducted a landscape review to identify digital health technologies for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia populations. We searched studies indexed in PubMed, Embase, and APA PsycInfo to identify manuscripts published between May 2003 to May 2023 reporting analytical validation, clinical validation, or usability/feasibility results for relevant digital health technologies. Additional technologies were identified through community outreach. We collated peer-reviewed manuscripts, poster presentations, or regulatory documents for 106 different technologies for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia assessment covering diverse populations such as Lewy Body, vascular dementias, frontotemporal dementias, and all severities of Alzheimer's disease. Wearable sensors represent 32% of included technologies, non-wearables 61%, and technologies with components of both account for the remaining 7%. Neurocognition is the most prevalent concept of interest, followed by physical activity and sleep. Clinical validation is reported in 69% of evidence, analytical validation in 34%, and usability/feasibility in 20% (not mutually exclusive). These findings provide clinicians and researchers a landscape overview describing the range of technologies for assessing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. A living library of technologies is presented for the clinical and research communities which will keep findings up-to-date as the field develops.

Abstract: Automated feature extraction from MRI brain scans and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease are ongoing challenges. With advances in 3D imaging technology, 3D data acquisition is becoming more viable and efficient than its 2D counterpart. Rather than using feature-based vectors, in this paper, for the first time, we suggest a pipeline to extract novel covariance-based descriptors from the cortical surface using the Ricci energy optimization. The covariance descriptors are components of the nonlinear manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices, thus we focus on using the Gaussian radial basis function to apply manifold-based classification to the 3D shape problem. Applying this novel signature to the analysis of abnormal cortical brain morphometry allows for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. Experimental studies performed on about two hundred 3D MRI brain models, gathered from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our descriptors in achieving remarkable classification accuracy.

Abstract: Background
Older African American and Black adults are twice as likely to develop Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) and have the lowest level of ADRD health literacy compared to any other ethnic group in the United States. Low health literacy concerning ADRD negatively impacts African American and Black people in accessing adequate health care.
Objective
This study explored how 3 technological modalities—voice assistants, chatbots, and mobile apps—can assist older African American and Black adults in accessing ADRD information to improve ADRD health literacy. By testing each modality independently, the focus could be kept on understanding the unique needs and challenges of this population concerning the use of each modality when accessing ADRD-related information.
Methods
Using the Wizard of Oz usability testing method, we assessed the 3 modalities with a sample of 15 older African American and Black adults aged >55 years. The 15 participants were asked to interact with the 3 modalities to search for information on local events happening in their geographical area and search for ADRD-related health information.
Results
Our findings revealed that, across the 3 modalities, the content should avoid convoluted and complex language and give the possibility to save, store, and share it to be fully accessible by this population. In addition, content should come from credible sources, including information tailored to the participants’ cultural values, as it has to be culturally relevant for African American and Black communities. Finally, the interaction with the tool must be time efficient, and it should be adapted to the user’s needs to foster a sense of control and representation.
Conclusions
We conclude that, when designing ADRD-related interventions for African American and Black older adults, it proves to be crucial to tailor the content provided by the technology to the community’s values and construct an interaction with the technology that is built on African American and Black communities’ needs and demands.

Abstract: Introduction
Despite advancements in adoptive regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy, its application in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains constrained by challenges in ex vivo Treg selection and expansion with antigen specificity. Our previous findings demonstrated the bystander suppressive immunomodulatory mechanism of ex vivo expanded amyloid β-specific mouse Tregs in AD models, prompting inquiry into the efficacy of ex vivo expanded human Tregs in AD.
Methods
We developed an effective ex vivo expansion method for manufacturing amyloid β-specific human Tregs (Aβ-hTreg) and evaluated their safety and efficacy in 3xTg mouse models of AD and a phase 1 clinical trial with six AD patients. The phenotype of Aβ-hTreg was analyzed using single-cell transcriptomics. The clinical trial involved intravenous administration of Aβ-hTreg, with three patients receiving a low dose and three receiving a high dose. Exploratory assessments of effectiveness, including cognitive tasks and functional evaluations, were conducted ninety days post-treatment.
Results
Behavioral spatial learning and memory impairment, neuroinflammatory and amyloid pathology were dramatically ameliorated by single intrathecal administration of ex vivo expanded Aβ−hTreg to 3xTg AD mice. Single cell transcriptomics analysis revealed alterations in five key genes within a cluster of Tregs under antigen-specific manufacturing conditions. In the clinical trial with six AD patients, dose-limiting toxicity was experienced by none of the participants within five days of receiving GMP-grade Aβ-hTreg (VT301), indicating its good tolerability. Although exploratory assessments of effectiveness did not reach statistically significant values among the groups, these findings offer valuable insights for AD treatment and management, guiding the planning of the next phase of clinical trials.
Discussion
This study suggests that hTregs may modulate Alzheimer's disease pathology by suppressing neuroinflammation, while VT301 shows promise as a safe treatment option. However, further research is necessary to confirm its clinical efficacy and optimize treatment strategies.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta plaques, leading to memory loss, cognitive decline, and impaired autonomous behavior. Despite extensive research, an effective treatment remains elusive. The buildup of amyloid beta plaques (Aβ42) in the brain causes oxidative stress and disrupts normal molecular signaling, adversely affecting neuron function. Previous research has identified factors that can either exacerbate or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases. Our study aimed to uncover new factors involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Using Drosophila as a model organism, we employed the Gal4/UAS system to express human Aβ42 in the flies' retinal neurons which led to neurodegenerative changes in their compound eyes. To identify genetic modifiers, we conducted a screen by co-expressing microRNAs and found that miR-282 acts as a suppressor. Overexpressing miR-282 in the GMR > Aβ42 background reduced Aβ42-induced neurodegeneration. Further analysis using prediction tools and RNA interference experiments identified three potential downstream targets of miR-282: calpain-B, knot, and scabrous. Downregulating these genes via RNA interference in the GMR > Aβ42 background mitigated neurodegeneration. Our research highlights miR-282 as a novel molecule that may influence the progression of Alzheimer's disease, offering potential avenues for future therapeutic or diagnostic developments.

Abstract: Misfolded tau proteins play a critical role in the progression and pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Recent studies suggest that the spatio-temporal pattern of misfolded tau follows a reaction–diffusion type equation. However, the precise mathematical model and parameters that characterize the progression of misfolded protein across the brain remain incompletely understood. Here, we use deep learning and artificial intelligence to discover a mathematical model for the progression of Alzheimer’s disease using longitudinal tau positron emission tomography from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Specifically, we integrate physics informed neural networks (PINNs) and symbolic regression to discover a reaction–diffusion type partial differential equation for tau protein misfolding and spreading. First, we demonstrate the potential of our model and parameter discovery on synthetic data. Then, we apply our method to discover the best model and parameters to explain tau imaging data from 46 individuals who are likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and 30 healthy controls. Our symbolic regression discovers different misfolding models f(c) for two groups, with a faster misfolding for the Alzheimer’s group, f(c)=0.23c3−1.34c2+1.11c, than for the healthy control group, f(c)=−c3+0.62c2+0.39c. Our results suggest that PINNs, supplemented by symbolic regression, can discover a reaction–diffusion type model to explain misfolded tau protein concentrations in Alzheimer’s disease. We expect our study to be the starting point for a more holistic analysis to provide image-based technologies for early diagnosis, and ideally early treatment of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease and possibly other misfolding-protein based neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Background
The potential of biomarkers in the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is prominent. Acoustics may be useful in this context but the evaluation and weighting for specific acoustic parameters on continuous speech is missing. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the significance of acoustic parameters from acoustic speech analysis on continuous speech, as a diagnostic tool for clinical AD.
Methods
Applying PRISMA protocol, a comprehensive search was done in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL, from 1960 to January 2024. Cross-sectional studies comparing the acoustic speech analysis between AD patients and healthy controls (HC), were taken into account. The bias risk of the included studies were examined via JBI checklist. Using Review Manager v.5.4.1, the mean differences of acoustic speech parameters among AD and HC were weighted, and the pooled analysis and the heterogeneity statistics were conducted.
Results
In total, 1112 records (without duplicates) were obtained, and 11 papers with 7 acoustic parameters were included for this study, and 8 from 11 studies were identified with a low level of bias. Five from 7 acoustic parameters revealed significant differences among the two groups (p-values ≤ 0.01), in which for all rate-related and interruption-related acoustic parameters were the most prominent and less in temporal-related acoustic parameters.
Conclusions
Although a small number of acoustic parameters on continuous speech could be evaluated in the detection of clinical AD, the greatest potential of acoustic biomarkers for AD appeared to exist in two of three categories. Further contributions of high-quality studies are needed to support evidence for acoustics as biomarkers for AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), commonly known as senile dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease with insidious onset and gradually worsening course. The brain is particularly sensitive to senescence, and neuronal senescence is an important risk factor for the occurrence of AD. However, the exact pathogenesis between neuronal senescence and AD has not been fully elucidated so far. Neuronal senescence is characterized by the permanent stagnation of the cell cycle, and the changes in its structure, function, and microenvironment are closely related to the pathogenesis and progression of AD. In recent years, studies such as the Aβ cascade hypothesis and Tau protein phosphorylation have provided new strategies for the therapy of AD, but due to the complexity of the etiology of AD, there are still no effective treatment measures. This article aims to deeply analyze the pathogenesis between AD and neuronal senescence, and sort out various existing therapeutic methods, to provide new ideas and references for the clinical treatment of AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease, marked by cognitive decline and memory loss, involves BACE1 in generating Aβ peptides, making it a key drug target. This study screened 129 buckyball ligands using molecular docking, identifying three promising compounds (4_C26_d3hc, 8_C20_Ih, and 16_C24_d6d) that fit within the BACE1 binding site. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted thirteen BACE1 residues crucial for binding to buckyball ligands. The binding affinities of these ligands were also revealed via free energy perturbation (FEP), with 4_C26_d3hc demonstrating the greatest potential. This work lays the foundation for developing new BACE1 inhibitors using buckyball structures, offering a promising approach for Alzheimer’s therapy.

Abstract: Microalgae and cyanobacteria biomass can be cultivated in large amounts, producing a variety of bioactive compounds. As a result, various industries have begun to study the potential of this biomass in a wide range of applications such as biofuel production, environmental remediation for contaminated soil and water, food supplements, and as a source of feed for aquaculture. The cultivation conditions have a profound impact on microalgae biochemical composition. Therefore, the culture conditions must be tailored to the specific application of the biomass. This entails careful control of factors such as light exposure, nutrient concentration, and the application of stress conditions. To further enhance the value of microalgae biomass beyond its nutritional analysis, this review aims to explore the potential of the biomass as biofactories for producing antioxidant enzymes and inhibitors targeting Alzheimer's and diabetes diseases. Both chronic diseases are a growing concern due to an aging population and an increase in obesity rates. Microalgae when exposed to stressful conditions enhance the activity of antioxidant enzymes. However, further studies in the isolation and storage of these enzymes need to be performed. From the literature reviewed microalgae exhibited great potential in inhibiting key enzymes involved in Alzheimer's and Diabetes. The inhibitory potential was observed both in vitro and at a cellular level making them a promising natural alternative to current medication used to inhibit these enzymes.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), characterized by stages like Early and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI and LMCI), is a growing global concern. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for delaying its onset. Biomarkers like medical imaging and deep learning technology have been developed to address low early AD diagnosis accuracy. Deep learning algorithms can revolutionize the medical system by creating automatic diagnosis models and promoting artificial intelligence. However, existing studies have limitations, such as not considering complementarity between multiple features and ignoring spatial topological properties in the brain structure. It introduces two novel AD classification methods: Depth Double Deep Learning Method of Linear Attention Network (D3LM-LAN) based on Resnet-50, which incorporates a bilinear residual network structure, dual-channel data input, and hybrid attention module for enhanced PET and MRI multimodal data classification; and a machine learning approach using a Multi-Core Support Vector Machine (MLM-MCSVM) that improves softmax classifiers, optimizing data features and kernel functions via Particle Swarm Optimization. These models aid in effective intervention and personalized treatment planning, while the MLM-MCSVM model optimizes early detection with advanced feature selection. Together, these models enhance understanding of AD’s heterogeneity, supporting evidence-based clinical practices and patient care. The study uses MRI and PET data to conduct two- and four-class experiments, testing AD vs. Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, EMCI, and LMCI. D3LM-LAN achieved accuracies of 97.74%, 95.01%, 93.82% and 95.69 % in two-class experiments. MLM-MCSVM further improved classification performance, demonstrating enhanced early diagnosis capabilities with accuracies of 98.59%, 96.53%, 95.77%, and 96.32%.

Abstract: Objective
The objective is to analyze the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in patients with and without a diagnosis of different autoimmune diseases and the possible association between both pathologies.
Patients and methods
A multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was conducted to study the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease among patients diagnosed with various autoimmune diseases compared to the general population. Data from electronic medical records from the Castilla-La Mancha healthcare system were analyzed using Natural Language Processing through the Savana Manager® artificial intelligence clinical platform. A total of 1,028,356 patients were analyzed, including 28,920 individuals with Alzheimer's disease and 999,436 control patients.
Results
Out of the 12 autoimmune diseases analyzed, 5 showed a significant association with Alzheimer's disease with p < 0.05. Myasthenia gravis had an increased prevalence of AD with OR 1.49 (95% CI 1.11–2), systemic lupus erythematosus with OR 2.42 (95% CI 2.02–2.88), rheumatoid arthritis with OR 1.38 (95% CI 1.24–1.54), polymyalgia rheumatica with OR 2.01 (95% CI 1.08–2.23), and pernicious anemia with OR 2.06 (95% CI 1.59–2.66). The remaining autoimmune diseases analyzed did not show a higher prevalence of Alzheimer's disease compared to the general population.
Conclusions
There may be an association between certain systemic autoimmune diseases and Alzheimer's disease. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings, establish causality, and explore the underlying mechanisms of this association.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a neurological disorder that affects the elderly, caused by abnormal protein buildup in the brain. It leads to difficulties such as financial mismanagement, disorientation, behavioral changes, and repetitive speech. The existing methods use traditional features to detect the early signs of AD with low detection accuracy. The potential features have to be identified that represent best the patterns associated with alzheimers. Feature selection using ant lion optimization resolves the issue by using complementary information from hybrid features. The proposed HybridOpt pipeling for AD diagnosis combines the high level and low level features for early stage detection The objective of this work is to select efficient features from different deep networks, such as AlexNet, Googlenet, VGG16, ResNet, Efficient, DenseNet, and traditional texture features. Ant Lion Optimization is used to select the best feature among the deep network and traditional texture feature groups. Extensive experimentation on two highly challenging datasets called the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimage dataset and KAGGLE reveals that the proposed HybridOpt pipeline achieves an accuracy of 99% and 98.1% respectively.

Abstract: Background
Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, accounts for 60–80% of cases and its prevalence is projected to increase as aging populations grow. By 2050, the number of individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia worldwide is expected to reach 152 million. Genetics plays a significant role, contributing to about 70% of the overall risk, underscoring the importance of understanding the genetic basis for developing targeted interventions. This study presents a system that combines text mining and machine learning techniques to identify and prioritize prospective candidate genes for Alzheimer's and further classifies them into three association classes with weights.
Methods
The machine learning-based classifier was trained over a meticulously curated gold standard dataset and then rigorously validated utilizing a 10-fold cross-validation method, demonstrating its consistency across all the folds of the data. This developed ensemble learning system categorizes PubMed abstracts into three distinct groups: Yes, No, and Ambiguous using text mining and a Bayesian classification algorithm. The system further predicts disease-gene associations over unknown disease-specific prediction data by using the developed classifier.
Results
With an average accuracy of 87.33% and confidence level of 90.10% +/− 0.142, the protocol effectively extracted 2031 associated genes, of which 1162, 489 and 1439 belong to positive, negative and ambiguous classes respectively at the threshold of 0.9. In comparison between the established disease gene databases, our system identified 915 positive genes that had not been previously reported. One can use these positive genes for in-depth understanding and ambiguous genes for further exploration of their association with Alzheimer's disease.
Conclusions
The system's ability to generate accurate predictions demonstrates its robustness and provides valuable insights into the genetic factors of Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, this study contributes to existing knowledge and paves the way for future research in this field.

Abstract: Recent positive trials for novel disease modifying therapies of anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies represent a paradigm shift in the prevention and management of Alzheimer's disease, a relentlessly progressive and debilitating disease of old age. The reported efficacy of these new agents when given early in the disease trajectory is dependent on an early and accurate disease diagnosis, which is currently based on cerebrospinal fluid tests or/and neuro-imaging studies such as positron emission tomography. These confirmatory tests provide in vivo evidence of the pathological signature of Alzheimer's disease, of increased cerebral amyloid and tau burden and neurodegeneration. The emergence of blood-based biomarkers represents another breakthrough, offering a less invasive and scalable diagnostic tool that could be applied in both primary and specialist care settings, potentially revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease clinical pathways. However, healthcare systems face challenges in the adoption of these new technologies and therapies due to diagnostic and treatment capacity constraints, as well as financial and infrastructure requirements.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), in addition to being the most common cause of dementia, is very difficult to diagnose, with the 42-amino acid form of Aβ (Aβ-42) being one of the main biomarkers used for this purpose. Despite the enormous efforts made in recent years, the technologies available to determine Aβ-42 in human samples require sophisticated instrumentation, present high complexity, are sample and time-consuming, and are costly, highlighting the urgent need not only to develop new tools to overcome these limitations but to provide an early detection and treatment window for AD, which is a top-challenge. In recent years, micromotor (MM) technology has proven to add a new dimension to clinical biosensing, enabling ultrasensitive detections in short times and microscale environments. To this end, here an electrochemical immunoassay based on polypyrrole (PPy)/nickel (Ni)/platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) MM is proposed in a pioneering manner for the determination of Aβ-42 in left prefrontal cortex brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma samples from patients with AD. MM combines the high binding capacity of their immunorecognition external layer with self-propulsion through the catalytic generation of oxygen bubbles in the internal layer due to decomposition of hydrogen peroxide as fuel, allowing rapid bio-detection (15 min) of Aβ-42 with excellent selectivity and sensitivity (LOD = 0.06 ng/mL). The application of this disruptive technology to the analysis of just 25 μL of the three types of clinical samples provides values concordant with the clinical values reported, thus confirming the potential of the MM approach to assist in the reliable, simple, fast, and affordable diagnosis of AD by determining Aβ-42.

Abstract: The Wnt pathway stands out as a pivotal signal transduction pathway, operating through two distinct modes of signaling: the canonical/β-catenin pathway and the non-canonical pathway. Among these, the canonical pathway assumes a paramount role in various physiological and pathological processes within the human body. Particularly in the brain, Wnt exhibits involvement in fundamental physiological events including neuronal differentiation/survival, axonogenesis, neural stem cell regulation, synaptic plasticity, and cell cycle modulation. Notably, scientific evidence underscores the critical role of the Wnt pathway in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), correlating with its involvement in key pathological features such as tau tangles, Amyloid-β plaques, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cognitive impairments, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier integrity. This review aims to comprehensively explore the involvement and significance of Wnt signaling in Alzheimer's. Furthermore, it delves into recent advancements in research on Wnt signaling, spanning from preclinical investigations to clinical trials.

Abstract: Mice models of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) typically experience cognitive decline with age. G6PD overexpressing mice (G6PD-Tg) exhibit better protection from age-associated functional decline including improvements in metabolic and muscle functions as well as reduced frailty compared to their wild-type counterparts. Importantly G6PD-Tg mice show diminished accumulation of DNA oxidation in the brain at different ages in both males and females. To further explore the potential benefits of modulating the G6PD activity in neurodegenerative diseases, triple transgenic mice (3xTg G6PD) were generated, overexpressing APP, PSEN1, and G6PD genes. The cognitive decline characteristic of APP/PS1 mice was prevented in 3xTg G6PD mice, despite similar amyloid-β (Aβ) levels in the hippocampus. This challenges the dominant hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology and the majority of therapeutic efforts in the field, based on the notion that Aβ is pivotal in cognitive preservation. Notably, the antioxidant properties of G6PD led to a decrease in oxidative stress parameters, such as improved GSH/GSSG and GSH/CysSSG ratios, without major changes in oxidative damage markers. Additionally, metabolic changes in 3xTg G6PD mice increased brain energy status, countering the hypometabolism observed in Alzheimer's models. Remarkably, a higher respiratory exchange ratio suggested increased carbohydrate utilization. The relative failures of Aβ-targeted clinical trials have raised significant skepticism on the amyloid cascade hypothesis and whether the development of Alzheimer's drugs has followed the correct path. Our findings highlight the significance of targeting glucose-metabolizing enzymes rather than solely focusing on Aβ in Alzheimer's research, advocating for a deeper exploration of glucose metabolism's role in cognitive preservation.

Abstract: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) holds significance in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where cognitive impairment correlates with insufficient acetylcholine levels. AChE's role involves the breakdown of acetylcholine, moderating cholinergic neuron activity to prevent overstimulation and signal termination. Hence, inhibiting AChE emerges as a potential treatment avenue for AD. A library of 2500 compounds, derived from 25 traditionally used medicinal plants, was constructed using the IMPAAT database of traditional medicinal plants. The canonical SMILES of these compounds were collected and underwent virtual screening based on physicochemical properties, with subsequent determination of IC50 values for the screened compounds followed by analysis using machine learning (ML). Subsequently, a molecular docking study elucidated both binding affinity and interactions between these compounds and AChE. The top three compounds, exhibiting robust binding affinities, underwent MM-GBSA analysis for molecular docking validation, succeeded by pharmacokinetics and toxicity evaluations to gauge safety and efficacy. These three compounds underwent MD simulation studies to assess protein–ligand complex conformational stability. Additionally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) was employed to ascertain HOMO, LUMO, energy gap, and molecular electrostatic potential. Among 2500 compounds, physicochemical properties-based virtual screening identified 80 with good properties, of which 32 showed promising IC50 values. Molecular docking studies of these 32 compounds revealed various binding energies with AChE, with the best three compounds (CID 102267534, CID 15161648, CID 12441) selected for further analysis. MM-GBSA studies confirmed the promising binding energies of these three compounds, validating the molecular docking study. Further, the MD simulation studies have confirmed the structural and conformational stability of these three protein–ligand complexes. Finally, DFT calculations revealed favorable chemical features of these compounds. Thus, we can conclude that these three compounds (CID 102267534, CID 15161648, CID 12441) may inhibit the activity of AChE and can be useful as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Objectives
Based on the literature, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) parameters were related to neurocognitive functions such as memory, learning, language ability, and executive functions. The present study aims to evaluate the associations between TBM indices with executive functions, memory, language, and visuospatial abilities and the value of TBM in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among individuals with Alzheimer's disease continuum and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
Methods
The authors used ADNI-memory (ADNI-MEM), ADNI-executive functions (ADNI-EF), ADNI-language (ADNI-LAN), and ADNI-visuospatial (ADNI-VS) composite scores. TBM parameters, including measure 1, which represents average within a statistically defined region-of-interest inside the temporal lobes and measure 2 which indicates average within an anatomically defined region-of-interest including bilateral temporal lobes were utilized in the current study. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26, and Pearson’s correlation, Bonferroni’s correction, and multiple linear regression were utilized for data analysis. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
After screening 800 participants, 270 (151 men, 119 women) were selected for a study with TBM scores and cognition-related assessments at 6, 12, and 24 months. Groups included healthy controls (n=53), MCI (n=158), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) (n=59). TBM indices correlated with cognitive scores in MCI and AD groups but not healthy controls. Changes in TBM indices and cognitive scores were significantly correlated in MCI and AD groups over 24 months. TBM indices were weak predictors of cognitive decline at all time points.
Conclusions
TBM can help physicians diagnose MCI and AD early. However, TBM could not strongly predict cognitive functions decline at all time points.

Abstract: Fortified foods have garnered significant attention as potential therapeutic strategies with less adverse effects and ready accessibility. However, precise formulation is required to optimize their beneficial effects. Our study aimed to unravel the mechanisms of a functional protein beverage, hydroxymethylbutyrate and glucosamine fortified whey protein drink (HG-WPD), as a possible intervention combatting sarcopenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental assays. This study investigates the molecular pathways through which HG-WPD acts, by combining in silico and in vitro analyses. Our in silico study predicted the important target proteins, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), linked to both diseases. The molecular docking analysis showed that hydroxymethylbutyrate and glucosamine exhibited a notable binding affinity to these proteins, therefore suggesting their possible use as multi-target medicinal agents. In vitro studies on C2C12 myotubes showed that HG-WPD reduced dexamethasone-induced cell death highlighting its potential anti-sarcopenic actions. Furthermore, confirming their possible function in reducing cognitive impairment in AD, the antioxidant tests showed great activity of both substances. The results imply that HG-WPD is potentially effective for future therapeutic approaches as a functional food product with dual benefits in combatting sarcopenia and AD.

Abstract: Over the past years, Alzheimer's disease has emerged as a serious concern for people's health. Researchers are facing challenges in effectively categorizing and diagnosing the different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current promising studies have shown that multimodal Neuroimaging has the potential to offer vital information about the structural and functional alterations associated with Alzheimer's. Using advanced computational techniques, Machine Learning calculations have been demonstrated to be highly precise in deciphering patterns and connections within the multimodal Neuroimaging data, eventually aiding in the arrangement of Alzheimer's illness stages. This research aimed to survey the adequacy of Machine Learning techniques in correctly categorizing stages of Alzheimer's disease by working on multiple neuroimaging modalities. In this review, a detailed analysis was carried out on the classification algorithms included. The study specifically examines publications published between 2016 and 2024. From the review, it was found that deep learning frameworks are more robust in Alzheimer's disease classification.

Abstract: Dementia arises from various brain-affecting diseases and injuries, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most prevalent, impacting around 55 million people globally. Current clinical diagnosis often relies on biomarkers indicative of Alzheimer’s distinctive features. Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as a cost-effective, user-friendly, and safe biomarker for early Alzheimer’s detection. This study utilizes EEG signals processed with Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to generate spectrograms, facilitating visualization of EEG signal properties. Leveraging the Brainlat database, we propose SpectroCVT-Net, a novel convolutional vision transformer architecture incorporating channel attention mechanisms. SpectroCVT-Net integrates convolutional and attention mechanisms to capture local and global dependencies within spectrograms. Comprising feature extraction and classification stages, the model enhances Alzheimer’s disease classification accuracy compared to transfer learning methods, achieving 92.59 ± 2.3% accuracy across Alzheimer’s, healthy controls, and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). This article introduces a new architecture and evaluates its efficacy with unconventional data for Alzheimer’s diagnosis, contributing: SpectroCVT-Net, tailored for EEG spectrogram classification without reliance on transfer learning; a convolutional vision transformer (CVT) module in the classification stage, integrating local feature extraction with attention heads for global context analysis; Grad-CAM analysis for network decision insight, identifying critical layers, frequencies, and electrodes influencing classification; and enhanced interpretability through spectrograms, illuminating key brain wave contributions to Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia, and healthy control classifications, potentially aiding clinical diagnosis and management.

Abstract: The cerebrospinal fluid of 21 subjects who received a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as of 22 pathological controls has been collected and analysed by Raman spectroscopy (RS). We investigated whether the Raman spectra could be used to distinguish AD from controls, after a preprocessing procedure. We applied machine learning to a set of topological descriptors extracted from the spectra, achieving a high classification accuracy of 86%. Our experimentation indicates that RS and topological analysis may be a reliable and effective combination to confirm or disprove a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. The following steps will aim at leveraging the intrinsic interpretability of the topological data analysis to characterize the AD subtypes, e.g. by identifying the bands of the Raman spectrum relevant for AD detection, possibly increasing and/or confirming the knowledge about the precise molecular events and biological pathways behind the Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and its comorbidities pose a heavy disease burden globally, and its treatment remains a major challenge. Identifying the protective and risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, as well as its possible underlying molecular processes, can facilitate the development of interventions that can slow its progression. Observational studies and randomized controlled trials have provided some evidence regarding potential risk factors for Alzheimer's disease; however, the results of these studies vary. Mendelian randomization is a novel epidemiological methodology primarily used to infer causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. Many Mendelian randomization studies have identified potential causal relationships between Alzheimer's disease and certain diseases, lifestyle habits, and biological exposures, thus providing valuable data for further mechanistic studies and the development and implementation of clinical prevention strategies. However, the results and data from Mendelian randomization studies must be interpreted based on comprehensive evidence. Moreover, the existing Mendelian randomization studies on the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease have some limitations that are worth exploring. Therefore, the aim of this review was to summarize the available evidence on the potential protective and risk factors for Alzheimer's disease by assessing published Mendelian randomization studies on Alzheimer's disease, and to provide new perspectives on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: After a number of failed drug studies on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) over the past decade, clinical trials of AD started to show encouraging results and were approved or pending approval for clinical use. However, controversies on the clinically meaningful benefits and risks of brain edema and microhemorrhages have reminded us to think further about monitoring treatment and developing new drug targets. The goal of this review is to find insights from clinical trials that aimed at two key pathological features of AD, i.e., amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau protein, and to explore other targets such as anti-inflammation in AD. The complex pathophysiology of AD may require combination therapies rather than monotherapy. Throughout the course of AD, multiple pathways are disrupted, presenting a multitude of possible therapeutic targets for designing prevention and intervention for AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that causes memory loss and cognitive decline in older people. There is increasing evidence suggesting that gut microbiota alteration is a cause of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. This review explores the link between gut dysbiosis and the development of Alzheimer's disease contributing to neuroinflammation, amyloid β accumulation, and cognitive decline. We examine the recent studies that illustrate the gut-brain axis (GBA) as a bidirectional communication between the gut and brain and how its alteration can influence neurological health. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of probiotic supplementation as a management approach to restore gut microbiota balance, and ultimately improve cognitive function in AD patients. Based on current research findings, this review aims to provide insights into the promising role of probiotics in Alzheimer's disease management and the need for further investigation into microbiota-targeted interventions.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment will progress to Alzheimer’s disease, thus how to effectively diagnose Alzheimer’s disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment using the clinical tabular data and Magnetic Resonance Images of the brain together has been a major concern of researches. Deep multi-modal learning-based methods can improve Alzheimer’s disease diagnostic accuracy compared to the single modality-based methods. However, most existing multi-modal fusion methods only focus on learning global features fusion from image and clinical tabular data by concatenation, lacking the ability to jointly analyze and integrate global–local information of image with clinical tabular data. To address these limitations, this paper explored a novel Multi-Modal Global–Local Fusion method to perform multi-modal Alzheimer’s disease classification through 3D Magnetic Resonance Images and clinical tabular data. Specifically, we adopt a global module that uses concatenation to fuse features to learn the global information. Moreover, we design an attention-based local module which encourages clinical tabular features to guide the learning of local 3D Magnetic Resonance Images information, thus, enhancing the power of features fusion from each modality. Our method considers both global and local information of the two modalities for multi-modal fusion. Experiment results show that our method in this paper is highly effective in combining 3D Magnetic Resonance Images and clinical tabular data for Alzheimer’s disease classification with accuracy of 86.34% and 86.77% in ADNI and OASIS-1 datasets respectively, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. Detailed ablation experiments are conducted to highlight the contribution of various components. code is available at: https://github.com/nananana0701/MMGLF.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are often casually linked to protein aggregation and inclusion. As the origins of those proteinopathies have been biochemically traced and genetically mapped, genetically engineered animal models carrying the specific mutations or variants are widely used for investigating the etiology of these diseases, as well as for testing potential therapeutics. This article focuses on the mouse models of Alzheimer disease and closely related frontotemporal dementia, particularly the ones that have provided most valuable knowledge, or are in a trajectory of doing so. More importantly, some of the major findings from these models are summarized, based on the recent single-cell transcriptomics, multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics studies. While no model is perfect, it is hoped that the new insights from these models and the practical use of these models will continue to help to establish a path forward.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are common neurodegenerative diseases with multifaceted etiology. Nutritional and metabolic abnormalities are frequently implicated in PD and AD. In this observational study, we analyzed a series of nutritional markers, and aimed to understand their association with AD and PD risk.
Methods
A total of 424 PD patients, 314 AD patients, and 388 healthy controls were included. Nutritional markers including Hemoglobin A1c, vitamin B12, folate, apolipoprotein B (ApoB), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), uric acid and homocysteine (HCY) were measured. Significance for odds ratios examining was P < 0.0045 after bonferroni correction.
Results
Multifactor risk analysis showed that ApoB, LDL, and TC reduce PD risk, while HCY increase PD risk. ApoA1 and HCY are protective and risk factors for AD, respectively.
Conclusion
The cross-sectional study demonstrates that HCY and lipid metabolism markers are associated with PD and AD risks. Our findings support the involvement of one-carbon metabolism and lipid metabolism disturbance in PD and AD.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia that leads to memory loss and impairment, which afects patients’ lives badly. It is not curable yet, but its progression can be slowed down if detected at earlier stages. In this research study, we propose a transfer learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into one of four stages of Alzheimer's disease. One of the major limitations of the deep learning-based classification model is the non-availability of healthcare datasets related to AD. The widely used Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset has a major class imbalance issue. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based data augmentation technique to overcome the data imbalance. This promotes the investigation of applying GANs to generate synthetic samples for minority classes in Alzheimer's disease datasets to enhance classification performance. The results show the progression in the overall classification process of AD.

Abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that metabolic disorders such as obesity are implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathological buildup of lipids in microglia is regarded as a key indicator in brain aging and the progression of AD, yet the mechanisms behind this process remain uncertain. The adipokine ANGPTL4 is strongly associated with obesity and is thought to play a role in the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. This study utilized RNA sequencing to identify differential expression in lipid-accumulating BV2 microglia and investigated the potential mechanism through ANGPTL4 overexpression in BV2. Subsequently, animal models and clinical data were employed to further explore alterations in circulating ANGPTL4 levels in AD. RNA sequencing results indicated a correlation between ANGPTL4 and microglial lipid accumulation. The overexpression of ANGPTL4 in microglia resulted in increased secretion of inflammatory factors, elevated oxidative stress levels, and diminished antiviral capacity. Furthermore, when simulating the coexistence of AD and obesity through combined treatment with Amyloid-Beta 1–42 peptide (Aβ) and Free Fatty Acids (FFA) in vitro, we observed a notable upregulation of ANGPTL4 expression, highlighting its potential role in the interplay between AD and obesity. In vivo experiments, we also observed a significant increase in ANGPTL4 expression in the hippocampus and plasma of APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type controls. This was accompanied by heightened microglial activation and reduced expression of longevity-related genes in the hippocampus. Clinical data from the UK Biobank indicated that plasma ANGPTL4 levels are elevated in patients with AD when compared to healthy controls. Moreover, significantly higher ANGPTL4 levels were observed in obese AD patients relative to their non-obese counterparts. Our findings suggest that ANGPTL4-mediated microglial aging may serve as a crucial link between AD and obesity, proposing ANGPTL4 as a potential biomarker for AD.

Abstract: Huperzine A (HupA) is used in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy for its effective inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and enhancement of cholinergic neuronal function. However, direct oral administration and injection of HupA cause side effects like nausea, anorexia, and rapid metabolism. Using a tripolymer, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate (PBVHx), from the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family synthesized via synthetic biology, we present a novel AD therapy strategy with peritoneally administered PBVHx microspheres loaded with HupA (HupA-PBVHxMs). This approach extends HupA's metabolic duration in the blood and brain, enhancing AChE inhibition efficacy. Uniformly sized HupA-PBVHxMs, created using microfluidics and rotary evaporation, show up to 70.4 % drug encapsulation efficiency, sustained HupA release for 40 days, reduced neurotoxicity from Aβ25–35, and maintained in vivo HupA supply and AChE inhibition for over 20 days. In cognitive tests, HupA-PBVHxMs improved function in AD mice. Thus, PBVHx microspheres with slower HupA release and lower biotoxicity offer a superior platform for sustained AChE inhibitor release, outperforming commercial PLGA microspheres.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is the most common and costly chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with the highest global public health impact. However, diagnosing this neurodegenerative disorder is challenging and often relies on traditional clinical diagnostics techniques applied after symptoms appear, which are complex, costly, time-consuming, and potentially intrusive methods. This hinders the development of effective tools for Point-of-Care applications. To address these limitations, researchers have been developing several biosensing techniques utilizing biosensors, which have excellent selectivity and sensitivity for detecting Alzheimer's disease biomarkers at an early stage more efficiently and promptly. This comprehensive study focuses on promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease detection in various bio-fluids, as well as the accompanying obstacles and advantages. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of current biosensing techniques, focusing on electrochemical and optical biosensors, which are well-known for their exceptional sensitivity and selectivity in detecting Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. These biosensors facilitate the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in point-of-care testing, thereby enhancing point-of-care applications for Alzheimer's disease. We also explore bioelectronic tongues and bioelectronic noses as innovative, non-invasive tools for detecting biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease, which further facilitates point-of-care applications for Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of tau proteins and amyloid-β, leading to neuronal death and cognitive impairment. Recent studies have implicated aging pathways, including dysregulation of tau and cellular senescence in AD pathogenesis. In AD brains, tau protein, which normally stabilizes microtubules, becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles. These tau aggregates impair neuronal function and are propagated across the brain’s neurocircuitry. Meanwhile, the number of senescent cells accumulating in the aging brain is rising, releasing a pro-inflammatory SASP responsible for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This review explores potential therapeutic interventions for AD targeting tau protein and senescent cells, and tau −directed compounds, senolytics, eliminating senescent cells, and agents that modulate the SASP-senomodulators. Ultimately, a combined approach that incorporates tau-directed medications and targeted senescent cell-based therapies holds promise for reducing the harmful impact of AD’s shared aging pathways.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a significant health challenge worldwide, and the development of effective treatments necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its pathophysiology. Mouse models have been instrumental in offering insights into the crucial pathogenesis of AD. However, current models rarely recapitulate all aspects of AD pathology in patients; thus, translating the findings from mouse to human clinical trials has proved to be complex. In this review, we outline the development of some prevalently used AD mice, with a particular emphasis on the latest advances in newly generated models. In addition, we discuss the advantages and limitations in mouse models of AD and their applications in blood-based biomarkers. Finally, we speculate on potential future research directions.

Abstract: Summary
The complex pathobiology of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses significant challenges to therapeutic and preventative interventions. Despite these difficulties, genomics and related disciplines are allowing fundamental mechanistic insights to emerge with clarity, particularly with the introduction of high-resolution sequencing technologies. After all, the disrupted processes at the interface between DNA and gene expression, which we call the broken AD genome, offer detailed quantitative evidence unrestrained by preconceived notions about the disease. In addition to highlighting biological pathways beyond the classical pathology hallmarks, these advances have revitalized drug discovery efforts and are driving improvements in clinical tools. We review genetic, epigenomic, and gene expression findings related to AD pathogenesis and explore how their integration enables a better understanding of the multicellular imbalances contributing to this heterogeneous condition. The frontiers opening on the back of these research milestones promise a future of AD care that is both more personalized and predictive.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent type of dementia, presenting a substantial danger to the health and well-being of the aged population. It has arisen as a significant public health problem with considerable socioeconomic repercussions. Unfortunately, no effective treatments or diagnostic tools are available for Alzheimer's disease. Despite substantial studies on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's, the molecular pathways underpinning its development remain poorly understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) vary in size from 200 nucleotides to over 100 kilobytes and have been found to play critical roles in various vital biological processes that play critical in developing Alzheimer's disease. This review intends to examine the functions of long non-coding RNAs in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and their participation in immunological responses associated with AD.

The lack of MRI data and imbalance pose significant challenges in medical research; therefore, more data must be collected. Machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning (RL) and deep learning has demonstrated excellent capabilities for analyzing and classifying medical images. One challenge in the field of data augmentation is the dependence of the augmentation method on the dataset. The proposed method uses reinforcement learning and receives feedback during data augmentation to mitigate this dependency. Initially, the images were classified using a pre-trained deep neural network, while simultaneously training a secondary classifier. Based on the secondary classifier, each output is assigned a score that is used as a reward signal to transition to a new state. Positive scores were awarded for correct predictions, while negative scores were assigned for incorrect predictions. In this study, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset was utilized, and the obtained results were compared with other existing techniques. The experimental findings reveal that the proposed method, utilizing the ADNI dataset, achieves higher accuracy than other existing techniques in various evaluation metrics, including AUC (%), SPE (%), SEN (%), and ACC (%). The method obtained precision levels of 0.950, 0.908, 0.931, and 0.902, demonstrating its superior performance.

Abstract: β-amyloid-targeting antibodies represent the first generation of effective causal treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be considered historical research milestones. Their effect sizes, side effects, implementation challenges and costs, however, have stimulated debates about their overall value. In this position statement academic clinicians of the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC) discuss the critical relevance of introducing these new treatments in clinical care now. Given the complexity of AD it is unlikely that molecular single-target treatments will achieve substantially larger effects than those seen with current β-amyloid-targeting antibodies. Larger effects will most likely only be achieved incrementally by continuous optimization of molecular approaches, patient selection and combinations therapies. To be successful in this regard, drug development must be informed by the use of innovative treatments in real world practice, because full understanding of all facets of novel treatments requires experience and data of real-world care beyond those of clinical trials. Regarding the antibodies under discussion we consider their effects meaningful and potential side effects manageable. We assume that the number of eventually treated patient will only be a fraction of all early AD patients due to narrow eligibility criteria and barriers of access. We strongly endorse the use of these new compound in clinical practice in selected patients with treatment documentation in registries. We understand this as a critical step in advancing the field of AD treatment, and in shaping the health care systems for the new area of molecular-targeted treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a primary cause of dementia that affects millions of people worldwide and its prevalence is likely to increase largely in the coming decades. Multiple complex pathways, such as oxidative stress, tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology, and cholinergic dysfunction, are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The conventional treatments provide only symptomatic relief and not a complete cure for the disease. On the other hand, recent studies have looked into the possibility of flavonoids as an effective therapeutic strategy for treating AD. Quercetin, a well-known flavonol, has been extensively studied for AD treatment. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the pharmacokinetics properties of quercetin and its modes of action, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloidogenic, and neuroprotective properties, which are beneficial in treating AD. It also highlights the nano delivery systems of quercetin, including liposomes, nanostructures lipid carriers, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, microemulsions, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, and nanoparticles reported for AD treatment. The remarkable potential of quercetin nanocarriers has been reflected in enhancing its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, clinical studies must be conducted to explore it as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Background
Combined art activities can improve the neural network function within various brain regions involved in emotions, cognition, and behavior, thereby preventing or reversing cognitive decline. However, few studies have systematically examined its effects. Furthermore, the impact of nurse-led art-based cognitive intervention on cognitive and psychological health is unclear.
Objective
To evaluate the effects of a nurse-led staged integral art-based cognitive intervention in older adults on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.
Design
This was a randomized wait-list controlled trial with allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors and data analysts. All data were collected between April 2021 and January 2023 and analyzed from January to March 2023.
Setting
One memory clinic and four medical partnership communities.
Participants
A total of 144 participants with subjective or objective memory decline (aged ≥60 years).
Methods
Participants were randomized into an intervention group (n = 72) and a wait-list control group (n = 72), in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group underwent a 16-week, 24-session nurse-led staged integral art-based cognitive intervention program, which was based on neurocognitive function training patterns. The control group underwent the program after the follow-up assessment. General and specific domains of cognitive function and other health-related outcomes were measured at baseline (T0), immediately after the intervention (T1), and at the 6-month follow-up (T2).
Results
Of the 144 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.6 [5.8] years; 50 [34.7 %] males and 94 [65.3 %] females), 130 and 115 completed the questionnaires at T1 and T2, respectively. The average attendance rate in the intervention group was 86.0 %. At T1, the intervention group showed greater improvement than the control group did in general cognitive functions (MoCA, between-group mean difference, 1.4 [95 % CIs, 0.4 to 2.5], p = 0.009). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to the control group in language, memory, quality of life, sleep quality and physical activity level at T1. Statistically significant group differences remained in sleep quality (PSQI, between-group mean difference, −1.3 [95 % CIs, −2.5 to −0.1], p = 0.035) at the 6-month follow-up.
Conclusions
In this randomized controlled trial of a nurse-led staged integral art-based cognitive intervention program, older adults on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum who participated in the program experienced improved cognition and psychological health.
Registration
This study was registered with ChiCTR.org (ChiCTR2100044959) on April 3, 2021.

Abstract: Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that seriously affects the quality of the elderly’s lives worldwide. The main pathological features of AD are amyloid plaques formed by β-amyloid (Aβ) and neuronal fibrillary tangls (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. The formation process of these pathological features is closely related to inflammatory response, so anti-inflammatory treatment has become a potential treatment for AD. In recent years, more and more research has shown that the anti-inflammatory therapy can relieve the symptoms of AD and improve cognitive function, which provides a valuable research direction for the treatment of AD strategy. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the hotspots and development trends of AD anti-inflammatory research is important for promoting the further development of this field and improving the quality of life of patients.
Methods
This study used bibliometric methods, with AD and anti-inflammatory as key words, collected 7638 AD anti-inflammatory studies collected in Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) literature database since 2000, and conducted an in-depth analysis of the research hotspots and potential trends in this field.
Results
The depth and breadth of AD anti-inflammatory research are in the stage of rapid development, and the hot focus is on exploring the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD, especially the interaction of microglia in the neuroinflammatory mechanism. Secondly, the treatment effect and potential risks of anti-inflammatory drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on AD are also the focus of research. Therefore, researchers have carried out a series of animal experiments and prospective clinical studies on anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of AD, forming a comprehensive research system from basic research to clinical research. As for the future development trend, we believe that the further exploration of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD will still be one of the key directions, and the application of big data and artificial intelligence technology is expected to provide strong support for the association between inflammation and AD progression. Moreover, the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs for the inflammatory mechanism of AD will be another major trend for future research. At the same time, personalized treatment strategies and alternative supplements of medicine will also become one of the hotspots of future research. Through the comprehensive use of anti-inflammatory drugs, nutritional supplements, lifestyle intervention and other means, more comprehensive and effective treatment plans for AD patients are expected.
Conclusion
This research analyzes the overall development trend of AD anti-inflammatory research field since 2000, and provides a comprehensive perspective for the progress of AD anti-inflammatory research. Overall, the field of AD anti-inflammatory research is facing a broad development prospect. In the future, with further research and technological advances, we have resason to expect more effective and safer treatment options for AD patients to help them improve their quality of life and delay disease progression.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathologic entity characterized by the abnormal presence of tau and macromolecular Aβ deposition that leads to the degeneration or death of neurons. In addition to that, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) has a multifaceted role in the process of AD development, where it can be used as both a marker and a target. G6PD activity is dysregulated due to its contribution to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. In this context, the current review presents a vivid depiction of recent findings on the relationship between AD progression and changes in the expression or activity of G6PD. The efficacy of the proposed G6PD-based therapeutics has been demonstrated in multiple studies using AD mouse models as representative animal model systems for cognitive decline and neurodegeneration associated with this disease. Innovative therapeutic insights are made for the boosting of G6PD activity via novel innovative nanotechnology and microfluidics tools in drug administration technology. Such approaches provide innovative methods of surpassing the blood-brain barrier, targeting step-by-step specific neural pathways, and overcoming biochemical disturbances that accompany AD. Using different nanoparticles loaded with G6DP to target specific organs, e.g., G6DP-loaded liposomes, enhances BBB penetration and brain distribution of G6DP. Many nanoparticles, which are used for different purposes, are briefly discussed in the paper. Such methods to mimic BBB on organs on-chip offer precise disease modeling and drug testing using microfluidic chips, requiring lower sample amounts and producing faster findings compared to conventional techniques. There are other contributions to microfluid in AD that are discussed briefly. However, there are some limitations accompanying microfluidics that need to be worked on to be used for AD. This study aims to bridge the gap in understanding AD with the synergistic use of promising technologies; microfluid and nanotechnology for future advancements.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects elderly, and its incidence is continuously increasing across the globe. Unfortunately, despite decades of research, a complete cure for Alzheimer's disease continues to elude us. The current medications are mainly symptomatic and slow the disease progression but do not result in reversal of all disease pathologies. The growing body of knowledge on the factors responsible for the onset and progression of the disease has resulted in the identification of new targets that could be targeted for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This has opened new vistas for treatment of Alzheimer's disease that have moved away from chemotherapeutic agents modulating a single target to biologics and combinations that acted on multiple targets thereby offering better therapeutic outcomes. This review discusses the emerging directions in therapeutic interventions against Alzheimer's disease highlighting their merits that promise to change the treatment paradigm and challenges that limit their clinical translation.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a memory-related disease that occurs in the human brain where neurons become degenerative. It is an evolved form of dementia that deteriorates over time. Machine learning, an extended version of deep learning, has appeared as an optimistic strategy for AD detection. Regardless, the existing AD detection approaches have yet to acquire the expected accuracy, mainly due to unreasonable data for training and testing. In this paper, we present the Federated Deep Convolutional Neural Network Alzheimer Detection Schemes (FDCNN-AS), specifically designed for varying age groups. FDCNN-AS is an efficient framework that contains architecture, algorithm flow, and implementation. It manages AD data from various laboratories and processes it in additional clinics. Our method mixes training data models from different types of data such as positron emission tomography, summed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, blood tests, and questionnaires about synaptic degeneration. Further, we look at some restrictions that have yet to be addressed in AD detection. These include seeing AD at different ages, extrapolating the severity of brain damage, comparing treatment and recovery rates, and finding benign and malignant ranges in AD data that has been collected. To ensure secure and privacy-preserving learning, we execute FDCNN-AS within a federated learning environment that concerns considerable laboratories and clinics. Within this setup, we operate the generic deep convolutional neural network. The experimental results indicate that FDCNN-AS performs optimally, reaching a remarkable 99% accuracy in detecting dementia Alzheimer's in the human brain.

Abstract: Alzheimer's is a degenerative brain cell disease that affects around 5.8 million people globally. The progressive neurodegenerative disease known as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), affects the frontal cortex, the part of the brain in charge of memory, language, and cognition. As a result, researchers are utilizing a variety of machine-learning techniques to create an automated method for AD detection. The massive data collected during ROI and biomarker identification takes longer to handle using current methods. This study uses metaheuristic-tuned deep learning to detect the AD-affected region. The research utilizes advanced deep learning and image processing techniques to enhance early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and prompt therapy. The capacity of deep neural networks to extract complex patterns from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans makes them indispensable in the diagnosis of AD since they allow the detection of minor aberrations and complex alterations in brain structure and composition. An adaptive histogram approach processes the collected photographs, and a weighted median filter is used in place of the noisy pixels. The next step is to identify the issue region using a deep convolution network-based clustering segmentation process. A correlated information theory approach is used to extract various textural and statistical features from the separated regions. Lastly, the selected features are probed by the fly-optimized densely linked convolution neural networks. The method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in sensitivity (15.52%), specificity (15.62%), accuracy (9.01%), error rate (11.29%), and F-measure (10.52%) for recognizing AD-impacted regions in MRI scans using the Kaggle dataset.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative problem with progressive loss of memory and other cognitive function disorders resulting in the imbalance of neurotransmitter activity and signaling progression, which poses the need of the potential therapeutic target to improve the intracellular signaling cascade brought by kinases. Protein kinase plays a significant and multifaceted role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, by targeting pathological mechanisms like tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta production and synaptic dysfunction. In this review, we thoroughly explore the essential protein kinases involved in Alzheimer's disease, detailing their physiological roles, regulatory impacts, and the newest inhibitors and compounds that are progressing into clinical trials. All the findings of studies exhibited the promising role of kinase inhibitors in the management of Alzheimer's disease. However, it still poses the need of addressing current challenges and opportunities involved with this disorder for the future perspective of kinase inhibitors in the management of Alzheimer's disease. Further study includes the development of biomarkers, combination therapy, and next-generation kinase inhibitors with increased potency and selectivity for its future prospects.

Abstract: Behavioral testing is an essential tool for evaluating cognitive function and dysfunction in preclinical research models. This is of special importance in the study of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, the reproducibility of classic behavioral assays is frequently compromised by interstudy variation, leading to ambiguous conclusions about the behavioral markers characterizing the disease. Here, we identify age- and genotype-driven differences between 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic control mice using a low-cost, highly customizable behavioral assay that requires little human intervention. Through behavioral phenotyping combining both supervised and unsupervised behavioral classification methods, we are able to validate the preventative effects of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A in a rodent model of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as the partially ameliorating effects of candidate drugs nebivolol and cabozantinib.

Abstract: Dihydroquercetin is a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities. Dihydroquercetin exhibits a great neuroprotector promise in Alzheimer’s disorder via preventing the aggregation of amyloid-beta-peptide-Aβ(1–42). The goal of the study was to create dihydroquercetin-loaded-chitosan nanoparticles (DHQ-CS NPs) loaded to a mucoadhesive, thermosensitive in-situ gel for direct nasal administration to cure Alzheimer’s disorder. Loading drug in chitosan nanoparticles and incorporation into thermosensitive gel enhanced residence time and reduced mucociliary-clearance. Different in-vitro-physicochemical-characteristics of gels and nanoparticles-characterization were used to evaluate the formulations. The therapeutic effectiveness of DHQ-CS NPs gel was evaluated behaviorally, biochemically and histopathologically in Alzheimer’s-rat-model compared to intranasal DHQ gel. The small particles-size was obtained = 235.3 nm of DHQ-CS NPs. The DHQ-CS NPs gel demonstrated a greater release rate compared to the raw DHQ gel. Additionally, the nasal-administration of the DHQ-CS NPs gel showed better In-vivo results compared to DHQ gel, through improvement of memory and learning deficits and also the exploratory behavior and new object memory in streptozotocin induced-Alzheimer rats. Biochemically, the intranasal DHQ-CS NPs gel, showed reduced both Aβ-protein formation and tau protein hyperphosphorylation, inhibition of acetylcholine esterase activity and oxidative stress in the brain with increase of total antioxidants in the brain and serum, compared to DHQ gel. Histopathologically, the DHQ-CS NPs nasal gel produced improvement in the hippocampal and cerebral cortex structures, being comparable to the normal group. Consequently, the intranasal DHQ-CS NPs loaded in-situ gel seems to be a promising therapeutic formulation for Alzheimer’s disease medication.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, epitomizes the intricate interplay between genetic predisposition and molecular pathology, resulting in the relentless deterioration of neuronal structures within the brain. Characterized by the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles, this condition disrupts synaptic connections, leading to profound cognitive impairment. The utilization of medicinal herbs in the treatment of AD has garnered considerable attention within scientific research due to their potential neuroprotective and therapeutic properties. The World Health Organization has long noted and brought to the attention of many countries the growing public interest in medicinal plants and their products to cure various disorders, including AD due to their potential neuroprotective properties. The ethnomedicinal relevance of the plant Woodfordia fruticosa Kurtz has been reflected in the art of Ayurveda and India's traditional healing system, which reveals its widespread use in Ayurvedic treatments. Numerous chemical compounds found in Woodfordia fruticosa (WF) have been shown to be biologically active against the predisposing factors of AD. The flower extract of WF is particularly effective in inhibiting key enzymes like AChE and BuChE that are involved in AD, while its leaf and stem extracts also contribute to this effect. In vivo studies demonstrate that the flower extract can reverse memory impairment and reduce elevated enzyme levels in animal models. This review highlights the comprehensive potential of Woodfordia fruticosa Kurz in AD management, the multifaceted activities of WF, spanning enzyme inhibition, cholinesterase inhibition, and neuroprotection, underscore its promise as a natural therapeutic agent for AD.

Abstract: Autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic cellular clearance and recycling process through the lysosome-mediated degradation of damaged organelles and protein aggregates to maintain homeostasis. Impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Therefore, activating TFEB and autophagy provides a novel strategy for AD treatment. We previously described that clomiphene citrate (CC) promotes nuclear translocation of TFEB and increases autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. In this study, 7- and 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice were treated with TFEB agonist CC and assessed. The behavioral tests were performed using Morris water maze and open field test. Additional changes in amyloid-β pathology, autophagy, and inflammatory response were determined. We found that CC activated TFEB and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in neuronal cells. Moreover, using mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, CC treatment promoted clearance of amyloid-β plaques and ameliorated cognitive function in both 7- and 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice. The CC-induced activation of TFEB occurs by promoting acetylation of TFEB for nuclear translocation. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the TFEB-mediated activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway by CC, which has the potential to be repurposed and applied in the treatment or prevention of AD.

Abstract: In recent years of research on the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, capturing data relationships can help improve model performance. However, the simple graph structure can only capture pairwise relationships between data, which cannot model the complex data relationships in real situations. In addition, the redundant features and noise from the original data space also harm the model performance. Dual hypergraphs with feature-weighted and latent space learning (DHFWLSL) method for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis are proposed to solve the abovementioned problems. Hypergraphs are used to capture higher-order data relationships and construct hypergraphs for both sample and feature relationships to fully utilize the auxiliary ability of data relationships for model classification. In order to remove noise and redundant features from the original data space, latent space learning is utilized to project the original data into the latent space, and then data is projected into the label space for diagnosis. Finally, a feature-weighted strategy helps to improve the model performance further. An alternating optimization algorithm with the proof of convergence is used to solve the proposed model. Sufficient experiments support the validity and advantages of the proposed model.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system, which primarily affects elderly people and accounts for 70–80 % of dementia cases. The current prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that Alzheimer’s disease begins with the deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain. Major therapeutic strategies target Aβ production, aggregation, and clearance, although many clinical trials have shown that these therapeutic strategies are not sufficient to completely improve cognitive deficits in AD patients. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified that multiple important regulators are the most significant genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, especially in the innate immune pathways. These genetic risk factors suggest a critical role for microglia, highlighting their therapeutic potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss how these recently documented AD risk genes affect microglial function and AD pathology and how they can be further targeted to regulate microglial states and slow AD progression, especially the highly anticipated APOE and TREM2 targets. We focused on recent findings that modulation of innate and adaptive neuroimmune microenvironment crosstalk reverses cognitive deficits in AD patients. We also considered novel strategies for microglia in AD patients.

Abstract: As the population ages, cognitive disorder has emerged as a prevalent condition among the elderly, with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) being the most common type. This presents a significant social and economic challenge to the global public health system. While specific diagnostic methods for AD, such as cerebrospinal fluid testing or positron emission tomography, are available, their limited use in clinical practice is often attributed to their invasiveness or high cost. Recently, there has been growing interest in the potential of blood-based biomarkers for early screening, clinical diagnosis, and monitoring of treatment for AD. These biomarkers offer simplicity, low cost, and high patient compliance, and have shown promise in reflecting pathological changes in the brain. To standardize and guide the clinical application of blood-based biomarkers for AD, we have compiled a summary of recent advancements in clinical research and developed ten recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. These recommendations focus on the use of blood-based biomarkers for clinical diagnosis, early screening for AD, and predicting disease progression, thereby promoting their application in clinical settings.
