Abstract: Monoamine oxidase mainly includes two isoforms, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), of which MAO-B is a crucial metabolic enzyme, acts on dopamine and β-phenylethylamine and can be selectively inhibited by pargyline. MAO-B has emerged as a significant drug target for a variety of nervous system diseases. In the present work, a highly selective and sensitive fluorescent probe named 3-aminopropyl (3-oxo-3H-phenoxazin-7-yl) carbamate (AHPC) was designed and developed. AHPC showed good stability and cell membrane permeability in biological systems, and could detect endogenous MAO-B activity in real time, and accurately evaluate the changes of MAO-B under H2O2-induced oxidative stress. In addition, AHPC was able to detect the distribution of MAO-B in different organs. As MAO-B is an important drug target, we developed a high-throughput, visual screening system for MAO-B inhibitors based on AHPC. Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizome was screened from 272 kinds of Chinese medicine and displayed strong inhibitory effect toward MAO-B. After further separation of Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizome, it was found that Licoisoflavone B was the main active ingredient to inhibit MAO-B activity in different enzyme sources, and was expected to be a lead compound for the treatment of MAO-B-related diseases. In conclusion, with the advantages of fluorescent probe technology, we not only developed a handy molecular tool for real-time detection of MAO-B distribution and function in complex biosystems, but also established a high-throughput visualization method for screening MAO-B inhibitors from traditional Chinese medicine, which are promising for the treatment of many MAO-B-related diseases.

Abstract: Background
MAST2 (Microtubule-Associated Serine/Threonine Kinase 2) is an enigmatic serine/threonine kinase that is considered to bridge microtubule-associated cytoskeletal architecture through its phospho-regulatory networks. Yet, MAST2 remains a dark horse in the human kinome, as the molecular details on its structure, upstream regulators, and downstream phosphorylation targets remain unknown.
Methods and results
To interpret MAST2-linked phospho-signaling dynamics, PubMed-indexed articles were curated based on predefined MeSH terms to obtain global cellular phosphoproteomics datasets. Among 105 class I phosphosites in MAST2 identified across cellular phosphoproteomics datasets, 2 phosphosites, S74 and S148, were represented more abundantly compared to other phosphosites, making them predominant and functionally significant. Expression coregulation analysis, aimed at interpreting phosphosites that consistently show either similar or opposite patterns of expression, was performed by computing the expression patterns of phosphosites in parallel with the predominant MAST2 phosphosite. Their frequencies were then ranked across differential datasets to ensure consistency, and Fisher's exact test was performed to assess the likelihood of the coregulation pattern. Potential biases within the datasets were mitigated using additional cutoffs. Interpreting these datasets, we identified the majority of high-confidence coregulated protein phosphosites of both predominant phosphosites to be involved in transcriptional regulation. This is consistent with reports that a nearby Arg89Gln mutation in MAST2 disrupts its transcriptional regulatory activity. Co-occurrence analysis of phosphosites within MAST2 revealed that these predominant sites tend to co-occur positively and share similarity in expression coregulation patterns with phosphosites in other proteins. Finally, novel upstream kinases that potentially phosphorylate the predominant phosphosites of MAST2, as well as potential downstream substrates that are phosphorylated by MAST2, were also identified from the high-confidence coregulation dataset.
Conclusions
We propose that phosphorylations at S74 and S148 of MAST2 are functionally similar, and that these phosphosites are candidate regulatory sites influencing the transcriptional regulatory activity of MAST2.

Abstract: Background
The prevalence of electronic cigarette (e-cig) consumption has risen among adolescents and young adults, but its associations with systemic inflammation and brain structure remain unclear.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 215 participants categorized into four groups: individuals who use e-cigs exclusively (n = 48), those who exclusively use traditional cigarettes (n = 51), those who use both e-cigs and traditional cigarettes (n = 45), and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 71) group. Peripheral blood levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glial cell marker S100β, neuron-specific enolase, and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) were quantified. Gray matter volume (GMV) was assessed using voxel-based morphometry.
Results
Significant differences in GMV were observed in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), Heschl’s gyrus, thalamus, and cerebellum. Individuals who used e-cigs exclusively exhibited higher GMV in the right STG compared to those who used both e-cigs and traditional cigarettes but no significant difference relative to those who used traditional cigarettes exclusively. Peripheral levels of PSD-95, S100β, and hs-CRP also varied significantly across groups. Compared to HCs, individuals who used e-cigs had higher S100β, lower PSD-95, and lesser GMV in the right thalamus. Significant correlations were observed between these biomarkers and GMV in the right STG and thalamus. Additionally, PSD-95 levels were associated with nicotine dependence severity in those who used traditional cigarettes.
Conclusions
These findings suggest e-cig consumption is associated with differences in brain structure and peripheral inflammatory markers, highlighting a potential relationship between systemic inflammation and brain GMV.

Abstract: Background
Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), a well-known botanical drug in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for over 2000 years to treat cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders. In the context of rapidly expanding global markets for natural medicines, broad-spectrum efficacy of Salvia miltiorrhiza against cardiovascular diseases, fibrosis, diabetes, and viral infection positions it as a critical candidate for modern therapeutic development. Nevertheless, few studies are available reviewing the pharmacological properties and underlying mechanism of active ingredients in Salvia miltiorrhiza.
Purpose
This study aims to systematically review the pharmacological effects, underlying mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and toxicological profiles of Salvia miltiorrhiza and its active ingredients, and to evaluate its potential applications in modern medicine. Additionally, strategies to optimize its therapeutic efficacy and safety are proposed.
Methods
Data on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of Salvia miltiorrhiza were collected through scientific databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and CNKI. This review conducted relevant searches using the key words “Salvia miltiorrhiza”, “Danshen”, “biologically active ingredients in Salvia miltiorrhiza” and their combination with “pharmacological properties”, “pharmacokinetics”, “toxicology” and “clinical”, and included studies reported up to April 2025.
Results
The two major bioactive groups: lipophilic diterpenoid tanshinones (e.g., tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone) and hydrophilic phenolic acids (e.g., salvianolic acids A and B), endowing Salvia miltiorrhiza with a wide range of biological activities, including antifibrotic, antitumor, antidiabetic, cardiovascular protective, neuroprotective, anti-osteoporotic, and so on. However, its clinical application is limited due to its low oral bioavailability and possible adverse reactions such as liver and kidney damage. Fortunately, methods such as nanotechnology and drug delivery systems may significantly improve bioavailability and reduce adverse reactions.
Conclusion
This review synthesizes critical advances in understanding Salvia miltiorrhiza, affirming its multifaceted therapeutic potential through rigorous pharmacological evidence. In the future, addressing the bioavailability limitations of Salvia miltiorrhiza and elucidating its systemic mechanisms through an interdisciplinary approach will unlock its full potential, which will bridge the gap between traditional Chinese medicine and contemporary biomedical innovation, promoting the global application of Salvia miltiorrhiza.

Abstract: We propose a supervised ensemble learning-based approach to evaluate the significance of the digitised analogue clock drawing test (CDT) for the detection of neural impairments in patients with early-stage central nervous system disorders (CNSD). The research findings are based on the data samples that have been collected using the clock construction task of the Neural Impairment Test Suite (NITS) mobile application from 15 test subjects (including Huntington Disease (HD), Parkinson Disease (PD), cerebral palsy (CP), post-stroke, early dementia and control groups) during a pilot study in Lithuania. This work examines finger motion tracking (FMT) on a mobile device and the detection of potential inability of CNSD patients to accurately copy benchmark clock drawings without a pre-drawn clock contour circle, focusing on multimodal (datasets of FMT samples and CDT images) neural impairment screening. Considering the small size of the originally gathered imbalanced datasets, as pre-processing routines, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used for the FMT augmentation, and the geometric image transformations (rotation, flip, zoom) were applied for the augmentation of CDT drawings. The following methods for feature extraction are used regarding the FMT and CDT image datasets accordingly: 1) average finger speed while moving on the surface, finger velocity, magnitude of the rate at which finger tap changes its position, standard deviation (SD) of velocity, rate at which finger velocity changes, maximum finger acceleration, finger position change count, average finger screen pressure and touch area ratio (in range [0; 1]), total time duration (in seconds); 2) Edge Histogram Filter (EHD), Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradients (PHOG), Gabor wavelet and their fusion. Two experiments (E1, E2) were conducted to solve healthy vs. impaired binary classification problem. The nature of E1 design that is tracking motor impairments in CNSD and detecting cognitive impairments is targeted in E2. All classifiers (K-NN, Naïve Bayes, ANN, SMO, SVM and their ensembles) were tested with a 5-fold stratified cross-validation procedure, and the performances of classification models were evaluated by accuracy, balanced accuracy (BA), F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC-ROC), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used for the dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional image feature vectors. The overfitting of models was addressed by comparing the learning curves (training and validation sets). Results: 1) in E1, the highest 99.20 % accuracy precision (boosted SMO algorithm with PuK kernel) was achieved on SMOTE synthesised FMT train set and 99.40 % accuracy on FMT test set; 2) in E2 (augmented dataset of CDT images), the highest 97.96 % accuracy (94.90 % on test set) was achieved with ensemble of features (EHD, PHOG, Gabor) and KNN + AdaBoost (Naïve Bayes) + AdaBoost (SVM) majority vote classifier ensemble.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a worldwide prevalence of around 9.4 million that is expected to double by 2040. It's extended prodromal phase allows irreversible neuronal loss to occur before manifestation of symptoms. Current diagnostic approaches, primarily based on clinical assessment and neuroimaging, are often delayed and lack sensitivity in the early stages, highlighting the need for an early, conclusive, and minimally invasive test. This review focuses on the integration of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) diagnostics with aptamers to detect PD-associated biomarkers. CRISPR systems utilising Cas12 and Cas13 enzymes offer high specificity and collateral cleavage activity that can be harnessed for signal amplification. Aptamers are short, single-stranded oligonucleotides that can be designed to identify nucleic and non-nucleic acid targets. Their fusion with CRISPR may enable the sensitive detection of key PD biomarkers such as α-Syn, dopa decarboxylase, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and neurofilament light chain in biological fluids like blood, CSF, urine, saliva, and sweat. We explore various strategies for aptamer-CRISPR integration, detection, and multiplexing techniques for parallel biomarker detection. We also examine existing diagnostic platforms and discuss barriers to clinical translation. Ultimately, aptamer-CRISPR diagnostics could represent a powerful, next-generation approach for early PD detection.

Abstract: Aquaculture of Tasmanian Atlantic salmon occurs in a geographical area where water temperatures occasionally approach the upper thermal tolerance of the species and where climate change effects are ahead of global trends. This represents a concern for the local producers as well as being of global interest, particularly in the context of evolving aquaculture practices. In this study, we investigated the impact of long-term suboptimum conditions on seawater production characteristics of both small (Experiment 1; ∼420 g average size) and large (Experiment 2; ∼2600 g) Atlantic salmon from the same breeding cohort and genetic lines (∼170 families). Each experiment was undertaken in recirculating aquaculture systems and consisted of three periods: 14 days of acclimation (15 °C and 100 % dissolved oxygen -DO-); 67–72 days of exposure to suboptimum conditions (19 °C and 80 % DO); and a 40–42 day recovery period (15 °C and 100 % DO). All fish were PIT-tagged and individually measured at the pre-acclimation, post-suboptimum conditions, and post-recovery at the end of the experiment. Feed intake decreased during exposure to suboptimum conditions in both fish sizes but recovered during the recovery period. There were significant differences in specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and condition factor due to experimental conditions and fish size. Machine learning analyses identified a significantly greater impact of long-term exposure to suboptimum conditions on large fish as compared to small individuals. The translational approach used in this study improves our understanding of the effects of suboptimum summer conditions on Atlantic salmon and provides insights on practical size-based mitigation strategies and a baseline to produce predictive models.

Abstract: This article examines regulated data access (RDA) in the metaverse—an interconnected and immersive digital ecosystem comprising virtual, augmented, and hyper-physical realities. We organise the argument across taxonomy (Section 2), Digital Services Act (DSA)-anchored doctrine (Section 3), implementation challenges (Section 4), platform practices (Section 5), and a global blueprint (Section 6). Building on the European Union’s DSA, particularly Article 40, the analysis evaluates whether metaverse platforms qualify as Very Large Online Platforms or Very Large Online Search Engines and thus fall within the DSA’s data access rules. Drawing comparative insights from the UK’s Online Safety Act and the United States’ proposed Platform Accountability and Transparency Act, the article highlights differing global approaches to data sharing and the significant governance gaps that persist. This article categorizes metaverse-native data, including spatial, biometric, and eye-tracking data, into personal and non-personal types, stressing the heightened complexity of governing immersive, multidimensional information flows. While existing legal frameworks offer a starting point, the metaverse’s novel data practices demand targeted adaptations to address challenges like decentralised governance, user consent in real-time environments, and the integration of privacy-enhancing technologies. Through an examination of data access regimes across selected metaverse platforms, the article identifies a lack of uniform, transparent processes for external researchers. In this context, the article highlights RDA's broader public-interest function, facilitating external scrutiny of platform activities and ensuring service providers are held accountable. The absence of consistent RDA frameworks obstructs systemic risk research, undermining both risk assessment and mitigation efforts while leaving user rights vulnerable to opaque platform governance. To address these gaps, the article advances a set of policy recommendations aimed at strengthening RDA in the metaverse—adapting regulatory strategies to its evolving, decentralised architecture. By tailoring regulatory strategies to the metaverse’s dynamic nature, policymakers can foster accountability, innovation, and trust—both domestically (in jurisdictions like the UK, where data access provisions remain underdeveloped) and internationally. The analysis extends beyond mere applications to metaverse platforms, providing insights that can be applied to the online platform ecosystem in its entirety. Ultimately, this article charts a path toward harmonized, future-ready data governance frameworks—one that integrates RDA as a core regulatory mechanism for ‘augmented accountability’, essential for safeguarding user rights and enabling independent risk assessment in the metaverse.

Abstract: Background
Critical illness and its management in the intensive care unit (ICU) place a significant burden on patients, leading to symptoms such as pain, sleep disorders, fatigue, dyspnea, thirst, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Virtual reality has emerged as a promising intervention for symptom management across various patient populations. However, the effects of virtual reality-based interventions on symptom management among adult ICU patients are unclear.
Aim
This review aims to critically synthesize evidence evaluating the effects of virtual reality-based interventions on symptoms in adult ICU patients.
Methods
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CNKI, Wanfang Data, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) from inception to 5 June 2025 was performed. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. The effect of the intervention was estimated as the standard mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) using random-effects models in Review Manager 5.4, with heterogeneity assessed by the I2 statistic. Narrative syntheses were adopted when meta-analysis was inappropriate. The overall certainty of the evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023487828).
Results
Out of 6517 identified records, 9 studies were eligible, and 8 were included in the meta-analysis. Virtual reality-based interventions significantly reduced anxiety levels (k = 6, SMD = −0.50, 95 % CI [−0.94, −0.06], P = 0.02, I2 = 86 %, low certainty of evidence) and improve sleep quality in ICU patients (k = 4, SMD = 0.91, 95 % CI [0.62, 1.20], P < 0.00001, I2 = 32 %, low certainty of evidence). Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested a difference based on intervention frequency (P for subgroup difference = 0.04). Sensitivity analysis showed unstable results for anxiety but stable for sleep quality. Narrative analyses indicated that virtual reality-based interventions may reduce depression and short-term mental health-related quality of life but did not show significant effects on fatigue, thirst, dyspnea, post-traumatic stress disorder, or physical health-related quality of life. Effects on pain and overall discomfort were inconsistent. No severe adverse events were reported.
Conclusions
Preliminary evidence suggests that virtual reality-based interventions may alleviate anxiety, improve sleep quality, reduce depression, and enhance short-term mental health-related quality of life in adult ICU patients. Manageable safety concerns support their feasibility. Additional rigorous trials are needed to further confirm these findings.

Abstract: Stress during prenatal period can affect the young ones, increasing the risk of aberrations in gut-brain of neonates during critical developmental periods and serves as a risk factor for postnatal pathologies. Compelling data from animal studies has shown that gestational stress-induced hyperactivation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by excessive corticosterone (CORT) release, underlies profound and lasting developmental deficits in the offspring. It is well-established that stress during the gestational period disrupts gut and brain homeostasis in the F1 generation of Wistar rats. However, morin (3, 5, 7, 2′, 4′-pentahydroxyflavone), a plant flavonoid, exerts neuroprotective and antioxidant potential which could be beneficial in management of prenatal stress (PNS). Hence, this study was designed to evaluate the mitigatory potential of morin against the detrimental effects of prenatal stress, including the early onset of apoptosis in the gut and brain of the F1 offspring. Morin treatment to the stressed dams significantly improved HPA axis mediated oxidative stress and gut & brain barrier permeabilities. Furthermore, morin, due to its redox balancing and anti-inflammatory properties, prevented early onset of apoptosis, maintained the histoarchitecture and functions of gut & brain in F1 progeny. These findings provide a favourable research basis that morin administration during gestational period can significantly help in regulation of stress induced transgenerational gut-brain axis pathologies.

Abstract: Background:
The use of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors for gait analysis has become more prevalent. More options are being offered under the development of wearable smart devices and smartphones. These techniques provide a cost-effective way to collect motion data from everyday activities, addressing the limitations of controlled laboratory environments. Despite the potential of these technologies, there are still many challenges in analyzing gait data from everyday life.
Method:
Experiments involved 16 participants (7 women, 9 men; mean age: 27.69 years) who performed walking, jogging, and going up and down stairs under three smartphone-carrying conditions: pocket, backpack, and shoulder bag. Data were collected using iPhone 14, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods Pro, supplemented with Xsens motion capture for ground truth. IMU data from accelerometers and gyroscopes were preprocessed and standardized before applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A novel sliding window-based algorithm was developed for gait segmentation and grouping, featuring a Continuity-Matching Score (CMS) for evaluating both continuity and match quality.
Result:
The proposed algorithm achieved an overall segmentation accuracy of 89.25%, with the highest performance (90.38%) observed when the smartphone was carried in a pocket. Rand Index values confirmed reliable gait grouping, with minor accuracy reductions under more dynamic carrying conditions, such as backpacks. For walk-only dataset, segmentation accuracy improved to 95.67%, while for run-only dataset, the accuracy reached 96.21%.
Conclusion:
This study introduced a system for daily-life gait analysis using consumer-grade IMU-equipped devices. The algorithm is capable of handling data containing multiple gait types, achieving reliable segmentation and grouping of synchronous gaits. Future work will focus on enhancing algorithm adaptability to dynamic environments and expanding its applicability to larger and more diverse datasets.

Abstract: Introduction
Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism with multi-systemic manifestations. Despite available treatment, patients often experience functional impairment. However, the relationship between clinical phenotype, mental status, and disability remains underexplored.
Objective
To investigate the associations between disease severity, cognitive performance, depressive symptoms, and functional disability in adults with WD using validated instruments.
Methods
In this prospective, single-center cross-sectional study (2021–2023), 32 clinically stable WD patients followed at a tertiary neurology clinic were assessed with the WHODAS 2.0, GAS-WD, Mini-MoCA, and PHQ-9. Functional outcomes were evaluated using WHODAS 2.0 domains. Associations between clinical variables and scale scores were analyzed using non-parametric tests. Ethical approval (ref: 183-DEFI/165-CE) and informed consent were obtained.
Results
Participants had a mean age of 39.8±13.6 years; 56.3% were female. Median diagnostic delay was 1 year. Most had hepatic (56.3%) or neurological phenotype (37.5%). The WHODAS 2.0 participation domain was the most impaired (median=4.0, IQR 2–9). WHODAS scores correlated positively with GAS-WD scores (rs=0.77, p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (rs=0.65, p<0.001), and negatively with Mini-MoCA. No significant associations were found between diagnostic delay and disability. Stratified analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in participation across genders (p=0.83) or clinical subtypes (p=0.47).
Conclusion
Functional disability in WD is significantly associated with disease severity, cognitive deficits, and depressive symptoms, but not with gender or clinical subtype. WHODAS 2.0 is a feasible tool for comprehensive functional assessment in WD. Multidisciplinary approaches addressing mental and cognitive health are essential.
Resumen
Introducción
La enfermedad de Wilson (EW) es un trastorno genético poco frecuente del metabolismo del cobre con manifestaciones multisistémicas. A pesar de los tratamientos disponibles, los pacientes a menudo presentan discapacidad funcional. Sin embargo, la relación entre el fenotipo clínico, el estado mental y la discapacidad sigue siendo poco explorada.
Objetivo
Investigar las asociaciones entre la gravedad de la enfermedad, el rendimiento cognitivo, los síntomas depresivos y la discapacidad funcional en adultos con EW utilizando instrumentos validados.
Métodos
En este estudio transversal, prospectivo y unicéntrico (2021-2023), se evaluaron 32 pacientes con EW clínicamente estables, seguidos en una consulta neurológica de nivel terciario, mediante las escalas WHODAS 2.0, GAS-WD, Mini-MoCA y PHQ-9. Los resultados funcionales se analizaron a través de los dominios del WHODAS 2.0. Las asociaciones entre variables clínicas y puntuaciones en las escalas se analizaron utilizando pruebas no paramétricas. Se obtuvo aprobación ética (ref.: 183-DEFI/165-CE) y consentimiento informado.
Resultados
La edad media de los participantes fue de 39,8±13,6 años; el 56,3% eran mujeres. La mediana del retraso diagnóstico fue de un año. La mayoría presentaba un fenotipo hepático (56,3%) o neurológico (37,5%). El dominio de participación del WHODAS 2.0 fue el más afectado (mediana=4,0; rango intercuartílico 2-9). Las puntuaciones del WHODAS se correlacionaron positivamente con las del GAS-WD (rs=0,77; p <0,001) y el PHQ-9 (rs=0,65; p <0,001), y negativamente con el Mini-MoCA. No se encontraron asociaciones significativas entre el retraso diagnóstico y la discapacidad. El análisis estratificado no mostró diferencias estadísticamente significativas en el dominio de participación según el sexo (p=0,83) ni el subtipo clínico (p=0,47).
Conclusión
La discapacidad funcional en la EW se asocia significativamente con la gravedad de la enfermedad, los déficits cognitivos y los síntomas depresivos, pero no con el sexo ni con el subtipo clínico. El WHODAS 2.0 es una herramienta viable para la evaluación funcional integral en la EW. Se requiere un enfoque multidisciplinario que aborde tanto la salud mental como la cognitiva.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Molecular chaperones maintain proteostasis by assisting protein folding, stability, and activity. Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Hsp90 are ATP-dependent chaperones essential for protein quality control, signaling, and stress adaptation. Their activities are controlled not only by co-chaperones but also by dynamic post-translational modifications (PTMs). The review dissects phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, and other PTMs of Hsp70 and Hsp90 across systems. These PTMs regulate the ATPase activity, localization, and interactions of the molecular chaperones with major implications in health and disease. The term ‘chaperone code’ describes the PTMs landscape that fine tunes the chaperone function. This code governs client fate, drug sensitivity, and stress responses. Importantly, combinatorial PTMs introduce regulatory complexity and flexibility, especially in cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. The crosstalk between various PTMs and feedback loops add new regulatory layers to chaperone function. Additionally, these PTMs impact the function of the clients that are central in regulating a specific cellular processes or pathways such as transcription, autophagy, metabolism, and immune regulation. These pathways are usually affected in different maladies such cancer, neurodegenerative, infectious and chronic diseases. Unlocking the chaperone code is essential for directing chaperone activity toward therapeutic benefit. This can be achieved by targeting enzymes that write, erase, or read the chaperone code therefore offering new therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Introduction
This preregistered (PROSPERO ID: 272529) systematic review analyzed the reliability, validity, acceptability, and feasibility of methods to screen and identify primary care patients at increased risk for dementia.
Methods
Inclusion criteria were studies of dementia risk screening methods applied, or designed for use, in primary care, or derived or validated with primary care data for use with community-dwelling adults (≥18 years) without dementia/cognitive impairment. Articles were limited to full text peer-reviewed studies published in English. Searches were conducted from database inception until 09.21.21/09.22.21 (updated 09.04.22, 09.16.24) in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and COCHRANE with backwards snowballing. Risk Of Bias (ROB) was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomized studies, the Cochrane ROB tool for randomized trials-V2, and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program qualitative checklist.
Results
Eleven validated tools and scores were investigated in 34 studies. Participant numbers ranged from 100-94,000,000. Tools and scores were used or validated in one (six tools) to 13 studies (one tool). Most studies were from higher-income countries. ROB was low in most studies. C-statistics were most commonly used (range = .52-.86). Tools and scores generally had acceptable prediction but performed poorly in samples differing from the derivation sample. The CAIDE and LIBRA demonstrated acceptable validity in midlife samples, and the LIBRA in older samples <80 years of age.
Discussion
The CAIDE and LIBRA are recommended for midlife and older adults <80 years, but further research is needed for adults ≥80 and lower-middle income countries.

Abstract: Isothiazolinones (ITs) are biocides with various biological properties and are hence used across different industries. They are commonly found in consumer products, disinfectants, and household cleaners. Although effective, ITs have been reported to exhibit neurotoxic effects in mouse- and rat-derived cells. However, the neurotoxicity of ITs in humans remains underexplored. In this study, we compared the neurotoxicity of four commonly used ITs—1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (BIT), 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT), 2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (OIT), and 4,5-dichloro-2-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (DCOIT)—in human-derived neuronal cells. The viability of cells exposed to these ITs decreased the most with MIT, followed by BIT, OIT, and DCOIT, respectively. The ITs induced changes in neurite growth and the expression of neurodevelopmental genes at concentrations considered noncytotoxic. RNA-sequencing revealed the regulation of the expression of genes associated with neurodevelopmental processes; ANXA2 and SYTL5 were upregulated following treatment with all four ITs, indicating their potential as biomarkers for IT-induced neurotoxicity. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated an association between all the tested ITs and neurodegenerative diseases. BIT caused the most pronounced changes in neurodevelopmental gene expression, with the highest potential for neurotoxicity. These findings provide insights into the potential neurotoxicity of ITs and highlight the need for revised safety assessments and regulatory strategies to address the risks associated with human exposure.

Abstract: Background
The association between opioid use disorder (OUD) and cerebral aneurysm rupture has been suggested in recent studies. However, these studies are limited to small sample sizes and lack data on medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). We investigate the association between OUD and cerebral aneurysm rupture in a large database.
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was conducted using de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data from Oracle EHR Real-World Data™ (OERWD). Cox proportional hazard regressions were conducted to assess the association between OUD and aneurysm rupture, and the association of MOUD with aneurysm rupture, over different years of follow-up.
Results
Patients with OUD (n = 584,125), compared to non-exposures (n = 1752,375) had 54 % higher risk (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) [95 % confidence interval (CI)]: 1.54 [1.34, 1.76]) of cerebral aneurysm rupture within one year of follow-up and 28 % higher risk (aHR [95 % CI]: 1.28 [1.14, 1.44]) within five years of follow-up. Additionally, patients with OUD and MOUD treatment (n = 83,164), compared to those with OUD but without MOUD (n = 410,466), had 25 % lower risk (aHR [95 % CI]: 0.75 [0.55, 1.01]) of cerebral aneurysm rupture in one year of follow-up and 30 % lower risk (aHR [95 % CI]: 0.70 [0.51, 0.98]) in five years of follow-up.
Conclusions
This research identified OUD as a significant risk factor, and MOUD as a protective factor both significant and on the boundary of significance in certain years of follow-up for cerebral aneurysm rupture. These results provide important insight that could encourage future targeted strategies for early intervention and prevention in such patients.

Abstract: Purpose
: To compare the 2-year longitudinal changes in macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness (GCIPLT) and superficial capillary plexus (SCP) vessel density between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without retinopathy (non-DR) and healthy controls.
Design
: Prospective observational cohort study.
Methods
: T2DM patients without clinical retinopathy at baseline and after a 2-year follow-up, along with age- and sex-matched healthy controls, were recruited from the community in Guangzhou. Measurements of macular GCIPLT, retinal thickness (RT), and SCP vessel density were conducted at baseline and at the 2-year follow-up. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate absolute and relative rates of changes and to compare absolute rates between the two groups.
Results
: A total of 282 eyes (141 in the control group and 141 in the non-DR group) were included in the analysis. Significant reductions in GCIPT and GCIPLT/RT occurred only in the non-DR group, with GCIPLT decreasing by -0.229 μm/year (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.313 to -0.144; P < 0.001) and 0.324 % (95%CI: 0.444 to 0.204; P < 0.001), approximately 5-fold faster than the control group. After adjusting for confounding factors, the longitudinal rates of RT, GCIPLT, and GCIPLT/RT were significantly accelerated in the non-DR group compared to the control group by -0.603 μm/year (95% CI: -0.939 to -0.268; P < 0.001), -0.189 μm/year (95% CI: -0.306 to -0.073; P = 0.001), and -0.073 % (95% CI: -0.118 to -0.028; P = 0.001), respectively. While, longitudinal changes in SCP vessel density did not show significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.861).
Conclusions
: Our findings suggest that neurodegenerative changes may precede microvascular alterations in non-DR patients, indicating that monitoring of GCIPLT is crucial for patients with long-standing diabetes, even in the absence of retinopathy.

Abstract: Background
Lower opioid prescribing continuity is associated with a higher risk of opioid-related adverse events. This study aimed to evaluate the association between opioid prescribing continuity and risk of opioid use disorder (OUD).
Methods
Older adults (≥ 65 years) on long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) were identified from 2012 to 2020 5 % Medicare claims data. The study outcome was OUD. Opioid prescribing continuity, measured using the continuity of care index (COCI), was treated as a time-varying predictor measured monthly from LTOT initiation until outcome/censoring. The association between COCI and risk of OUD was evaluated using an extended Cox regression model.
Results
Of 153,570 patients, 7.61 % (n = 11,697) developed OUD after LTOT initiation. The mean (SD) age was 75.74 (8.42) years and 70.16 % (n = 107,743) were female. After adjusting for covariates, patients with medium COCI (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.76, 95 % CI 1.58 – 1.96; p < .001) and high COCI (aHR = 1.32, 95 % CI 1.22 – 1.44; p < .001) had higher OUD risk compared to those with low COCI. Patients with high COCI (aHR = 0.75, 95 % CI 0.69 – 0.82; p < .001) had significantly lower hazard of OUD than those with medium COCI.
Conclusion
Greater opioid prescribing continuity may promote OUD detection, highlighting the importance of consistent care for better management of opioid-related conditions. Alternatively, highly fragmented care among patients with LTOT may lead to lower detection of OUD, despite patients potentially being at higher risk for OUD. Thus, it is important to build trustful patient-prescriber relationships for early OUD detection and management.

Abstract: Parabens are extensively used preservatives with endocrine disrupting effects and neurotoxicity. Their restricted usage may drive the development of alternatives for producing preservative-free products. Nevertheless, the prevalence and health risks of paraben analogues remain poorly understood. Herein, we screened potential paraben analogues using high-resolution mass spectrometry and assessed their prevalence in personal care products (PCPs) and population exposure trends. We first identified p-hydroxyacetophenone (PhAc), a structural analogue of parabens, in children’s urine based on the common fragmentation characteristics of parabens. Quantitative analysis revealed that the average content of PhAc in PCPs was 2–38 times higher than that of typical parabens. Furthermore, the longitudinal biomonitoring study conducted from 2016 to 2023 revealed that the geometric mean levels of PhAc in the urine of children aged 5–13 years in South China increase from 35.20 μg/L to 102.68 μg/L, which is 1–3 orders of magnitude greater than parabens. Nevertheless, PhAc is not a permitted preservative in PCPs and its health risk is unclear. To investigate the potential neurotoxicity of extensively present PhAc, neuronal cells were exposed to different concentrations of PhAc and typical parabens for 24 h, respectively. The results indicated that PhAc exhibited greater potential neurotoxicity than methylparaben, the most widely used paraben. Even exposure to doses comparable to urinary PhAc concentrations (100 nM-1 μM) could significantly disrupt metabolism homeostasis, damage cell membranes and morphology, and increase apoptosis rate in neuronal cells. Therefore, PhAc, a new paraben analogue with wider product applications, higher human exposure, and greater potential neurotoxicity, may pose considerable ecological and human health risks.

Abstract: Thrombus-induced ischemic stroke (IS) remains a serious threat a serious health threat with limited therapeutic efficacy due to the dual challenges of precise thrombus targeting and restricted blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. While conventional nanocarriers, such as liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), demonstrate clinical potential due to their mature preparation protocols, their application is limited by poor targeting accuracy, inadequate biocompatibility, and rapid systemic clearance. In response, microenvironment-responsive biomimetic drug delivery systems based on cell membrane-camouflaged nanomedicines (CM-NMs) have emerged as a promising strategy, leveraging the pathological features of ischemic lesions for enhanced targeting and treatment. CM-NMs stand out by utilizing cell membranes to preserve innate targeting and/or BBB penetration capabilities. This approach also ensures high biocompatibility and minimizes the risk of immune clearance. This review highlights recent advances in CM-NMs for IS treatment, critically discussing three key approaches: (1) platelet membrane-camouflaged nanomedicines (PLM-NMs), which mimic platelet adhesion for thrombus-specific accumulation, (2) immune cell membrane NMs and stem cell membrane NMs, which leverage inflammatory tropism or homing mechanisms for enhanced BBB penetration, and (3) hybrid membrane NMs, which enable multi-targeting capabilities. Furthermore, we discuss ongoing challenges and clinical translation potential of CM-NMs to provide guidance for next-generation CM-NMs.

Abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that impairs both motor and cognitive functions. Accurate detection of PD remains a major challenge, particularly at early stages when clinical symptoms are subtle. This study presents the first multimodal machine learning framework integrating functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data for early-stage PD detection during dual-task mobility assessments. Data were collected from 62 participants, including 28 people with PD and 34 age-matched controls, who performed the clinically recommended Timed Up and Go (TUG), Cognitive Dual-Task TUG (CDTUG), and Motor Dual-Task TUG (MDTUG) tests. This complex multimodal experimental design simultaneously captured brain activation and body motion under motor and cognitive dual-task conditions. Four machine learning models combined with two feature selection techniques were applied to unimodal and multimodal datasets. The multimodal approach achieved superior classification accuracy (96%) compared to fNIRS-only (87%) and IMU-only (95%) models. Key brain–body biomarkers were identified, including dorsolateral prefrontal and frontopolar cortex activations during dual tasks, alongside motor features such as turn, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit durations. These findings highlight the promise of combining brain and motion measures and complex functional mobility tests for early-stage PD detection and advance the development of non-invasive, AI-driven biomarker discovery frameworks.

Abstract: We examine the impact of the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) September 2022 regulation on market quality that allowed Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to participate in selected commodity futures contracts. We analyze all active commodity futures contracts traded at the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), the leading commodity derivatives exchange in India. In this natural experiment, we implement a difference-in-differences approach and find that post-regulation liquidity in commodity futures increases significantly, with no adverse impact on volatility. The results are robust after controlling for lagged volume, contract value, time to maturity, and spot volatility. Furthermore, several placebo tests confirm the robustness of our findings.

Abstract: Background
Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by chondrocyte senescence and oxidative stress, affects over 300 million people globally. Kisspeptin-54, a neuropeptide with pleiotropic protective effects, was investigated for its role in chondrocyte senescence and its underlying mechanisms.
Methods
Oxidative stress and senescence were induced in primary mouse chondrocytes by treating them with TBHP. Kisspeptin-54 was administered at varying concentrations (10–1000 nM) to assess cytoprotection, while SIRT3 was knocked down using adenoviral shRNA to validate mechanistic pathways. Telomere length, mTERT expression, telomerase activity, and p53 acetylation were evaluated via Southern blot, RT-PCR, and western blot techniques. Furthermore, senescence was evaluated through the application of SA-β-galactosidase staining alongside the measurement of PAI-1 expression.
Results
TBHP induced dose-dependent GPR54 downregulation, oxidative stress (260 % increase in ROS), telomere attrition (41 % reduction in length), and senescence (270 % increase in SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells). Kisspeptin-54 (≤200 nM) rescued cell viability, reduced LDH release (57 % at 200 nM), and mitigated ROS and SOD activity decline. Mechanistically, Kisspeptin-54 restored SIRT3 expression, suppressed p53 acetylation (Acetyl-p53[K382] reduced by 56 % at 200 nM), and preserved telomere function (telomere length restored to 91 % of control). SIRT3 knockdown abrogated these effects, confirming its critical role.
Conclusion
Kisspeptin-54 alleviates chondrocyte senescence via a dual mechanism: (1) SIRT3-mediated restoration of mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and telomere homeostasis; (2) inhibition of p53 hyperacetylation and downstream senescence signaling. These findings establish Kisspeptin-54 as an innovative therapeutic candidate for OA acting through the modulation of the SIRT3/p53 axis to combat oxidative stress and telomere dysfunction.

Abstract: Excitation–inhibition balance is a fundamental property of cortical circuits, reflecting homeostatic plasticity that stabilizes neural activity in the face of functional disruption. This framework has been widely implicated in sensory deprivation and psychiatric disorders. In the auditory domain, it remains unclear how long-term bilateral and unilateral hearing loss reorganizes cortical E-I balance and how such reorganization affects speech processing. Here, we recorded resting-state EEG and measured spectral exponents as a noninvasive proxy for cortical E-I balance in individuals with bilateral hearing loss, single-sided deafness, and normal hearing. We found that spectral exponents differed systematically across hearing loss types. Participants with bilateral hearing loss exhibited reduced exponents, primarily in central-parietal regions, relative to normal-hearing controls, with a gradual increase with prolonged hearing-loss duration. In contrast, left- and right-sided deafness showed distinct patterns of hemispheric lateralization in spectral exponents. Participants also performed a naturalistic speech listening task, allowing quantification of neural tracking of speech. It showed stronger envelope tracking response for bilateral hearing loss group than normal control. Importantly, resting-state exponents across all hearing-impaired groups robustly predicted the strength of speech envelope tracking in noisy environments. These findings reveal dissociable patterns of aperiodic cortical dynamics following bilateral and unilateral auditory deprivation and highlight the homeostatic plasticity in supporting speech perception under challenging listening conditions.

Abstract: Abstract:
Objective
Hot flashes significantly affect quality of life in cancer patients undergoing hormone deprivation therapy and postmenopausal women. Pharmaceutical interventions often carry substantial risks. This study evaluated whether a wrist cooling device could serve as a safe, non-pharmaceutical intervention for reducing hot flash severity.
Methods
We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, randomized crossover trial in 27 participants (10 breast cancer, 12 prostate cancer, 5 postmenopausal women) experiencing at least two moderate-to-severe daily hot flashes. Participants were randomized to receive either the active KÜLKUF wrist cooling device (cooling to 47°F) or an identical sham device (fan only). After two weeks of baseline recording, participants used their assigned device for two weeks, then crossed over to the alternative device for two additional weeks. Hot flash frequency and severity were recorded in standardized diaries throughout all phases.
Results
Compared to baseline, the active cooling intervention reduced severe hot flash episodes by 46% (95% CI: 18-74%, p<0.02) and total daily hot flashes by 18%. Subgroup analysis revealed consistent effects across all populations: 41% reduction in breast cancer patients, 50% in both postmenopausal women and prostate cancer patients. Univariate analysis confirmed significant reduction in hot flash severity (p<0.01) after adjusting for age and underlying condition. No adverse events were reported, and the study achieved perfect retention with no dropouts.
Conclusion
These preliminary findings suggest that targeted wrist cooling may offer a safe approach for managing vasomotor symptoms, though larger studies are needed to confirm efficacy. Larger studies are needed to confirm efficacy and support clinical implementation.

Abstract: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) plays a critical role in cellular responses to oxygen deprivation and is increasingly recognized as a key regulator in neurodegenerative diseases. Drosophila melanogaster serves as a powerful genetic model for investigating HIF-1α signaling, particularly through its homolog Sima. This review examines the advantages and limitations of using Drosophila to study HIF-1α in the context of neurodegeneration, with a focus on oxidative stress, autophagy, and mitochondrial dysfunction. We discuss the role of HIF-1α/Sima in modulating neuroprotective pathways, including its interactions with DJ-1 (also known as PARK7 Parkinson disease protein 7), SNCA (Alpha-synuclein), and the mTOR-autophagy axis. Moreover, we highlight the potential of Drosophila in elucidating hypoxia-mediated epigenetic modifications, non-coding RNA regulation, and metabolic adaptations relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding these mechanisms may provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches for the major neurodegenerative conditions in humans, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

Abstract: Exposure to lead (Pb) poses significant risks to human brain development. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying Pb acetate-induced neurotoxicity in LUHMES cells, which represent a human fetal-derived dopaminergic neuronal precursor model particularly suited for studies of neurotoxicity and Parkinson’s disease. Morphological analyses revealed that Pb acetate exposure at concentrations exceeding 10µM induced cytotoxicity and disrupted neurite outgrowth. Distinct gene expression changes associated with Pb exposure were determined through RNA-sequencing. Principal component analysis highlighted significant alterations in gene expression at higher Pb concentrations (10µM) compared with lower Pb concentrations (1µM) and controls. Notably, Pb acetate exposure impaired ribosomal function, Spliceosome and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways. Furthermore, these three pathways related that Pb acetate exposure resulted in the upregulation of genes related to ER-associated degradation and apoptosis, whereas the ubiquitin ligase complex was disrupted, suggesting compromised protein homeostasis. These findings underscore the potential of ribosomal processes and ER stress pathways as biomarkers of Pb acetate exposure. This study provides advanced mechanistic insights into the toxicological effects of lead (Pb) as a heavy metal, with a specific emphasis on its influence on cellular processes related to proteostasis and stress response pathways. Our findings further highlight the importance of LUHMES cells as a human-derived neuronal model for elucidating neurodevelopmental toxicity and identifying molecular biomarkers of Pb exposure, particularly those associated with dysregulation in ribosomal function and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling.

Abstract: Purpose
To investigate how 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) coordinates competing post-translational modifications of TrkB, specifically examining its role in modulating the redox-sensitive balance between tyrosine nitration and phosphorylation to achieve neuroprotective efficacy.
Methods
The effects of 7,8-DHF on nitric oxide (NO) inhibition, protein nitration, TrkB activation, and downstream signaling were assessed using a male mouse optic nerve crush (ONC) model and 3D retinal explants. Techniques such as Western blotting, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry, metabolomics, and molecular docking were used to examine the biochemical and molecular impacts of 7,8-DHF.
Results
7,8-DHF reduced NO levels and inducible/neuronal nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/nNOS) expression in 3D retinal cultures and ONC mouse models, with molecular docking indicating its binding to iNOS's active site and metabolomics showing downregulation of the arginine biosynthesis pathway. It also decreased TrkB nitration in vivo and in vitro, with the Y816 residue being critical for this modification. 7,8-DHF enhanced TrkB phosphorylation at Y816 and PLCγ1 activation, inhibited by L-arginine and TrkB blockers. Additionally, 7,8-DHF promoted retinal gangion cell survival and axonal regeneration via TrkB signaling, effects reversed by nitration agents or TrkB blockers.
Conclusion
7,8-DHF pioneers a new class of nitration-phosphorylation modulators, converting nitrosative damage into neuroregenerative signals by rebalancing TrkB's modification states. This mechanistic insight opens therapeutic avenues for optic nerve disorders.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative condition marked by progressive motor and non-motor symptoms. P450 enzymes, notably those from the CYP1 and CYP2 families, are increasingly recognised as significant factors in the development of PD. This review examines the role of P450 enzymes in PD, covering genetic variations, copy number variations (CNVs), and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to PD pathogenicity. It also explores the regulatory mechanisms controlling P450 expression in PD and the influence of the gut microbiome and metabolites on P450 activity. Additionally, the review discusses how P450 enzymes metabolically activate drugs used to treat PD and investigates the intricate relationship between P450s and mitochondrial dysfunction. Finally, it underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting P450 enzymes for PD treatment. Understanding the diverse roles of P450 enzymes in PD may lead to innovative treatment approaches and personalised interventions for this challenging neurological disorder.

Abstract: Aims
This study aimed to investigate the association between sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Methods
We conducted a real-world cohort study using the TriNetX U.S. Research Network. Adults aged ≥ 50 years with T2D initiating SGLT2is, GLP-1RAs, or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) between 2015 and 2022 were included. A landmark analysis using a new-user, active-comparator design with propensity score matching was applied. The primary outcome was incident PD. A meta-analysis incorporating additional real-world studies was also performed.
Results
In total, 93,872, 110,366, and 95,838 patients were included in the SGLT2i vs. DPP4i, GLP-1RA vs. DPP4i, and SGLT2i vs. GLP-1RA comparisons, respectively. SGLT2i users had a significantly lower risk of PD compared with both DPP4i users (HR = 0.80, 95 % CI: 0.69–0.93, p = 0.003) and GLP-1RA users (HR = 0.80, 95 % CI: 0.69–0.93, p = 0.003). No significant difference was observed between GLP-1RA and DPP4i users (HR = 0.97, 95 % CI: 0.85–1.10, p = 0.656). The meta-analysis further supported the reduced PD risk associated with SGLT2i use.
Conclusions
SGLT2i use was associated with a significantly lower risk of PD compared with both DPP4i and GLP-1RA use in patients with T2D.

Abstract: Summary
Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is crucial to develop effective interventions. Here we utilized induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into neurons (iPSC-N) from idiopathic ASD and control individuals (CTRL) to investigate the molecular basis of ASD. ASD-iPSC-N exhibited functional alterations displaying less calcium transients compared to CTRL. Different expression levels of microRNAs involved in neurogenesis and neuronal functioning might underlie these differences. ASD-iPSC-N neuronal networks showed impaired synaptic neurotransmission and connectivity (decreased [Ca2+]i waves and glutamatergic transmission), as demonstrated by a chemogenetic approach utilizing DREADD in co-cultures of iPSC-N and rat cortical neurons. Such functional alterations have profound implications for neuronal network formation and function, contributing to the core pathogenic features of ASD. Therefore, utilization of ASD-iPSC-N offers a unique opportunity to study the molecular mechanism in a relevant human cellular context. Our findings highlight the significance of neuronal activity and synaptic dysfunction in ASD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular diseases (such as ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, and vascular dementia) are characterized by high incidence and disability rates, posing significant challenges in clinical treatment. Paeoniflorin, a primary active compound derived from the traditional Chinese herb Paeonia lactiflora, exhibits a multi-targeting nature by acting through multiple molecular pathways in the treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. However, its mechanisms of action and efficacy have not yet been systematically reviewed. Therefore, we aimed to summarize the current research progress on paeoniflorin in the field of cerebrovascular diseases and elucidate its pharmacological actions and therapeutic mechanisms. Extensive studies have shown that paeoniflorin exerts neuroprotective effects by suppressing inflammatory responses, alleviating oxidative stress, improving microcirculation, and promoting neural repair and angiogenesis. Its remarkable clinical efficacy and unique mechanisms of action provide novel strategies for cerebrovascular disease treatment and establish a crucial theoretical foundation for developing new neuroprotective drugs, indicating its broad prospects for clinical application and research value. This review aims to summarize the evidence regarding the efficacy of paeoniflorin in treating cerebrovascular diseases, elucidate its multipath pharmacological activities, provide insights for clinical application and novel drug development, and identify potential challenges for future drug development.

Abstract: Background
Globally, the pathogenesis and progression of many human diseases are intimately associated with folate metabolism disorder. Emerging evidence from recent investigations has underscored the pivotal role of folate metabolism in cardiovascular homeostasis, particularly in the context of myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). Despite a wealth of pre-existing research, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain not fully elucidated.
Aim of review
To deeply explore the complex interrelationships among folate metabolism, myocardial hypertrophy, and heart failure, this review systematically elucidates the impact of the folate-homocysteine (Hcy) axis on myocardial hypertrophy and HF progression, integrating both experimental evidence and clinical observations. This review also investigates how genetic variations, and environmental factors modulate folate metabolism, and their mechanistic links to the development of myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Additionally, the review explores epigenetic modifications and their intricate crosstalk with the folate-homocysteine-heart disease axis, providing a comprehensive framework of the underlying pathophysiology. Finally, it proposes potential therapeutic strategies targeting the folate-homocysteine axis for myocardial hypertrophy and HF.
Key scientific concepts of review
Folate deficiency can lead to homocysteine accumulation, resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), which contributes to the development of myocardial hypertrophy and HF. Correcting the imbalance of the folate-homocysteine axis may interrupt this pathological cascade, positioning the folate-homocysteine axis as a potential target for the treatment of myocardial hypertrophy and HF.

Abstract: MepA efflux protein found in Staphylococcus aureus belongs to the MATE (Multidrug and Toxic Compound Extrusion) family and plays an important role in bacterial resistance. We investigated the potential of lauric acid as an inhibitor of the MepA efflux pump by means of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assays and modulation of the MICs of ciprofloxacin and ethidium bromide (EtBr) against S. aureus; the compound's ability to increase the fluorescence of EtBr and Sytox Green, as well as its ability to inhibit the expression of the mepA gene. The results showed that lauric acid had no antibacterial effect against S. aureus K2068. When combined with ciprofloxacin, the compound potentiated the effect of the antibiotic, reducing the MIC from 64 to 32 μg/mL and increasing the fluorescence of EtBr and Sytox Green, suggesting inhibition of MepA and greater permeabilization of the cell membrane. Furthermore, qPCR assays revealed that lauric acid promoted a reduction in mepA gene expression. Molecular docking indicated that lauric acid interacts with the efflux pump in a similar way to chlorpromazine through hydrophobic interaction with the Phe153 residue. ADME modeling suggested that lauric acid's moderate lipophilicity favors passive cell permeability. The results of the toxicity assays in D. melanogaster indicate that lauric acid and ciprofloxacin exhibit low toxicity in the evaluated model. Together, these findings suggest that lauric acid could be a promising antibiotic adjuvant and MepA efflux pump inhibitor in S. aureus.

Abstract: Accumulating epidemiological evidence links ozone exposure with cerebrocardiovascular morbidity, yet its microvascular impact remains poorly characterized. Retinal microvasculature alterations have emerged as sensitive biomarkers of systemic endothelial dysfunction and predictors of cerebrocardiovascular events. Our study comprised 55,463 individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), recruited across 249 community health centers spanning all 17 administrative districts of Shanghai in 2017. Exposure assessment utilized satellite-derived ozone concentration estimates at 1*1 km spatial resolution, aggregating five-year (2013–2017) ozone exposure metrics. Retinal vascular phenotyping included central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE), arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR), vascular tortuosity (VT), and fractal dimension (Df). The retinal age gap (RAG) is adopted to reflect accelerated aging, defined as the difference between deep learning-predicted retinal age and chronological age. Multivariable regression analyses using double machine learning showed that for every 10 μg/m3 increase in ozone, the decrease in the CRAE, CRVE, VT (×104) and Df (×103) were 4.03 (95 %CI: 3.04, 5.01)μm, 8.35 (95 %CI: 6.69, 10.00)μm, 0.38 (95 %CI: 0.28, 0.48) and 13.7 (95 %CI: 11.20, 16.21), respectively, and the increase in RAG was 2.29 (95 %CI: 2.04, 2.54) years. Mediation analysis revealed an association between ozone exposure and reductions in CRAE (indirect effect, standardized coefficient=-0.08, 95 %CI −0.09∼-0.07), CRVE (-0.07, −0.08∼-0.06), and Df (-0.11, −0.12∼-0.09) through the pathway of accelerated aging. Long-term ozone exposure correlates with accelerated retinal aging and microvascular remodeling (vessel narrowing, reduced tortuosity, fractal simplification), which provides novel biological evidence to elucidate the causal relationship between ozone exposure and cerebrocardiovascular risk.

Abstract: Seven compounds [palmitaldehyde (1), daucosterol (2), 24-propylcholesterol (3), asperin (4), vanillic acid (5), paprazine (6), and cycloalliin (7)] were isolated and characterised from aerial part of Allium semenovii Regel for the first time. Extract, fractions, and isolated compounds were assessed for antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase and tyrosinase enzyme inhibition activities. A maximum antioxidant potential was observed in compound 6 (IC50 =12.45 ± 0.69 µM, ABTS•+ and 377.67 ± 0.10 µM, DPPH•) followed by ethyl acetate (IC50 = 95.00 ± 0.15 µg/mL, ABTS•+) and chloroform fraction (IC50 = 370.00 ± 0.6 2 µg/mL, DPPH•). Chloroform fraction (IC50 = 172.50 ± 0.70 µg/mL) and compound 4 (IC50 = 108.01 ± 1.99 µM) showed higher acetylcholinesterase enzyme inhibition. Whereas, Compound 5 was found significant to inhibit tyrosinase enzyme (IC50 = 11.37 ± 0.16 µM). Hence, study suggested therapeutic potential of A. semenovii which could be due to presence of diversified compounds.

Abstract: Introduction
Individuals with affective disorders have been consistently found to exert chronic low-grade inflammation, particularly, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) hematic levels were observed in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Moreover, an association between suicidal behaviour and increased CRP hematic levels has been documented. Few studies specifically investigated all suicidality spectrum dimensions, by recruiting all affective disorders, e.g. MDD, bipolar disorder type-1 (BD-I), bipolar disorder type-2 (BD-II) and cyclothymic mood disorder (Cyc). Therefore, our study was designed to explore the association between a low-grade inflammatory state (as assessed by high-sensitivity CRP [hsCRP]) and all suicidal spectrum dimensions across affective spectrum disorders in a real-world setting.
Methods
A naturalistic observational cross-sectional study was carried out by retrospectively recruiting 225 adult inpatients with affective disorders (MDD, BD-I, BD-II, Cyc). As routine clinical practice, for all patients were collected: a) hsCRP levels within a full laboratory panel; b) anthropometric measures; c) short version of the MINI Suicidal Scale (MINI-5-s); d) short version of the Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego (brief-TEMPS-M).
Results
Within the total sample, 62.2 % reported thoughts of death in the last month, while 55.6 % experienced current suicidal ideation. According to a logistic regression model, thoughts of death were significantly predicted by higher score at the depressive subscale of TEMPS-M (Exp(B) = 1.069; 95 %IC = 1.021–1.119; p = 0.005) and higher hsCRP levels (Exp(B) = 1.818; 95 %IC = 1.053–3.139; p = 0.032).
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that hsCRP could potentially represent a relatively easy, cheap and early transdiagnostic inflammatory biomarker for suicidality across mood disorders, particularly among those displaying a predominant affective depressive temperament. Further studies should longitudinally explore clinical implication derived by the stratification of mood disorders according to the inflammatory pattern, as well as testing whether anti-inflammatory therapy could represent an early treatment strategy for managing suicidality risk.

Abstract: Fruits and fashionable smoothies are the basis of a healthy diet and are consumed worldwide. Due to the various agricultural practices in global fruit cultivation, pesticides can sometimes pose a threat. The novelty of this work was the presentation of the pesticide distribution picture in 440 fruit and 350 smoothie samples produced in 19 different countries available to consumers in Polish hypermarkets. Moreover, an interesting legal analysis of the status of detected pesticides in the context of European legislation was conducted. An essential element of the research was assessing the cumulative risk for two groups of high–risk pesticides: endocrine and developmental disruptors for children and adults. The investigation of pesticides was carried out using highly advanced LC/MS/MS and GC/MS/MS techniques. Pesticides were detected in a significant number of fruits (400 samples) and smoothies (329 samples). The grape sample contained up to 18 residues, reaching a total concentration of 6.52 mg kg−1. Generally, the levels of detected residues were several times higher in fruits than in smoothies. EU MRL standards were exceeded in 4.5 % of samples, extreme of 420 % chlorpyrifos/oranges. Alarmingly, about 30 % of fruit samples and 17 % of smoothies were found to contain not approved pesticides in Europe. Acute health risk was the highest for tebuconazole/grapefruits/children (785 % ARfD) and imazalil/oranges/adults (375 % ARfD). The cumulative acute health risk was determined for endocrine and reproductive disruptors with a hazard index of up to 13. Fruits with multiple residues are a serious public health problem due to cumulative health risk, especially for children.

Abstract: Peripherally-induced movement disorder (PIMD) is a group of conditions manifested by involuntary movements or other motor abnormalities that are induced by or emerge in the context of injury to the peripheral nervous system. Peripheral nerve entrapment (PNE) in the upper extremities is common and their clinical signs are very well known by hand surgeons. Only 3 cases of tremor with PNE have already been reported (one in 1986 and two very recently). The aim of this multicentric retrospective study is to report clinical cases of tremors caused by PNE and to analyze their clinical findings and treatment. 17 patients was referred to 5 hand centers for tremors of their hand after being examined by a neurologist clinically and electrophysiologically. The clinical examination showed simple, double or multiple crush nerve entrapment at the upper limb (elbow was involved for all of them except one). The treatment was conservative (myofascial manipulation and taping) for 8 patients and surgical (wide awake nerve release) for 9 others after failure of conservative treatments. The tremors disappeared for all of them. Our study showed upper limb peripheral nerve entrapment can be a cause of tremor of the hand in rare but misdiagnosed situations. We suggest that tremor induced by peripheral nerve entrapment can be a new type of tremor classified in the PIMD group. Hand physiotherapist and surgeons must be questioned by medical doctors who take care of tremors (family doctors, neurologists …) and so, be awared of that etiology.

Abstract: Resistant starch (RS), an indigestible dietary carbohydrate, plays a pivotal role in modulating gut health through microbial fermentation to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, propionate, and butyrate which mediate multiple health benefits. Accumulating evidence highlights that the digestive resistance and fermentative behavior of RS are fundamentally determined by its structural characteristics, such as amylose-to-amylopectin ratio, granule morphology, crystalline type, chain-length distribution, and interactions with other food components. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on the classification and structural domains of RS, their influence on fermentation kinetics and SCFA profiles, and their interactions with gut microbiota. Additionally, we discuss how these structure-function relationships translate into health outcomes and inform the development of functional starch ingredients. Emerging strategies, including genetic breeding for high amylose content, controlled physical processing, chemical modification, and esterification with SCFAs, offer opportunities to tailor RS properties for specific nutritional goals. Future research directions should further clarify how these structural attributes can be leveraged within precision nutrition frameworks to develop functional foods and dietary interventions aligned with individual microbiome variability and health needs.

Abstract: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), aimed at rebuilding gut microbiota, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach to central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the therapeutic effects of FMT against demyelination-related white matter injury (WMI) have not yet been clarified under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) condition. We therefore explored the potential roles and mechanisms of FMT on CCH-induced WMI, focusing on myelin integrity, axonal survival, and oligodendrogenesis. FMT restored mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I–V activities and promoted the changes of pyruvate metabolism from lactate-generated to acetyl-CoA-generated mode, strengthening mitochondrial ATP production. Furthermore, FMT mitigated CCH-induced demyelination and axonal degeneration, effects mediated in part by oligodendrogenesis-dependent remyelination. Moreover, FMT altered CCH-induced gut microbiota composition by increasing the proportions of some bacterial groups including Verrucomicrobiae, Akkermansiaceae, Verrucomicrobiales, Verrucomicrobiota, Akkermansia, and Akkermansia_muciniphila. These gut microbiota were strongly associated with elevated fecal levels of L-tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and N-a-acetylcitrulline, as well as with increased hippocampal concentrations of L-arginine, L-glutamine, N2-succinyl-L-ornithine, N-acetylornithine, indolepyruvate, indoleacetaldehyde, kynurenic acid, 11, 12-EET, 11, 12-DiHETrE and prostaglandin A2, which were almost involved in tryptophan and arginine related metabolism pathways. This study highlights the beneficial effects of FMT strategy in response to demyelination-mediated WMI under chronic cerebral ischemia condition.

Abstract: Innate immune sensing through cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) surveils cytosolic DNA from invading pathogens or damaged organelles and initiates a spectrum of immune responses. It is well established that upon 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) binding, STING exits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), traverses the Golgi to trigger interferon programs, and finally reaches lysosomes for signal resolution through degradation, revealing a tightly choreographed itinerary for cytokine-driven immunity. However, emerging studies reveal additional layers of spatiotemporal complexity: ER-resident STING tunes in messenger RNA translation and Ca2+ efflux, Golgi-localized STING functions as a proton channel that initiates H+-dependent autophagy and transcription factor EB-directed programs for organelle homeostasis, and various mechanisms for metabolic remodeling and cell fate determination. This review synthesizes emerging organelle-specific mechanisms of cGAS–STING, delineates their roles in physiology and disease, and discusses how an organelle-centric perspective may inform selective, context-sensitive immunotherapies.

Abstract: Due to the numerous issues associated with many current drug therapies, including lack of efficiency and off-target toxicity, targeted drug delivery has become a critical area of pharmaceutical research. Natural compounds show great promise for active drug targeting, since many of them possess distinct activity towards biomolecules in human body. That includes peptide toxins derived from venoms of various animals, which have often been tailored by evolution to target biomolecules in living systems with high potency and specificity. In this review, we discuss the current research on the use of venom peptides for specific tissue targeting, in order to deliver therapeutic or diagnostic agents. Various delivery systems, predominantly nanoparticles and bioconjugates, have been developed using either natural, or modified venom peptides. Among these, chlorotoxin, a scorpion-derived toxin, and exendin-4, from lizard venom, have shown particular promise in targeted delivery. While many of these delivery systems have been designed for cancer or nervous system targeting, other conditions have also been approached. Besides therapeutic drug delivery, numerous targeted imaging agents have been developed and investigated for precise visualization of specific conditions.

Abstract: In mammalian cells, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) participates in the regulation of diverse cellular processes such as ATP production, oxidative stress resistance, DNA repair, metabolic homeostasis, and inflammation. Due to these properties, exogenously applied NAD+ precursors (nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, nicotinamide riboside, and nicotinamide mononucleotide) can protect organs and cells of mammalian against detrimental effects of various stress factors and diseases. For instance, NAD+ and its precursors have critical importance for the in vivo and in vitro fertilization success of mammals. This review summarizes that the natural aging process, diseases, and toxic compounds cause the detrimental effects in the reproductive parameters of the in vivo models, such as the meiotic defects and the reductions in cellular NAD+ level, mitochondrial functions, sperm and oocyte quality, blastocyst and embryo formation rate, implantation success, whereas the intragastric, intraperitoneal or oral administration of NAD+ precursors prevents or attenuates these detrimental effects. Similarly, the supplementation of NAD+ precursors can protect the oocytes and sperms against the cryopreservation process, aging and toxic compounds in the in vitro and also enhances blastocyst and embryo formation in vitro. This review study also revealed that the ability of NAD+ precursors-loaded drug delivery systems to prevent reproductive defects has not yet been investigated in literature. Therefore, we recommend the development of NAD+ precursor-loaded drug delivery systems targeting reproductive system organs and/or cell organelles (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus). To achieve this, hormone receptors in testicular and ovarian cells can be targeted. Similarly, triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) can be used to specifically target mitochondria.

Abstract: The Reactome Graph Database, which describes biological processes in 28 top-level pathways and facilitates efficient data- traversal and retrieval, has been used in a novel way to generate pathway fingerprints for 862 cancer driver- and 324 comorbidity-associated- genes; the latter set of genes cause Mendelian Diseases (MDs) which are comorbid with cancer. A pathway fingerprint presents pathway information about a gene in a novel way. It lists all pathways in which the gene participates, top-level-pathway-wise, the latter in decreasing order of importance. Data related to the above two sets of genes have also been mined from cBioPortal, OMIM, published literature on cancer-MD comorbidity and the NCI-compiled list of targeted therapies approved for cancers. Pathway fingerprints have connected- and added value to- data mined from the different repositories, and yielded insights into cancer and cancer-MD comorbidity. (1) Driver mutations in eight cancer datasets from cBioPortal, and allelic variants (AVs) from OMIM, were extracted for the cancer driver genes; the AVs were searched for among the driver mutations. Only by using the pathway fingerprints of driver genes was it possible to discern that the majority of cancer genes, which recruit AVs as somatic cancer mutations, play their most important role in the Signal Transduction top-level pathway. (2) OMIM-catalogued-, deleterious- AVs in comorbidity-associated genes also occur as somatic mutations in cancers, though infrequently. While in the study their occurrence appears not to be random, in the literature they are regarded as random passenger mutations. In over half the mutations, R is the mutated residue, R→TER mutations being the most frequent. (3) A comparison of the pathway fingerprints of comorbidity-associated- and cancer- genes has shown that the largest number of shared pathways between the two sets of genes belongs to the Signal Transduction top-level pathway. Thus, mutated comorbidity-associated genes help cancer by adding to the burden of aberrant signal transduction. (4) Comorbidity-associated genes which cause Mendelian Inborn Errors of Metabolism tend not to share their disease-causing pathway with cancer genes while contributing to comorbidity. (5) Examining gene targets used in targeted cancer therapies, along with co-occurring genes of each target, yielded novel drug combinations for combination therapy; e.g., Desmopressin as an adjuvant for Dasatinib treatment. (6) Examining the pathway fingerprints of mutated driver genes in each cancer has shown that Signal Transduction and Gene expression are the most-affected top-level pathways in cancers, followed by Cell-Cycle, Developmental Biology and Immune System. (7) Targets for drug design have been identified from the set of genes causing the most prominent effects in the above top-level pathways. (8) Gene networks have been generated which show that: (i) the same source gene, in the same top-level pathway, interacts with similar target genes in different cancers; (ii) if the same source gene, in the same cancer, acts in different top-level pathways, one may identify top-level pathways that are connected by the source gene; (iii) if, in the same top-level pathway, in the same cancer, different source genes act, one may identify source genes that are connected.

Abstract: Graphene oxide (GO) has become a very promising platform for hyperthermia-based cancer treatment because it has a large surface area, can have its surface chemistry changed, and is great at photothermal therapy. This review provides a comprehensive examination of GO-based bio-nanocomposites engineered for accurate drug delivery and regulated hyperthermia treatment. We critically evaluate diverse synthesis and functionalization methodologies that enhance GO's properties for biomedical applications, highlighting its superiority compared to alternative nanomaterials. The review elucidates the fundamental mechanisms of photothermal (PTT) and magnetothermic (MTT) therapies, demonstrating how GO-based systems can be effectively integrated with chemotherapy and immunotherapy to augment therapeutic efficacy via synergistic effects. These platforms also support drug release that responds to stimuli and real-time theranostic imaging methods like MRI and SERS. Even though they have high drug-loading efficiencies (up to 95 %) and have been shown to work well in preclinical models to shrink tumors, there are still problems with toxicity, long-term stability, nanoparticle aggregation, and controlling the exact distribution of heat. This review stands out because it compares different ways to make GO and tests how well GO works compared to other hyperthermia platforms. We discuss about possible solutions to these problems in the future. These include environmentally friendly synthesis methods, aptamer-based targeting, and the use of advanced fabrication technologies like 3D printing and microfluidics. We also discuss about how to combine hyperthermia with immunotherapy and other biophysical treatments. These new ideas are likely to lead to the creation of next-generation cancer treatments that can do many things and make the most of combination treatment strategies.

Abstract: Objectives
This study aimed to establish a nomogram to predict malnutrition risk in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Design
A retrospective cohort study.
Setting
A Grade III, Class A hospital in Zhejiang Province.
Participants
Patients with primary PD meeting the inclusion criteria were retrospectively identified from the electronic medical record system (January 2023–December 2024) for study inclusion.
Methods
This study included 21 research variables, encompassing demographic characteristics, physiological features, physical functional status, disease type, and severity. Optimal variables were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Internal validation was performed via bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations), and a nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of malnutrition in patients with PD.
Results
This study included 215 patients with PD for model construction, with a malnutrition prevalence of 35.6 %. The LASSO regression and logistic regression models identified seven significant predictors of malnutrition: lower body mass index, advanced H-Y stage, decreased poorer Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale Part III Maximum Improvement Rate, decreased red blood cell count, reduced total cholesterol, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and dysphagia (P < 0.05). The model achieved an area under the curve of 0.814 (95 % CI: 0.754–0.874), with 70.1 % sensitivity, 76.1 % specificity, and a Youden’s index of 0.462, indicating robust predictive performance.
Conclusion
The prediction model constructed based on Mini Nutritional Assessment scores demonstrated strong predictive performance and holds significant clinical importance for identifying malnutrition in patients with PD.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Assessing end-of-life care quality is important yet selecting measures remains challenging. This umbrella review synthesizes evidence on measures for EOL outcomes—quality of life (QOL), care experience, quality of dying (QOD), and suffering.
Methods
We searched five databases for systematic reviews published, 01 January 2009–29 July 2025. Included reviews assessed QOL, care experience, QOD and suffering measures for terminally ill adults and caregivers. We used AMSTAR2 to assess review quality and reported psychometrics per COSMIN. This study is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024610359).
Findings
From 30 reviews, we extracted 161 unique measures: 83 for QOL, 49 for care experience, 15 for QOD, and 14 for suffering. No single measure showed sufficient psychometric robustness. Among generic measures, those with stronger evidence included Palliative Care Outcome Scale (QOL); Family Assessment of Treatment at End-of-life, Care of the Dying Evaluation, and Quality of End-of-Life Care (care experience); Quality of Dying and Death Questionnaire (QOD); and Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self-Measure, and Patient Dignity Inventory (suffering).
Interpretation
In this review, we recommended measures with stronger evidence and developed a checklist to guide selection based on domain relevance, disease group, population fit, and psychometrics. Future research should pursue rigorous validation and standardized reporting to strengthen assessment of end-of-life care.
Funding

Abstract: Cancer is a prominent public health, economic and societal bane in contemporary time, accounting for about one in every six deaths (16.8%) and one in four mortality (22.8%) from non-communicable diseases globally. Asides being a major limitation to ameliorating life expectancy, this disease is related with substantial macroeconomic and societal expenses that differs in degree across gender, geography and cancer types. Although, there has been significant advancements in cancer treatments, challenges such as, severe side effects, limited long-term efficacy and drug resistance are still encountered. Therefore, it is critical to explore alternatives or adjuncts to conventional therapies like natural bioactive compounds as a potential feasible cancer treatment therapy. Bioactive components of natural compounds might provide benefits to human health beyond fundamental nutrition to the reduction of chronic illnesses including cancer. Phenolic compounds have earned significant interest amongst all the phytochemicals components due to their diverse bioactivities. They possess anti-carcinogenic properties as a result of the induction of cellular defence mechanisms, detoxification of enzymes and anti-inflammatory activities, and they possess vast health benefits to humans such anti-inflammatory, chemo-preventive, anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic properties. However, rapid metabolism, dearth of extensive clinical trials and poor bioavailability hinders therapeutic application of this compound. These limitations could be addressed through the development of novel drug delivery systems such as the employment of innovative nanocarriers like nanobots and 2D/3D, combination therapies and structural modifications. These technologies have brought to light the delivery of phenolic compounds. In this study, a review on the anti-cancer actions and mechanisms of action of phenolic compounds, innovative pathways in which phenolic compounds can be delivered and Strategies for advancing phenolic compounds and their Nano-formulations from Preclinical research to Clinical and Market Utilization is summarized.

Abstract: Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and potent toxicant. Cr(VI) exposure impacts millions of people around the world, primarily through inhalation or ingestion. Such exposures are best known for contributing to cancers of the lung, sinus, and nasal passage, damage to kidneys and liver, and contact dermatitis. Growing evidence indicates exposure contributes to neurological conditions, but knowledge gaps persist regarding Cr(VI) neurotoxicity. Human studies report Cr(VI) contributes to autism spectrum disorders, motor neuron disease, olfactory dysfunction, and impaired memory. However, knowledge of specific targets for Cr(VI) in the brain is limited to reports of regional accumulation (greatest effects reported in the rodent hippocampus, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland), while cell-specific effects remain unknown. Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful high-throughput model, frequently used for metals neurotoxicity. Here, we characterize a C. elegans model to address knowledge gaps in Cr(VI) neurotoxicity. All Cr(VI) concentrations tested were sublethal, and we estimate bioaccumulation of Cr in worms was ∼1e10−8% of the administered dose after a 24-hour exposure. Cr(VI) initially targeted GABAergic neurons after a 6-hour exposure, while cholinergic, dopaminergic, and GABAergic neurons were affected following a 24-hour exposure. Impacts on behaviors were consistent with neurodegeneration. Further, Cr(VI) exacerbated gut autofluorescence in worms, indicative of accelerated biological aging. These data collectively address key knowledge gaps, identifying key neuronal targets and informing potential mechanisms of neurotoxicity.

Abstract: Background
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes, often leading to pain, disability, and reduced quality of life (QoL). Complementary medicine practices, such as acupressure, are increasingly used by patients with diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of auricular acupressure (AA) on neuropathic symptoms and QoL in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, 41 participants with type 2 diabetic neuropathy meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=20) or the sham group (n=21). The intervention group received auriculotherapy by applying pressure to labels containing five plant seeds placed on the foot reflex area of the external ear three times daily for six weeks. The sham group received pressure on labels containing five plant seeds placed on the cardiac reflex area of the external ear for the same duration. Data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) questionnaire, and the Neuropathy-Specific Quality of Life (Neuro-QoL) questionnaire, administered before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21, employing independent t-tests, paired t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, and chi-square tests, with a significance level set at p<0.05.
Results
Before the intervention, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of neuropathy symptom severity. After the intervention, the intervention group demonstrated a significant reduction in neuropathy symptoms (p<0.001), while the reduction in the sham group was not statistically significant (p=0.17). Additionally, QoL scores improved significantly in the intervention group post-intervention (p<0.001).
Conclusion
Auriculotherapy appears to be a cost-effective, non-invasive, and practical approach for reducing neuropathic symptoms and improving QoL in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Chronic stress in confined environments can disrupt the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the characteristic microbial and metabolic alterations in socially and radically basic activity-restricted people in confined environments (SRBARC) remain unclear. This study integrated assessments of emotional states, gut microbiota, and metabolomic profiles to investigate theirinterrelationships in SRBARC, aiming to identify characteristic microbes and metabolites. The results suggested that the SRBARC tend to exhibit depressive/anxiety-like behaviors, accompanied by hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation, suppressed testosterone, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Full-length 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated lower Shannon and Chao1 indices in the gut microbiota of the SRBARC. Random forest analysis combined with dual-cohort verification suggested that Blautia massiliensis, Blautia wexlerae, Coprococcus comes, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lachnospiraceae bacterium may serve as characteristic microbes with diagnostic value (discovery cohort AUC = 0.836, validation cohort AUC = 0.840). Metabolomic analysis of feces, serum and urine revealed alterations in amino acid metabolism and disruptions in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis in the SRBARC, which affected serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) pathways. Four metabolites, including 5-methoxytryptophol, were identified as potentially metabolites associated with emotional states. These characteristic microorganisms and metabolic features were associated with neuroinflammation and immunity, and their interactions may play a key role in regulating emotional states in SRBARC. In summary, this study suggested a potential interplay among gut microbiota, neurotransmitter metabolism, and emotional states in the SRBARC, identifying potential key microbial signatures and metabolites that may provide a theoretical foundation for developing gut microbiota-based intervention strategies.

Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a diverse collection of neurodevelopmental disorders often accompanied by excessive oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory responses. Selenium (Se), a trace element, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. The present study aimed to examine the effects of sodium selenite, a Se supplement, on a rat model of ASD. The valproic acid intervention method was used during pregnancy to construct an ASD rat model. Rats were then treated with sodium selenite. Behavioral tests, morphological assessments, and measurements of antioxidant enzymes, oxidative stress indicators, and inflammatory factors in the hippocampal tissues and serum were conducted. Se supplementation mitigated inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in ASD rats while preserving neuronal morphology and function. In addition to Se supplementation, rats received specific inhibitors targeting the signaling pathway. Protein and mRNA expression levels, as well as the tissue distribution of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), were evaluated. The results demonstrated that Se treatment upregulated the expression levels of Sirt1, Nrf2, and HO-1, while downregulating Keap1 expression. These findings demonstrate that Se attenuates inflammatory damage and oxidative stress in the brain, and this protective effect is associated with the Sirt1/Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.

Abstract: Abstract:
Objective
Apathy appears as a common neuropsychiatric symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate its prevalence, associated contributing factors, and clinical impact by a meta-analysis approach.
Methods
Studies published before October 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Data were analyzed using STATA 12.0 software.
Results
The pooled prevalence of apathy in PD was 37% [95% confidence interval (CI): 33% to 41%]. Compared with PD patients without apathy (PD-NA), PD patients with apathy (PD-A) were older [standard mean difference (SMD) = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.35], more likely to be male (SMD = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.14), and had lower educational levels (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI: -0.38 to -0.19). Clinically, PD-A showed worse motor performance with higher scores on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale III (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.66) and Hoehn and Yahr stage (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.56). They also exhibit more general cognitive impairment (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI: -0.50 to -0.24), and greater depressive symptoms (SMD = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.15). Therapeutically, PD-A required increased levodopa doses (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.32) and more frequent use of antidepressants (SMD = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.36).
Conclusions
Apathy is prevalent in PD and associated with greater motor, cognitive, and emotional dysfunction. Early identification and targeted interventions for apathy would improve the disease management and enhance the quality of life for PD patients.

Abstract: Clinical reasoning workshops improve the ability of nurse practitioner (NP) students to develop clinical reasoning and diagnostic skills. These workshops help NP students identify and address information gaps while enhancing decision-making and situational awareness. However, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the implementation of reasoning workshops in advanced pharmacology courses and the earlier courses in an NP curriculum. Virtual unfolding case studies, combined with team-based learning, can help fill this gap. An innovative educational approach and outcome evaluation strategy are presented for conducting such workshops via online conferencing for student NPs taking pharmacology courses.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) consist of factual triples that describe relations between entities in the real world. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to map entities and relations into constantly low-dimensional vectors, which is important for lots of downstream tasks (e.g., KG completion and information retrieval). Current KGE methods primarily rely on explicit structural patterns, neglecting latent contextual semantics behind those structures and resulting in sub-optimal performance. While some methods incorporate additional data (e.g., textual descriptions), such dependencies limit applicability due to additional data requirements. Furthermore, most KGE models suffer from limited supervision with sparse labeled triples, restricting their capacity to learn comprehensive semantic features. Inspired by the simple but effective self-supervised language model word2vec, one interesting question is: Can KGE be performed as a simple self-supervised language model? To achieve this, we innovatively propose a self-supervised KGE framework that learns entity and relation embeddings by adapting word2vec’s skip-gram objective to path sequences extracted from KGs. Our framework employs separate embedding spaces for entities and relations with an entity-relation mapping mechanism for effective interaction between the two embedding spaces. Further, to enhance the training efficiency, we introduce a markov chain-based negative sampling strategy, which generates semantically meaningful negative samples by preserving the structural contexts along KG paths. Our framework, which is the first attempt to follow the context-based self-supervised idea of language models to conduct KGE tasks, addresses the constraints of label-dependent supervised KGE techniques and obviates the requirement for external information, while simultaneously enabling effective extraction of the implicit contextual semantics inherent in triple structures. Experiments on two widely-used KGE datasets show state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating our framework’s ability to learn semantically rich representations solely from graph structure.

Abstract: Background
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), a major cause of low back pain, is characterized by cartilage endplate (CEP) degeneration, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and oxidative stress. Deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, demonstrates efficacy in treating iron-overload disorders.
Objective
This study aimed to systematically investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of DFO in IVDD and ferroptosis.
Methods
We employed bioinformatics analysis, in vitro cell models, and an in vivo mouse IVDD model.
Results
Bioinformatics identified 65 common targets for DFO and IVDD, implicating mitochondrial function regulation, oxidative stress response, and the HIF-1α signaling pathway. In vitro, 100 μM DFO restored tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-induced suppression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, enhanced COL2 and SOX9 expression, and suppressed MMP3, COL10, and RUNX2 expression, mitigating calcification. In vivo, 100 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks DFO alleviated IVDD pathology in the IVDD model. DFO promoted mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) via the HIF-1α/BNIP3 axis, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and increased glutathione (GSH) and GPX4 expression. Mechanistic studies confirmed that DFO inhibits ferroptosis and CEP degeneration by activating HIF-1α/BNIP3-mediated mitophagy.
Conclusion
DFO ameliorates CEP degeneration in IVDD by targeting oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Its protective effects are mediated through multi-targeted mechanisms, prominently involving the activation of HIF-1α/BNIP3-mediated mitophagy to suppress ferroptosis. These findings highlight DFO as a promising therapeutic strategy for IVDD and ferroptosis-related pathologies.

Abstract: Reliable and selective sensing of homocysteine (Hcy) is essential for early screening and prevention of chronic diseases in elderly populations. In this work, we proposed a new " on-off " signal ratio sensing strategy. Specifically, homocysteine (Hcy) and catechol (Cat) were chosen as dual-signal probes, and the ratio sensing perform of Hcy was constructed by monitoring the dynamic changes of I4-SH-Cat/ICat and IHcy/ICat. The linear response range covered 5.76 × 10-⁹ ∼ 1.23 × 10-⁴ M, with a low detection limit of 1.92 nM. Furthermore, the electrochemical reaction mechanism was explored thoroughly based on 1,4-Michael addition reaction between Hcy and Cat. Importantly, the proposed ratio electrochemical method can selectively identify Hcy in the presence of cysteine (Cys). Therefore, the study provides an effective method for realizing fast, reliable and sensitive determination of Hcy, and exhibits significant application value in biomedical analysis and clinical diagnosis for early screening of Hcy-related diseases.

Abstract: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) based dual-mode sensing and photocurrent polarity switchable PEC are highly promising analytical strategies for increasing sensitivity and accuracy. However, the construction of a sensing platform integrating both mechanisms faces challenges. Herein, a novel PEC-fluorescence (FL) dual-mode triple-signal sensing platform is proposed for dopamine (DA) detection based on the polydopamine (PDA) and phosphate-induced FL quenching and photocurrent polarity reversal dual mechanism. Silver sulfide quantum dots (Ag2S QDs), acting as both FL probe and PEC enhancer for the SnO2 and sulfur-doped BiOCl (SnO2/SBOC). In the presence of DA, PDA forms and adheres onto the surface of Ag2S QDs in alkaline conditions, effectively quenching the FL of Ag2S QDs. The resulting PDA@Ag2S droplets on the SnO2/SBOC and creates a multi-heterojunction structure that significantly enhances the PEC response. PO43− facilitates the substitution of sulfur and chlorine atoms in the SBOC, creating a shielding effect that impedes electron conduction and induces photocurrent polarity reversal of the sensing platform. The detection of DA is achieved with an ultralow detection limit of 1.2 × 10−8 M and wide linear detection range of 0.20–225 μM. The designed dual-mode, three-signal sensing strategy greatly improves the sensitivity and reliability, enabling self-calibration of the detection results. PDA and phosphate-induced polarity conversion presents a pioneering perspective for advanced biosensing, highlighting its potential for future applications.

Abstract: Summary
Microglia, the principal immune cells of the central nervous system, have emerged as important players in sensing and regulating neuronal activity. While microglial activation is a hallmark in neurodegeneration, the specific role of microglia in disease-related cortical excitability remains unknown. Utilizing multichannel probe recordings and longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging, we observed neuronal hyperactivity at the initial stage of disease progression in a mouse model of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) neurodegeneration (rNLS8, regulated nuclear localization sequence-deleted human TDP-43 transgenic mouse model). Spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a specific subpopulation of microglia, rod-shaped microglia, with a distinct morphology and direct response to cortical hyperactivity. Rod-shaped microglia predominantly interacted with neuronal dendrites and remodeled excitatory synaptic inputs to attenuate motor cortical hyperactivity. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) deficiency led to a marked reduction of rod-shaped microglia accompanied by increased neuronal activity in rNLS8 mice. Together, our results suggest that rod-shaped microglia play a neuroprotective role by attenuating cortical hyperexcitability in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, is characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration with limited treatment options. The natural flavonoid farrerol exhibits neuroprotective potential through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, but its therapeutic application is limited by poor bioavailability and photodegradation. This study investigates farrerol's neuroprotective mechanisms and develops an optimized nanoformulation for enhanced efficacy. In vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) and in vivo ischemia-reperfusion (IR) models demonstrate that farrerol significantly improves RGC survival and visual function. Mechanistic studies reveal that farrerol activates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway, reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and modulates key ferroptosis markers (glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4)), thereby inhibiting RGC apoptosis. To overcome delivery limitations, farrerol-loaded bilirubin nanoparticles (FB-NPs) are developed, showing enhanced stability and neuroprotective effects in glaucomatous injury models. These findings identify the Nrf2/ferroptosis/apoptosis axis as a novel therapeutic target and present an effective nanodelivery strategy for glaucoma treatment.

Abstract: Background
Comorbidities are associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure (HF). However, comorbidities usually cluster together and data on the association between multimorbidity clusters and incident HF with preserved (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are lacking.
Methods
We identified multimorbidity patterns in 6839 participants from the prospective observational Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease (PREVEND) cohort study using latent class analysis and investigated their association with new-onset HF.
Results
The participants' mean age at baseline was 53.8 years, and 50 % were women. We identified six multimorbidity clusters: 1) young [N = 2118, youngest age and lowest number of chronic conditions], 2) elderly [N = 1198, oldest age, high prevalence of chronic kidney disease and hypercholesterolemia], 3) pulmonary disease [N = 578, high prevalence of respiratory problems], 4) psychosomatic [N = 527, high prevalence of myalgic encephalomyelitis, anxiety and stress], 5) psychological [N = 1815, high prevalence of depression] and 6) obese/physical inactivity [N = 603, high prevalence of obesity, hypertension, myocardial infarction and stroke]. During 110,621 person-years of follow-up 622 participants developed heart failure of which 390 with HFrEF and 220 with HFpEF. After adjusting for potential confounders, the elderly (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.46, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.89–3.20), pulmonary disease (aHR 2.10, 95 % CI 1.51–2.92), and obese/physical inactivity (aHR 3.80, 95 % CI 2.86–5.06) clusters had a higher risk of HF compared with the young cluster, which had the lowest risk. Among all clusters, patients were more likely to develop HFrEF compared to HFpEF. However, the obese/physical inactivity cluster was relatively more likely to develop HFpEF than HFrEF.
Conclusions
Comorbidities naturally clustered in six distinct multimorbidity clusters, each impacting participants' HF risk differently. These data emphasize the importance of addressing multimorbidity as a risk factor for HF.

Abstract: Objectives
We evaluated how frequently vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) include family spillover effects, costs or health impacts on family members who care for or about patients, and how their inclusion affects results.
Methods
Using the Tufts CEA Registry, we performed a systematic review to identify English-language CEAs published from January 2013 to December 2022 from the societal perspective. We selected CEAs for the four vaccines most evaluated within our search, examined how frequently these CEAs included family spillover effects, and how this inclusion changed CEA results.
Results
Among 268 vaccine CEAs meeting inclusion criteria, the top four vaccines were: human papillomavirus (n = 21), influenza (n = 57), pneumococcal (n = 37), and rotavirus (n = 25). (137 studies, 51 % of total). Of these, 65 (47.4 %) included family spillover effects, predominately time costs (n = 64, 98.5 %). Only four studies (6.2 %) included family spillover health effects. From 30 studies, we created 266 pairs of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), with each pair consisting of one ICER calculated with and then without family spillover effects. We then compared each pair to assess the impact of including family spillover effects on the ICERs. With 29 ICERs (10.9 %), including family spillover changed the result from a positive ICER, with a positive cost and benefit, to cost-saving, with a negative cost and a positive benefit. In 30 cases (11.3 %), ICERs remained cost-saving and in 207 cases (77.8 %) ICERs remained positive, with and without spillover effects. Among these, 206 pairs (99.5 %) showed a mean ICER reduction of 18.8 %, while one pair (0.5 %) increased by 13.3 %.
Conclusions
Approximately half of vaccine CEAs in our sample excluded family spillover effects. When included, most added family spillover costs but rarely family health effects, and generally showed more favorable results. Future vaccine CEAs should appropriately include family spillover effects to reflect vaccines' full value and support evidence-based decision-making.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) share a common pathologic hallmark i.e. loss of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), despite diverse pathological manifestations. These diseases present major challenges to global health due to incurable or extremely difficult to treat, imposing a heavy burden on society and families. Stem cell therapy, as a novel promising approach for treating various neurological diseases, harnesses the regenerative potential of stem cells to repair damaged neural tissues and circuits, and has become the only hope for patients to recover their health or delay the deterioration of disease symptoms. In recent years, researchers have successfully generated neurons from multiple types of stem cells, and good curative effects have been achieved in their animal models and in clinical trials. This comprehensive review elaborates on the relevant content of stem cell biology, focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of the current application status of various stem cells in major neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases including MS, AD, PD and ALS, kindling the hope for the development of stem cell-based cell therapies in neurological diseases.

Abstract: The increasing demand for energy and the urgency of reducing CO2 emissions have accelerated the development of renewable energy technologies. Among these, chemical looping biomass gasification (CL-BG) presents a promising pathway for sustainable syngas (CO + H2) production. This study presents a comprehensive thermodynamic evaluation of iron-based bimetallic oxygen carriers (OCs) for CL-BG systems using ASPEN Plus simulation software. By systematically varying the composition of transition metal oxides (CuO, CoO, NiO, Mn3O4) in combination with iron oxide (Fe2O3) and silicon carbide (SiC) as an inert support, the performance of over 60 OCs was analyzed under isothermal and adiabatic conditions. Isothermal operation of the reducer revealed a significant reduction in the reducer heat duty for CuO-modified OCs. Key process parameters, including syngas yields, oxygen carrier circulation rate, and OC conversion, were evaluated at optimal operating regions where autothermal operation (no requirement of external heat) has been established for the CL-BG system. The results revealed that OC composition with 26.67 % of the active material (AM) of the OC substituted by CuO exhibited the most significant improvement, enabling a ∼29 % reduction in oxygen carrier circulation rate and a ∼9 % increase in syngas yield. The CL-BG process was further integrated with a Fischer-Tropsch (F.T.) unit to assess process-level implications of using composite OCs for liquid fuel synthesis. Results demonstrate that the OC composition with 26.67 % CuO in the AM reduces auxiliary resource demands (steam, oxygen) and enhances product yields (gasoline and diesel), achieving ∼50 % higher fuel yield compared to Fe2O3 OC. This study provides a robust framework for designing composite metal OCs tailored for scalable and efficient chemical looping systems for sustainable chemical production.

Abstract: Background
Laparoscopic pyloroplasty and gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) relieve symptoms in most patients with refractory gastroparesis (GP). However, approximately 28% of patients who underwent pyloroplasty and an estimated 13% of patients who underwent G-POEM per year experience primary or secondary failure. Evidence-based guidance on what to do next is lacking. This study aimed to synthesize current data on the evaluation and treatment of patients with GP after failed pyloric drainage and propose a pragmatic, algorithm-oriented pathway for multidisciplinary care.
Methods
A structured narrative review was conducted by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for English-language literature (January 2000-July 2025) using keywords, such as “gastroparesis,” “pyloroplasty,” “G-POEM,” “gastric electrical stimulation,” and “gastrectomy,” combined with “failure” or “recurrence.” More than 40 pertinent studies were selected based on relevance to the postpyloric intervention setting. Predictors of failure, diagnostic strategies, and salvage interventions were extracted and integrated into tables and an illustrative algorithm.
Results
Clear definitions of clinical and objective failure are essential but heterogeneous across studies. Predictors of poor outcome include younger age, higher baseline Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index, longer disease duration, higher body mass index, psychiatric medication use, and persistent postprocedure gastric retention. Postfailure management begins with confirmation of failure, medication/diet optimization, and repeat endoscopy and gastric emptying scintigraphy. Endoluminal functional lumen imaging probe or antroduodenal manometry may refine phenotyping. Salvage options are tailored to physiology and symptom profile: redo G-POEM for suspected technical recurrence, gastric electrical stimulation for persistent nausea and vomiting, jejunostomy with venting gastrostomy for severe malnutrition, and, for the most refractory cases, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or near-total gastrectomy, each with distinct risk-benefit profiles. An evidence-based decision tree is provided to support shared decision-making.
Conclusion
Failed pyloric drainage underscores the complex, multimechanistic nature of GP. A structured algorithm that blends symptom assessment, objective testing, and staged interventions can individualize care while highlighting gaps – namely, standardized failure criteria and comparative effectiveness trials – that warrant future research.

Abstract: Metabolic dysfunction of insulin resistance (IR) may compromise brain function decades before overt disease. We assessed biomarkers of peripheral and central IR for three years in 125 cognitively intact adults without diabetes or depression (23–61 y) to clarify their relative contributions to trajectories of metabolic and cognitive change. Peripheral IR was quantified by measuring steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentration during the insulin-suppression test and ancillary metabolic indices; central IR was indexed by phosphorylated insulin-receptor-substrate-1 (p-IRS1) in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEs) isolated from plasma. Mixed-effects models controlling for age, sex and BMI showed that higher baseline SSPG concentration robustly predicted subsequent increases in HOMA-IR and fasting insulin but was unrelated to cognitive outcomes. In contrast, higher baseline NDE p-IRS1 predicted better global cognition (MMSE) over time, an effect strongest in younger participants, yet showed no association with peripheral metabolic change. Participants with concordantly low fasting insulin and C-peptide maintained roughly two-fold higher p-IRS1 than those in the highest tertiles, despite similar trajectories across visits. Neither peripheral nor central IR predicted telomere attrition. Cross-sectionally, p-IRS1 correlated inversely with SSPG concentration, BMI and leptin, suggesting compensatory brain–periphery coupling. These findings indicate that NDE-based markers capture a dimension of brain metabolic vulnerability distinct from classical peripheral measures.

Abstract: This study systematically reviews 99 research articles published over the past seven years, sourced from four reputable databases, to examine how indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is assessed and how energy data are integrated across various building types and climate zones. Five key IEQ assessment approaches emerged: subjective, objective, dual-method, weighting scheme, and computational model-aided methods. Although 41.4% of the articles included energy usage data, variations in monitoring duration, normalization techniques, and statistical rigor limited the ability to compare findings across studies. Tools like machine learning and IoT-enabled BIM show strong potential for real-time optimization of IEQ and energy performance, yet they remain underused. Thermal and lighting conditions were identified as the most energy-intensive IEQ dimensions, though results often varied due to climatic and methodological differences. In several cases, energy-saving interventions inadvertently compromised indoor air quality and thermal comfort, highlighting the need for integrated, precautionary strategies. Surprisingly, only 7.1% of articles involved post-assessment stakeholder engagement or follow-up interventions, exposing a gap between research and real-world impact. This study highlights the importance of critically evaluating performance metrics for contextual relevance and methodological soundness. To advance both occupant well-being and building energy performance globally, the field must embrace standardized assessment models, climate-responsive design, and well-rounded post-intervention evaluations.

Abstract: Iron deficiency anemia is a worldwide public health problem that urgently needs to be addressed. Current iron supplementation is restricted by instability, gastrointestinal tract irritation, and unpleasant organoleptic changes in foods. Herein, pH-responsive fibrils assembled by milk-derived peptide EQSLVCQCLV (EV-10, β-lactoglobulin 114–123) were employed to reduce, stabilize, and improve the bioavailability of iron nanoparticles (iron NPs). EV-10 fibril‑iron nanoparticle complexes (fibril‑iron NPs) are prepared by incubating FeCl3.6H2O with fibrils at pH 2.0 and 60 °C. The fibrils reduce 71 % of iron (III) ions in-situ without external reducing agents. This process produced iron NPs that were coordinated with -COO-, -NH2, and -SH groups on fibrils. The fibril‑iron NPs remain intact and protect iron NPs under simulated gastric digestion. However, they degrade to peptide‑iron NPs after being exposed to simulated intestine digestion. The in vitro (Caco-2 cells) iron bioavailability of Fibril‑iron NPs is 1.3-folds than that of FeSO4. And, the iron concentration of fibril‑iron NPs that required to improve HGB value in vivo (IDA rats) is half that of FeSO4, which without observable cytotoxicity or pathological histological changes. Compared with FeSO4, the fibril‑iron NPs have reduced the negative effects on the sensory attributes of yogurts and fruit teas by more than 30 %. The facile preparation procedure, excellent stability, and high bioavailability of fibril‑iron NPs suggest that they have considerable potential as iron supplements for foods.

Abstract: The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining host health and modulating disease progression. Microbiota-derived metabolites (MDMs) form a complex and diverse repertoire of molecules that interact uniquely with the host and regulate epigenetics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview by examining the current evidence on how MDMs reshape host epigenetic landscape, and we highlight the innovative concept of the “MDMs–epigenetic (MDME) axis” as a potential framework for exploring and understanding microbiota-host interactions. Next, we underscore the significance of the MDME axis in driving mechanistic studies and elucidating the underlying biological processes and pathophysiological pathways involved in various diseases. Finally, we discuss the impact of MDMs on epigenetic landscapes, outline future directions, and highlight their pivotal role in both mechanistic investigation and the development of clinical therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly recognized as complex disorders involving multiple protein pathologies, with α-synuclein frequently observed beyond classical synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy. Recent advances in seed amplification assays (SAAs) have enabled the highly sensitive and specific detection of misfolded α-synuclein in vivo, particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This review focuses on CSF-based α-synuclein SAAs and their application in detecting co-pathology across non-synucleinopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, and traumatic brain injury. Evidence indicates a role for α-synuclein in clinical heterogeneity and disease progression. Emerging diagnostic frameworks increasingly support integrating co-pathologies into classification and therapeutic strategies. Addressing key knowledge gaps, such as α-synuclein interactions with other protein pathologies, and current limitations of α-syn SAA, such as the lack of quantification of misfolded α-synuclein seeds, will refine precision medicine and improve outcomes for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Neurofilaments are key axonal proteins, with neurofilament light (NfL) and heavy (NfH) chain recognised as promising biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, neurofilament medium chain (NfM) remained previously underexplored due to a lack of quantitative assays. In this study, we developed a sensitive immunoassay to measure NfM in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and analysed its levels in ALS, Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Correlations among neurofilaments and their diagnostic performance were also evaluated.
Methods
In this study CSF levels of three neurofilament proteins were measured in 305 participants, including patients with ALS (n = 91), AD (n = 59), FTD (n = 38), LBD (n = 18), non-neurodegenerative controls (CTRL, n = 51), and 48 individuals initially evaluated for ALS but ultimately diagnosed with other conditions (CTRL.DD). NfM levels were quantified using a homemade sandwich ELISA, while NfL and NfH were measured using commercialised Ella cartridges.
Findings
All three neurofilaments were significantly elevated in ALS compared to CTRL and CTRL.DD groups (p < 0.0001 for both), with NfM and NfL also increased in FTD (p < 0.0001 for both) and AD (NfM, p < 0.0001; NfL, p = 0.0001) compared to CTRL. NfH demonstrated the greatest distinction between ALS and FTD (p < 0.0001). Strong correlations were observed among neurofilament subunits, particularly between NfM and NfL (r = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91–0.94, p < 0.0001). All neurofilaments effectively distinguished ALS from CTRL and CTRL.DD, with AUC values ranging from 0.92 to 0.99. NfM and NfL showed high accuracy in differentiating AD (NfM, AUC: 0.91; NfL, AUC: 0.89) and FTD (NfM, AUC: 0.91; NfL, AUC: 0.92) from CTRL, while NfH best separated ALS from FTD (AUC: 0.96).
Interpretation
This study provides a quantitative comparison of NfM with NfL and NfH in a neurodegenerative cohort, highlighting its potential diagnostic value. Further research with larger cohorts, longitudinal studies, and investigations into neurofilament distribution in different compartments is needed to clarify the distinct roles of NfM, NfL, and NfH in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases.

Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau pathology, and chronic neuroinflammation, leading to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Currently available treatments are liable to provide symptomatic relief; hence, researchers are focused on finding some novel molecular targets for developing targeted therapies, and also some biomarkers for early detection. Emerging evidence suggests that Galectin-3 (Gal-3) serves as a key regulator of microglial activation, exhibiting both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, depending on the stage of disease. The overexpression of Gal-3 leads to increased neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, accelerating disease progression while initially promoting Aβ clearance and suppressing immune response. Moreover, Gal-3 has been associated with tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, hence exacerbating synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damage. Elevated levels of Gal-3 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum correlate with disease severity, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Establishing Gal-3 inhibitors as a potential therapeutic target, several preclinical studies indicate their ability to lower Aβ and tau accumulation by regulating pro-inflammatory signaling and enhancing clearance mechanisms. This approach reduces neuroinflammation by suppressing microglial activation and improves cognitive function by preserving neuronal function and lowering oxidative stress. This review is intended to discuss the intricate role of Gal-3 in AD pathology, such as Aβ aggregation, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and microglial activation. Further, it explores the therapeutic strategies that Gal-3 could serve as a novel biomarker for tracing the disease, and reviews potential therapeutic approaches through Gal-3 inhibition for AD management.

Abstract: Wearable devices are widely adopted for monitoring motor symptoms in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), but optimal sensor placement remains under debate. This study compares kinematic data between a smartphone placement on the abdomen (patient-friendly) and a lumbar sensor (gold-standard) in individuals with and without PD. Five PD patients and five healthy controls wore inertial measurement units (IMUs) and consumer smart devices (smartwatch and smartphone) on their wrist and around their waist. Wrist sensors were utilised only to synchronise between the two sensor systems. The lumbar IMU and smartphone were placed at the level of the L5 vertebra and in the abdomen region, respectively. Data were collected during quiet stance with closed eyes and overground walking tasks. For both accelerometer and gyroscope signals, maximum spectral coherence was used to assess the frequency-domain correlation between the smartphone and the lumbar sensor while spectral gain measured their spatial coupling in the anteroposterior, mediolateral, and vertical planes within the 0.1–10 Hz frequency band. Analysis demonstrated a good to excellent inter-device agreement (coherence > 0.9) in both groups in most coordinates. However, coherence decreased (coherence < 0.9) for mediolateral acceleration and pitch rotation in walking. Sensor agreement was substantially lower in the quiet stance tasks particularly for anteroposterior acceleration and pitch rotation. These results were evident in both groups. Abdomen device placement provides clinically valid movement data for PD motor symptom monitoring. Yet, caution is advised for specific parameters, as abdominal movement may introduce noise, affecting measurement accuracy. This research contributes to identifying the patient-centric device positioning without compromising data, in both people with PD and healthy individuals.

Abstract: Microplastic (MP) pollution challenges marine ecosystems, with gastropods like Haliotis discus hannai being potentially vulnerable. However, the reversibility of MP-induced physiological damage in gastropods remains poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs; 0, 100, and 1000 μg/L) on H. discus hannai in a 14-day exposure followed by a 7-day recovery experimental design. The analysis focused on antioxidant status, energy metabolism, and immune pathways. Results showed dose-dependent oxidative stress during PS-MPs exposure, indicated by significantly (P < 0.05) elevated antioxidant enzyme activities (Superoxide dismutase, Catalase and Glutathione peroxidase), which decreased but did not normalize during recovery. Exposure to a low concentration of PS-MPs (100 μg/L) resulted in metabolic adjustments consistent with homeostatic maintenance, whereas a high concentration (1000 μg/L) significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase and Na+/K+-ATPase activities, suggesting metabolic disruption. These energy metabolism alterations persisted, showing incomplete recovery. Immune pathway analysis revealed minimal changes at low PS-MPs concentrations but significant enrichment of pathways like IL-17 and Fc-Epsilon-RI signaling at high concentrations during exposure. Notably, sustained activation of immune pathways, including NOD-like receptor, Toll-like receptor, and IL-17 signaling (particularly in the high-concentration group), persisted during recovery, potentially indicating prolonged cellular stress or links to apoptosis. Furthermore, Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) analysis confirmed that H. discus hannai remained severely impacted even after the recovery period. This study provides crucial evidence on the complex toxicodynamics of PS-MPs in H. discus hannai, highlighting incomplete physiological recovery and significant damage during the recovery period following exposure, especially at high concentrations.

Abstract: Short-chained chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) are a class of polychlorinated n-alkanes containing 10–13 carbon atoms, which are widely used in several industrial sectors due to their excellent thermal and chemical stability. However, their persistent residues, semi-volatility, and ubiquity in environmental media have raised global concerns. SCCPs are recognized as important environmental pollutants and are listed under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants due to their persistence, bioaccumulation, ability to be transported over long distances, and biotoxicity. Despite international restrictions, some developing countries continue to produce and use SCCPs. SCCPs have recently been found to be widely present in human blood, hair, and even in serum samples and umbilical cords of pregnant women. Exposure to SCCPs can lead to metabolic disorder and organ damage, including liver and kidney toxicity, and an increased risk of cancer. Epidemiologic studies have shown a positive correlation between serum levels of SCCPs and biomarkers of certain diseases, suggesting that SCCPs are potentially hazardous to health. Given the global public health implications of chronic exposure to SCCPs, a comprehensive health risk assessment is essential for effective control of health hazards. This review discusses the exposure routes, human accumulation, and mechanisms of toxicity of SCCPs, with a focus on neurologic, thyroid, hepatic, renal, and reproductive toxicity. In particular, the effects of SCCPs on metabolic disorders and signaling pathway perturbations are summarized, as well as the risk of exposure to SCCPs in human samples. Finally, we also look forward to the future direction of SCCPs toxicology research. It is recommended to focus on human exposomics to identify exposure biomarkers, integrate computational toxicology with organoid technologies, and provide scientific basis for SCCPs risk early warning and global management of persistent organic pollutants.

Abstract: Flexible pressure sensors face an irreconcilable trade-off among linearity, sensitivity, and signal stability due to viscoelastic creep. Inspired by the gradient modulus characteristics of human skin, this study employs electrospinning to construct a heterogeneous structure composed of a high-modulus nanofiber network embedded in a low-modulus ionic gel. This structure mimics epidermal rigidity (high-modulus nanofiber layer), dermal viscoelasticity (fiber-gel hybrid), and hypodermal compliance (soft ionic matrix) to synergistically redistribute stress and suppress ion migration. The sensor achieves breakthrough performance: a wide linear range (1 MPa) with near-perfect linearity (R2 = 0.999) and ultrahigh sensitivity (81.3 kPa−1), yielding a record linear sensing factor (LSF, 81,300). Simultaneously, it exhibits ultralow creep (1.76 % signal drift under sustained loading)—96.8 % lower than non-structured iongels—enabled by nanofiber-restricted ion pathways. Theoretical modeling reveals a dynamic compensation mechanism where pressure-induced changes in dielectric properties, contact area expansion, and electric double-layer thinning interact linearly. Laboratory validation demonstrates high-fidelity plantar pressure monitoring during gait cycles and machine learning-based prediction of vertical ground reaction forces with exceptional accuracy (R2 > 0.95). This work establishes a new design paradigm for high-precision flexible sensing by fundamentally resolving long-standing material limitations.

Abstract: Background
Lavender, belongs to the genus Lavandula of the Lamiaceae family, is a "medicinal and edible homologous" plant with medicinal and economic value, widely cultivated worldwide. Traditionally used for relieving emotions, sedation, and hypnosis, modern research has long focused on the chemical composition and pharmacological activity of its essential oil. However, the exploration of non-volatile components and utilization of by-products remains insufficient, lacking a systematic integration of interdisciplinary research.
Purpose
This review systematically identifies recent research on lavender in terms of phytochemistry, pharmacological mechanisms, cross-field applications (medicine, daily chemicals, agriculture), clinical applications, and safety evaluation. It identifies the limitations of previous studies, which prioritized essential oils over the whole plant and focused on basic research over transformation, to provide theoretical support for its scientific application and further development.
Methods
A comprehensive search of literatures on lavender or Lavandula, its active ingredients, pharmacological activities, clinical trials, and safety published before April 2025 was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China Knowledge Network.

Active components of lavender include volatile components (mainly essential oils, with linalool and linalyl acetate as core components) and non-volatile components (flavonoids, phenolic acids, coumarins, triterpenoids). Lavender has a wide range of pharmacological effects, involving central regulation (anxiolytic, antidepressant), antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and cardiovascular disease treatment. Moreover, utilization potential of the whole plant (roots, stems, leaves) and processed solid residues is being gradually explored. In addition to applications in the field of traditional medicine, lavender also shows application prospects in the field of materials science (e.g., antibacterial coatings) and high-value by-product utilization (e.g., feed additives). Clinical studies confirmed that Silexan™, with lavender essential oil (LEO) as the core component, is safe and effective for treating anxiety and related diseases. Furthermore, safety studies on lavender extracts and their main components show good safety under research conditions.
Conclusion
This review highlights the value of lavender beyond essential oils, with its other active components and cross-disciplinary applications warranting attention. Lavender-based products (e.g., essential oils) show potential in relieving anxiety and improving sleep; standardized products are preferred for daily use to ensure efficacy and safety. However, future basic research should focus on pharmacological potential of non-volatile components, explore core targets and signaling pathways of active ingredients, and pursue interdisciplinary collaborations (e.g., material science for new delivery systems), which are crucial for tapping into its therapeutic and industrial value. Given clear efficacy of lavender (especially Silexan™) in anxiety and depressive disorders, it can be a safe alternative to traditional medications. However, further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of Silexan™ and its relative effectiveness compared with standard drugs, and clarify its exact mechanism at the molecular and cellular levels that enable more targeted therapies.

Abstract: Phenolic plant metabolites, including hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, homovanillic alcohol, and their acetate derivatives, have emerged as potent antioxidants and promising therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. These compounds exhibit dual functionality by efficiently scavenging reactive free radicals and targeting key protein residues, thereby alleviating oxidative stress and preventing cellular damage. Using multiscale in silico methodologies, their interactions with peroxyl (ROO•) and hydroperoxyl (HOO•) radicals, as well as with Monoamine Oxidase A (MAO-A), a pivotal enzyme in Parkinson's disease, were systematically investigated. Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses illustrate radical stabilization pathways, supported by MEP, SD, NBO, FMO, and Fukui function descriptors. Hirshfeld surface analysis (HSA) and QTAIM further reveal strong binding hotspots, predominantly stabilized by conventional hydrogen bonding complemented with hydrophobic non-covalent contacts. ADMET profiling underscored favorable pharmacokinetic properties and drug-likeness. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed their stable accommodation within the MAO-A catalytic pocket, highlighting significant binding affinities and critical interacting residues. Overall, these findings establish hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and homovanillic alcohol derivatives as potential multifunctional neuroprotective agents against Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Selective autophagy is the process by which specific cellular components are degraded through cargo receptors that recognize target molecules for lysosomal degradation. Among these pathways, glycophagy is a form of ubiquitin-independent selective autophagy that specifically targets glycogen for degradation. In this review, we discuss the molecular components involved in glycophagy, with a particular focus on starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 (STBD1), which functions as a selective autophagy receptor by recognizing glycogen and facilitating its recruitment to autophagosomes. We also examine the physiological and pathological roles of glycophagy, as well as potential therapeutic strategies for targeting this pathway in disease. Finally, we highlight outstanding questions and future directions in this emerging field.

Abstract: Extracellular accumulation of adenosine (ADO) is a central mechanism of immune evasion within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Elevated ADO levels—driven by hypoxia, chronic inflammation, and upregulated ectonucleotidase activity, primarily through CD39 and CD73—induce profound immunosuppression and promote tumor progression. In this setting, adenosine acts mainly through two G protein–coupled receptors, A2A (A2AAR) and A2B (A2BAR), which modulate diverse immune and stromal cell populations. A2AAR signaling suppresses the effector activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, whereas A2BAR activation exerts broader effects by amplifying myeloid-derived immunosuppression, driving stromal remodeling, and fostering angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the distinct and converging roles of A2AAR and A2BAR in immune, stromal, and tumor compartments. We critically analyze current strategies for developing selective and dual A2AAR/A2BAR antagonists, with a focus on structure–activity relationships, scaffold optimization, and pharmacokinetic profiling. In addition, we examine ongoing clinical trials and emerging combination therapies involving A2AAR and A2BAR antagonists in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell therapies, enzymatic axis blockade, radiotherapy, and classical chemotherapy. We also underscore the therapeutic potential of dual A2AAR/A2BAR antagonists as a multi-target approach to counteract overlapping immunosuppressive mechanisms. Overall, targeting the adenosine axis—particularly through dual receptor blockade—represents a promising strategy to reprogram the TME, reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity, and improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract: Constipation, a common gastrointestinal system disease, has a variety of side effects, but its pathogenesis is diverse and complex. Thus, its treatment is affected by a variety of factors, such as intestinal flora imbalance, nervous system problems (cerebrovascular disease, cognitive impairment or dementia, Parkinson’s disease) and other pathological diseases (hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia and others). With the rise of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis theory, people's understanding and treatment methods for gastrointestinal diseases such as constipation have also undergone significant changes. Therefore, this paper focuses on the MGB axis and constipation, including the 3 main regulatory pathways of this axis, the gut microbial metabolites and the regulation of neurotransmitters, and the methods and applications of treating constipation and other diseases on the basis of this axis. Further clarification of the pathways and influencing factors related to the MGB axis will help elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of constipation and play a key role in the rational treatment of human gastrointestinal diseases.

Abstract: Objectives
This study aims to disentangle the age and cohort effects on depressive symptoms among middle-aged and older adults, while accounting for the role of multimorbidity across nine European countries.
Methods
Using longitudinal data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (2004–2022), with participants aged 50–89 and birth cohorts from 1921 to 1970, we employed Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort (HAPC)-Growth Curve models to estimate age and cohort effects on depressive symptoms. Interaction effects of multimorbidity and country with cohort and age were also tested. Bounding analysis was used as a robustness check.
Results
The age effect revealed a U-shaped trajectory of depressive symptoms, with a decline after age 50, reaching a low point around age 65, followed by a sharp increase after age 70. The cohort effect showed that later-born cohorts experienced higher levels of depression. Bounding analysis confirmed these findings: period effects were near zero, with the exception of Spain. Multimorbidity was positively associated with depression, with significant national differences. Younger cohorts with multimorbidity status in Scandinavian countries show elevated depressive symptoms. For Spain, depressive symptoms are concentrated among earlier-born cohorts. Central European countries showed variability, but Germany's depression trajectory remained stable, with cohort effects being most pronounced.
Discussion
Our findings emphasize the need for a life-course perspective to understand depression trajectories. Cohort differences highlight the role of sociohistorical contexts, while multimorbidity requires attention in long-term healthcare policy.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the substantial degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, and the intraneuronal formation of Lewy bodies. DJ-1 is a multifaceted protein that has been linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent research has highlighted a potential role for DJ-1 in PD. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, modulating apoptosis, facilitating chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and stabilizing dopamine levels by interacting with various signaling pathways, transcription factors, and molecular chaperones. The potential of DJ-1 as a therapeutic target for PD is apparent. In this review, we delineate the specific contributions of DJ-1 to the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic developments centered on DJ-1 in the context of neurodegeneration associated with PD.

Abstract: The analysis of medical time series, such as Electrocardiography (ECG) and Electroencephalography (EEG), is fundamental to clinical diagnostics and patient monitoring. Accurate and automated classification of these signals can facilitate early disease detection and personalized treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes. Although deep learning models are widely adopted, they mainly process signals as sequential numerical data. Such a single-modality approach often misses the holistic visual patterns easily recognized by clinicians from graphical charts and struggles to model the complex non-linear dynamics of physiological data. As a result, the rich diagnostic cues contained in visual representations remain largely untapped, limiting model performance. To address these limitations, we propose MedViA, a novel multimodal learning framework that empowers Medical time series classification by integrating both Vision Augmentation and numeric perception. Our core innovation is to augment the raw medical time series signals into the visual modality, enabling a dual-pathway architecture that computationally mimics the comprehensive reasoning of clinical experts. With the augmentation, MedViA then features two parallel perception branches: a Visual Perception Module, built upon a novel Multi-resolution Differential Vision Transformer, processes the augmented images to capture high-level structural patterns and diagnostically critical waveform morphologies. Concurrently, a Numeric Perception Module, which uses our proposed Temporal Kolmogorov Network to model fine-grained and non-linear dynamics directly from the raw time series. To synergistically integrate the insights from these dedicated pathways, we introduce a Medically-informed Hierarchical Multimodal Fusion strategy, which uses a late-fusion architecture and a hierarchical optimization objective to derive for the final classification. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple public medical time series datasets, which demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Curcuma species belonging to the Zingiberaceae family has been widely known for its beneficial effects on human health. Three species of Curcuma, Curcuma longa L., Curcuma xanthorrhiza, and Curcuma manga, have been utilized because of their biological and pharmacological activities. Different origins truly affected the metabolite compositions of Curcuma species, thus affecting the biological effects. This research aimed to apply a non-targeted metabolomics approach utilizing liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) incorporated with chemometrics of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for identification of global metabolomics profiles and discrimination of C. longa L., C. xanthorrhiza, and C. manga from different origins. Species and origin-based variations in metabolite composition were clearly visualized through PCA and PLS-DA score plots. Key discriminating metabolites, such as curcumin and (+)-nootkatone, were identified using variable importance in projection (VIP) values, confirming their role in distinguishing among species and origins. These findings suggest that environmental factors significantly influence the metabolic profiles of Curcuma species. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of LC-HRMS-based non-targeted metabolomics combined with chemometric analysis as a reliable tool for the authentication, classification, and quality control of Curcuma species, supporting their safe and standardized use in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.

Abstract: Background & Aims
Gastroparesis is a complex gastric motility disorder characterized by nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms associated with a delay in gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Variations in diagnostic testing and limited effective treatments make caring for this patient population challenging. The American Gastroenterological Association developed this guideline to provide recommendations for ensuring an accurate diagnosis and identifying evidence-based, effective treatments among the available pharmacologic and procedural interventions for patients with idiopathic gastroparesis or gastroparesis related to diabetes.
Methods
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and develop this guideline. The Guideline Panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes, conducted an evidence review, and used the Evidence to Decision Framework to develop recommendations.
Results
The Guideline Panel agreed on 12 recommendations. A conditional recommendation was issued against using 2-hour gastric emptying testing and in favor of 4-hour testing in patients with suspected gastroparesis. There are conditional recommendations for the use of metoclopramide and erythromycin in patients with gastroparesis. Conditional recommendations were issued against the use of domperidone, prucalopride, aprepitant, nortriptyline, buspirone, and cannabidiol as first-line therapies. In addition, conditional recommendations were issued against the routine initial use of gastric per-oral endoscopic pyloromyotomy or gastric electrical stimulation in patients with gastroparesis, reserving these treatments for select patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapies. No recommendation was given regarding the use of surgical pyloromyotomy and surgical pyloroplasty, which were identified as procedures with knowledge gaps in their use for treatment for gastroparesis.
Conclusions
The diagnosis of gastroparesis requires the use of 4-hour gastric emptying tests. Metoclopramide or erythromycin is appropriate for initial pharmacologic treatment. Other treatment recommendations require shared patient-physician decision making. There are still considerable unmet needs in the treatment of gastroparesis.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
A series of biologically active phenothiazine derivatives were studied as inhibitors of the free‐radical chain oxidation of isopropyl alcohol by atmospheric oxygen. It was found that these compounds exhibit antioxidant properties, effectively suppressing the oxidation process. The key rate constants quantitatively characterizing the efficiency of their antioxidant action were determined. Mathematical modeling was used to analyze the proposed oxidation mechanism, identifying the critical stages that determine the inhibitory efficacy of phenothiazines. It was shown that the inhibitor regeneration reaction plays a significant role, leading to a high inhibition capacity. The application of mathematical modeling allowed the proposal of an oxidation mechanism that provides a comprehensive explanation for all currently available experimental and literature data.

Abstract: Fu's subcutaneous needling (FSN) represents a non-pharmacological therapy that employs disposable needles for subcutaneous application, primarily targeting the relaxation of tightened muscles, invigoration of blood circulation, and alleviation of local tissue ischemia. Originating from traditional acupuncture and modern techniques, FSN effectively treats muscle-related conditions, including soft tissue injuries, neck-shoulder-back pain, visceral pain, and non-painful diseases. Its unique features encompass shallow needling, the swaying movement technique, and an emphasis on governing the spirit. FSN is characterized by rapid therapeutic responses, high repeatability, and minimal side effects, adhering to the keep it simple, stupid (KISS) principle in research by emphasizing simplicity and efficacy. By mechanically releasing chronic muscle tension, FSN improves arterial blood flow, halts pathological leakage of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and consequently resolves pain. This therapy offers a promising and safe approach for pain management and muscular health, deserving vigorous promotion and further scientific investigation.

Abstract: Hesperidin is a flavonoid renowned for its significant pharmacological effects and promising therapeutic potential. It is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom and is a common constituent of our daily diets, primarily in fruits and vegetables. Several cellular and animal models have been developed to evaluate the underlying neuropharmacological mechanisms of hesperidin. Additionally, clinical evidence has also confirmed itsneuroprotectivefunction. Hesperidin exerts neuroprotective properties by attenuating neuroinflammatory, apoptotic pathways, and oxidative stress. Beyond its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory attributes, it also hampers the formation of amyloid-β protein fibrils, modulates its expression, promotes the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzyme, decreases glutamate excitotoxicity, improves neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, via targeting several cellular and molecular targets and pathways. This review aims to provide an overview of recent literature exploring the association between Hesperidin and Alzheimer’s disease, along with its potential as a primary candidate in clinical applications.

Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver tumor in dogs. MicroRNA (miRNA) dysregulation and its clinical significance have been reported in dog and human cancers, including HCC. However, determining the whole miRNA transcriptomic profile is essential for diagnosis and therapeutics. Here, we determined the miRNA transcriptomic profile of canine HCC. First, miRNA expression from three control liver tissues and three canine HCC patients was analyzed via small RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS). After analyzing the sequencing reads, differential miRNA (DEmiRNA) expression was further confirmed in the clinical samples and three HCC cell lines via qRT-PCR. The functional pathways of the DEmiRNAs were analyzed from an experimentally validated human miRNA-target database. Our study revealed 20 upregulated and nine downregulated miRNAs. Among them, 10 miRNAs were further validated by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR and NGS revealed similar miRNA expression patterns. Furthermore, we investigated the signaling pathways based on the KEGG pathway analysis and performed a functional analysis of the dysregulated miRNAs in canine HCC. The upregulated miRNAs mainly play a role in the p53 and cell cycle pathways and function in DNA damage repair and differentiation. In contrast, the downregulated miRNAs are involved in cancer and cell cycle pathways and mainly function in cell differentiation. Further, these miRNAs may be investigated in light of miRNA-based diagnosis and therapies.
