Abstract: Introduction
The relationship between mobility and cognition has been studied in the aging population and associations have been also reported in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).
Objective
To compare different aspects of gait and balance between individuals with PD who have normal cognition and those with impaired cognition, using both clinical and instrumented measures.
Methods
One-hundred forty-three participants with PD were divided into two groups: 1) normal cognition (n = 71) and 2) impaired cognition (n = 72) based on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cut-off. Groups were compared using instrumented and clinical measures of gait and balance in the following domains: Sensory Orientation, Anticipatory Postural Adjustments, Automatic Postural Responses and Dynamic Balance for Gait. Instrumented measures were obtained via wearable sensors while performing eight different motor tasks and clinical measures were obtained with the Mini-BESTest.
Results
The total Mini-BESTest score was not different between groups. However, the Dynamic Gait domain was worse in individuals with impaired cognition. Among the instrumented measures across domains, all significant group differences were in the Dynamic Gait domain, specifically, dual-task gait speed, dual-task stride length, stance time, and turn velocity.
Conclusions
Dynamic balance during gait was more impaired in people with PD who had abnormal cognition than those with normal cognition, for both clinical and instrumented measures. All other balance domains did not differ between groups, for both instrumented and clinical measures.

Abstract: Background
Timely detection of neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions is crucial for early intervention. Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in children and Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in speech disturbances that may be exploited for diagnostic screening using recorded speech signals. We were motivated to develop an accurate yet computationally lightweight model for speech-based detection of SLI and PD, employing novel feature engineering techniques to mimic the adaptable dynamic weight assignment network capability of deep learning architectures.
Materials and methods
In this research, we have introduced an advanced feature engineering model incorporating a novel feature extraction function, the Factor Lattice Pattern (FLP), which is a quantum-inspired method and uses a superposition-like mechanism, making it dynamic in nature. The FLP encompasses eight distinct patterns, from which the most appropriate pattern was discerned based on the data structure. Through the implementation of the FLP, we automatically extracted signal-specific textural features. Additionally, we developed a new feature engineering model to assess the efficacy of the FLP. This model is self-organizing, producing nine potential results and subsequently choosing the optimal one. Our speech classification framework consists of (1) feature extraction using the proposed FLP and a statistical feature extractor; (2) feature selection employing iterative neighborhood component analysis and an intersection-based feature selector; (3) classification via support vector machine and k-nearest neighbors; and (4) outcome determination using combinational majority voting to select the most favorable results.
Results
To validate the classification capabilities of our proposed feature engineering model, designed to automatically detect PD and SLI, we employed three speech datasets of PD and SLI patients. Our presented FLP-centric model achieved classification accuracy of more than 95% and 99.79% for all PD and SLI datasets, respectively.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that the proposed model is an accurate alternative to deep learning models in classifying neurological conditions using speech signals.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex condition that affects an individual’s motor features and intensifies over time. Symptoms vary between individuals and can go undetected at an early stage. Voice data has shown potential in predicting PD. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has made significant progress, with ensemble ML approaches proving to be effective in various applications. This research aims to detect PD at an early stage using ensemble techniques on the Parkinson’s speech dataset (PSV), which contains several sound recordings with 27 input features and one target feature. Feature importance was computed using Mean Decrease in Impurity (F-MDI), Feature Permutation (F-PER), and Pearson’s Correlation (F-CORR) techniques. Several supervised ML baseline models were compared with the proposed Nearest Neighbor Boosting (NNB) technique, which combines k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Gradient Boosting (GB). The NNB technique outperformed the baseline models for multiple performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, F-score, the area under the curve (AUC), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and confusion matrix (CM). The findings suggest that the designed ensemble method can be a promising method for PD detection.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a serious neurological disease. Many studies have preseted regions of interest such as substantia nigra (SN) for PD detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the SN is not the only region with remarkable tissue changes in PD MRIs. Patients with Prodromal Parkinson’s Disease usually present with non-motor symptoms, and the associated brain regions may show varying degrees of damage on imaging. Therefore, exploring PD-related regions from whole-brain MRI is essential. In this study, we proposed an interpretable PD detection framework, including PD classification and feature region visualization. Specifically, we constructed a 3D ResNet model that could detect PD from whole-brain MRIs and discover other brain regions related to PD through 3D Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). We obtained T1-Weighted MRIs from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. The average classification accuracy of the 5-fold cross-validation and held-out dataset reached 96.1% and 94.5%, respectively. In addition, we used the 3D Grad-CAM framework to extract the weight of the feature map and obtain visual interpretation. The heat map highlighted the regions that were crucial for PD classification and found significant differences between PD and HC in frontal lobe related to linguistic semantic disorders. The UPDRS scores of PD and HC on the linguistic semantic function items were also remarkably different. Combined with previous studies, this work verified the significance of the frontal lobe and proved that the correlation between the frontal lobe and the pathogenesis of PD was explanatory.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is manifested with disrupted topology of the structural connection network (SCN) and the functional connection network (FCN). However, the SCN and its interactions with the FCN remain to be further investigated. This multimodality study attempted to precisely characterize the SCN using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and further identify the neuropathological pattern of SCN-FCN decoupling, underscoring the neurodegeneration of PD. Diffusion-weighted imaging and resting-state functional imaging were available for network constructions among sixty-nine patients with PD and seventy demographically matched healthy control (HC) participants. The classification performance and topological prosperities of both the SCN and the FCN were analyzed, followed by quantification of the SCN-FCN couplings across scales. The SCN constructed by kurtosis metrics achieved optimal classification performance (area under the curve 0.89, accuracy 80.55 %, sensitivity 78.40 %, and specificity 80.65 %). Along with diverse alterations of structural and functional network topology, the PD group exhibited decoupling across scales including: reduced global coupling; increased nodal coupling within the sensorimotor network (SMN) and subcortical network (SN); higher intramodular coupling within the SMN and SN and lower intramodular coupling of the default mode network (DMN); decreased coupling between the modules of DMN-fronto-parietal network and DMN-visual network, but increased coupling between the SMN-SN module. Several associations between the coupling coefficient and topological properties of the SCN, as well as between network values and clinical scores, were observed. These findings validated the clinical implementation of DKI for structural network construction with better differentiation ability and characterized the SCN-FCN decoupling as supplementary insight into the pathological process underlying PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease, the development, and progression of which are influenced by multiple factors, including the genetic markups and the environment. Nutrition is considered one of the most robust environmental factors affecting PD as it can either induce or reduce disease susceptibility. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) activity. Accumulating evidence from nutriepigenomics studies has reported altered epigenetic mechanisms in clinical and preclinical PD models and the potential role of nutrition in modifying the changes. In addition, through nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics studies, the diet-gene, and gene-diet interactions in relation to PD development and progression have been investigated. Herein, current findings on the roles of nutrition in epigenetic mechanisms underpinning PD development and progression are discussed. Besides, the potential of the personalized nutrition approach as adjuvant therapy for PD are also underlined.

Abstract: Objective
It is unclear whether β-asarone has a good antidepressant effect and what is the main mechanism in Depression in Parkinson’s disease (DPD) model rats.
Methods
In this study, DPD model rats were screened from 6-OHDA induced rats by sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swimming test (FST). DPD model rats were divided into eight groups: model group, pramipexole group, β-asarone low-dose group (β-asarone 7.5 group), β-asarone medium-dose group (β-asarone 15 group), β-asarone high-dose group (β-asarone 30 group), 3-MA group, rapamycin group, and PI3K inhibitor group. 28 days after the end of treatment, open field test (OFT), SPT and FST were conducted in rats. The level of α-synuclein (α-syn) in the striatum was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of Beclin-1, p62 in the striatum was determined by western blot. The expression of PI3K, p-PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, mTOR, p-mTOR, Beclin-1, and p62 in the hippocampus was determined by western blot. The spine density of neurons in the hippocampus was detected by golgi staining.
Results
The results showed that 4-week oral administration of β-asarone improve the motor and depressive symptoms of DPD model rats, and decrease the content of α-syn in the striatum. β-asarone inhibited the expression of autophagy in the striatum of DPD model rats. Furthermore, β-asarone decreased the levels of Beclin-1 protein, increased the expression of p62, p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR, and improved the density of neuron dendritic spine in the hippocampus.
Conclusions
We concluded that β-asarone might improve the behavior of DPD model rats by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, inhibiting autophagy and protecting neuron.

Abstract: Background
Due to the rapid increase in aging population, there has been a rise in cases of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), which is a major challenge for human health. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are common degenerative disorders with complex causes and limited treatment options. The brain-gut axis is an important pathway that facilitates communication between the brain and gut. It involves intricate interactions among various systems such as nervous, immune, and endocrine systems. Recent evidence suggests a strong connection between gut microbiota and central nervous system (CNS) diseases.
Scope and approach
The involvement of polysaccharides in AD and PD holds promise as a potential avenue for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review aims to comprehensively investigate the impact of polysaccharides derived from food on NDs through the brain-gut axis, and explore the preclinical therapeutic effects of representative polysaccharides on NDs.
Key findings and conclusions
Our objective is to investigate the metabolic processes of polysaccharides in the gastrointestinal tract, examine their interactions with intestinal microbes, and comprehend how these processes influence the nervous system through the brain-gut axis. Furthermore, we aim to analyze the degradation process of polysaccharides in the gut, elucidate their regulatory mechanisms on microflora, provide evidence supporting their potential therapeutic applications for NDs, and emphasize clinical research data related to polysaccharides in CNS disorders. This review presents compelling evidence that gut microbiota serve as crucial regulators of naturally occurring polysaccharides while offering novel insights into utilizing various structural types of polysaccharides for addressing NDs.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based model developed to accurately classify Parkinson's disease patients using 3D MRI scans and data augmentation techniques. The study aimed to address the research question of whether this approach could effectively detect structural changes indicative of Parkinson's disease and enhance diagnostic accuracy. The model utilized 3D brain MRI scans from the midbrain region and leveraged the domain of data augmentation to expand the dataset and improve generalizability. The testing accuracy of the model was evaluated with and without data augmentation to further understand it's applicability. The paper demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying Parkinson's disease patients from healthy controls, achieving a testing accuracy of up to 90.13% with data augmentation. The incorporation of data augmentation led to a significant 15.53% increase in accuracy compared to the model without augmentation. The utilization of 3D MRI scans allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of structural changes associated with the disease, and it is intuitive to believe that shuch efficient predictions can facilitate earlier treatment and better patient outcomes.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, is pathologically characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Current therapeutic strategies primarily alleviate clinical symptoms but lack efficacy in halting or reversing neurodegeneration. Recent studies have highlighted the FGF21-ACE2 signaling axis—a synergistic interaction between fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—as an emerging therapeutic target in PD due to its tripartite roles in neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory modulation, and metabolic homeostasis. Mechanistically, FGF21 activates neuroprotective pathways including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, suppressing apoptotic cascades, amplifying antioxidant defenses, and stimulating dopaminergic neuron differentiation. Conversely, ACE2 counterbalances neurotoxicity by converting angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], thereby mitigating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Their coordinated activity potently inhibits M1 microglial activation, downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α), and bolsters astrocytic antioxidant responses while preserving metabolic equilibrium. Notably, this axis ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction and attenuates α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregationvia modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling networks, collectively decelerating PD pathogenesis. Therapeutic interventions such as small-molecule agonists (e.g., diminazene aceturate, DIZE) and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing show potential to upregulate FGF21-ACE2 activity, while non-pharmacological approaches including exercise and ketogenic diets may synergistically enhance pathway efficacy. However, translational hurdles persist, including limited blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of therapeutics, off-target effects, and insufficient clinical validation. Future directions should prioritize deciphering dynamic molecular crosstalk within this pathway, engineering BBB-penetrant nanocarriers for targeted delivery, and conducting large-scale randomized controlled trials. This review underscores the FGF21-ACE2 axis as a multi-mechanistic therapeutic paradigm for PD, with its capacity for simultaneous modulation of neurodegeneration, inflammation, and metabolism positioning it as a superior candidate to conventional single-target therapies in achieving disease modification.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second prevalent neurological diseases with a significant growth rate in incidence. Convolutional neural networks using structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI) are widely used for PD classification. However, the areas of change in the patient's MRI images are small and unfixed. Thus, capturing the features of the areas accurately where the lesions changed became a problem.
Method
We propose a deep learning framework that combines multi-scale attention guidance and multi-branch feature processing modules to diagnose PD by learning sMRI T2 slice features. In this scheme, firstly, to achieve effective feature transfer and gradient descent, a deep convolutional neural network framework based on dense block is designed. Next, an Adaptive Weighted Attention algorithm is proposed, whose pursers is to extract multi branch and even diverse features. Finally, Dropout layer and SoftMax layer are added to the network structure to obtain good classification results and rich and diverse feature information. The Dropout layer is used to reduce the number of intermediate features to increase the orthogonality between features of each layer. The activation function SoftMax increases the flexibility of the neural network by increasing the degree of fitting to the training set and converting linear to nonlinear.
Results
The best performance of the proposed method an accuracy of 92%, a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 90% and a F1 score of 95% respectively for identifying PD and HC.
Conclusion
Experiments show that the proposed method can successfully distinguish PD and NC. Good classification results were obtained in PD diagnosis classification task and compared with advanced research methods.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a nervous system abnormality marked by decreased dopamine levels in the brain. Parkinson's disease inhibits one's ability to move. Speech difficulty, changes in movement and handwriting, and other symptoms are common with Parkinson's disease. A collection of hand drawings is employed to predict Parkinson's disease. There are 102 spiral images in the hand drawing dataset. Due to the minimal size of the dataset, augmentation is utilized to increase it. After that, the augmented images are utilized to train several machine learning and deep learning models, as well as pre-trained networks like RESNET50, VGG16, AlexNet, and VGG19. The performance metrics of hybrid models of deep learning with machine learning and hybrid models of deep learning (for feature extraction) with deep learning (for classification) are then compared. It was observed that the hybrid model of RESNET-50 and SVM performed well with better performance measures compared to other Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Hybrid Models with an accuracy score of 98.45%, sensitivity score of 0.99 and specificity score of 0.98.

Abstract: Background
Information on determinants of patient-reported functional mobility is lacking but would inform the planning of healthcare, resources and strategies to promote functional mobility in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Research question
To identify the determinants of patient-reported functional mobility of people with PD.
Methods
Eligible: Randomized Controlled Trials, cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional analyses in people PD without date or setting restrictions, published in English, German, or French. Excluded: instruments with under 50 % of items measuring mobility. On August 9th 2023 we last searched Medline, CINAHL and PsychInfo. We assessed risk of bias using the mixed-methods appraisal tool. Results were synthesized by tabulating the determinants by outcomes and study designs.
Results
Eleven studies published 2012–2023 were included (most in Swedish outpatient settings). Samples ranged from 9 to 255 participants. Follow-up varied from 1.5 to 36 months with attrition of 15–42 %. Heterogenic study designs complicated results synthesis. However, determinants related to environment seem to associate the strongest with patient-reported functional mobility, although determinants related to body structures and functions were most investigated. We identified disease duration, the ability to drive, caregiving, sex, age, cognitive impairment, postural instability and social participation as determinants of patient-reported functional mobility.
Discussion
Methodological quality of the studies was limited. No study reported an a priori power calculation. Three studies controlled for confounders. The included studies lack representativeness of the population of people living with PD. Standardized sets of outcomes could enable more systematic research synthesis.
Conclusions
Future research should focus on activities, participation and environmental factors and improve methodological quality.

Abstract: Background and Objective
Clinical scales used by well-trained clinicians to assess motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) allow to establish the patients’ medical therapy and follow-up their response. However, these assessments are subjective and their application to patients requires experienced and qualified operators. This study analyzes the role of the kinematic patient’s features, captured by a simple computer keyboard paradigm, in predicting the scores prescribed by an experienced neurologist.
Methods
A total of 47 patients in their ON medication state participated in this study. Their motor capacity was assessed by an experienced neurologist with several standardized clinical scales. The patients also performed 5 consecutive trials of 10 s of a computerized finger tapping task by pressing with their index the space bar, first with their dominant hand and then with the other hand. 270 tapping-related features were extracted from the tapping task data for each participant and linear regression multivariate models for each clinical variable were built by using these features.
Results
The best resulting models were for the motor capacity (Unified Parkisnon Disase Scale Revised – MDS-UPDRS Part III), years from disease onset and balance scores (Limit of Stability – LoS), with root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.268, 0.254 and 0.150, respectively, all bellow their corresponding minimal clinically important differences. Those models included variables from both hands and from all trials, mainly regarding slow and fast tapping-related variables in different degrees.
Conclusions
A simple bimanual non-alternating finger tapping task has shown to foresee motor capacity and balance scores by using statistical and machine learning methods. This easy and quick task could be performed periodically in the medical office or at home helping the clinician to know the patients’ motor state and temporary alterations in that way and to make finer clinical decisions about the proper pharmacological treatment of every patient.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder that belongs to a class of neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) called Synucleinopathies. It has characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of a-synuclein. Our understanding of PD continues to evolve, and so does our approach to treatment. including therapies aimed at delaying pathology, quitting neuronal loss, and shortening the course of the disease by selectively targeting essential proteins suspected to play a role in PD pathogenesis. One emerging approach that is generating significant interest is Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD). TPD is an innovative method that allows us to specifically break down certain proteins using specially designed molecules or peptides, like PROteolysis-TArgeting-Chimera (PROTACs). This approach holds great promise, particularly in the context of NDs. In this review, we will briefly explain PD and its pathogenesis, followed by discussing protein degradation systems and TPD strategy in PD by reviewing synthesized small molecules and peptides. Finally, future perspectives and challenges in the field are discussed.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD)-induced motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment are becoming increasingly common due to global population aging. However, efficient treatment strategies for these conditions are still lacking. Recent studies indicated that neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis could greatly worsen the symptoms of PD. Therefore, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory drugs could be useful in the management of PD. In the present study, minocycline (MIN)-loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4-MIN NPs) were prepared for the targeted treatment of PD. Owing to their near-infrared (NIR) irradiation-induced photothermal effects, the Fe3O4-MIN NPs could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus enhancing the delivery of Fe3O4-MIN NPs to the brain parenchyma. Subsequently, the Fe3O4-MIN NPs exerted strong anti-inflammatory effects and alleviated neuroinflammation in the brain. Furthermore, they exerted anti-oxidative effects, scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species in the brain parenchyma and thus protecting both dopaminergic and hippocampal neurons from neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Consequently, Fe3O4-MIN NPs + NIR treatment attenuated the motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment observed in PD mice. Notably, the Fe3O4-MIN NPs also showed high biocompatibility. Hence, these BBB-penetrating MIN-loaded Fe3O4 NPs demonstrate great therapeutic potential for PD accompanied by cognitive impairment.

Abstract: Objective
Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients generally exhibit an olfactory loss. Hence, psychophysical or electrophysiological tests are used for diagnosis. However, these tests are susceptible to the subjects’ behavioral response bias and require advanced techniques for an accurate analysis.
Proposed Approach
Using well-known feature extraction methods, we characterized chemosensory-induced EEG responses of the participants to classify whether they have PD. The classification was performed for different time intervals after chemosensory stimulation to see which temporal segment better separates healthy controls and subjects with de novo PD.
Results
The performances show that entropy and connectivity features discriminate effectively PD and HC participants when olfactory-induced EEG signals were used. For these methods, discrimination is over 80% for segments 100–700 and 200–800 milliseconds after stimulus onset.
Comparison with Existing Methods
We compared the performance of our framework with linear predictive coding, bispectrum, wavelet entropy-based methods, and TDI score-based classification. While the entropy- and connectivity-based methods elicited the highest classification performances for olfactory stimuli, the linear predictive coding-based method elicited slightly higher performance than our framework when the trigeminal stimuli were used.
Conclusion
This is one of the first studies that use chemosensory-induced EEG signals along with different feature extraction methods to classify healthy subjects and subjects with de novo PD. Our results show that entropy and functional connectivity methods unravel the chemosensory-induced neural dynamics encapsulating critical information about the subjects’ olfactory performance. Furthermore, time- and frequency-resolved feature analysis is beneficial for capturing disease-affected neural patterns.

Abstract: Background
The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) has been implicated in synaptic function throughout the brain. Accumulating evidence investigated that SV2C contributed to dopamine release and the disrupted expression of SV2C was considered to be a unique feature of PD that may facilitate dopaminergic neuron dysfunction.
Objective
This study aimed to examine the relationship between the SV2C rs1423099 single nucleotide polymorphism and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) in the Chinese Han population.
Materials and methods
This study enrolled 351 patients with sporadic PD and 240 normal controls in Chinese Han population. Peripheral blood DNA was extracted by DNA extraction kits and the rs1423099 genotype was analyzed by Agena MassARRAY DNA mass spectrometry. The differences in genotype and allele distribution frequencies between PD patients and control groups were compared using chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests.
Results
No statistical difference was revealed in age and sex distribution between the cases and control groups, and the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies was consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. In SV2C rs1423099 dominant model, the frequency of the CC/CT genotype was significantly higher in the PD group compared to the control group (OR = 4.065,95% CI: 2.801–10.870, p = 0.002). Nevertheless, in the recessive model, CC or CT/TT genotypes have no statistical difference in the two groups (p = 0.09). Additionally, in allelic analysis, the C allele was investigated to increase the risk of PD (OR = 1.346, 95% CI: 1.036–1.745, p = 0.026); Furthermore, subgroup analysis suggested that those carrying the C allele in the male subgroup were at a higher risk to afflicted with PD (OR = 1.637, 95% CI: 1.147–2.336, p = 0.006).
Conclusion
SV2C rs1423099 single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with sporadic Parkinson's disease in the Chinese Han population, particularly in males.

Abstract: Introduction
Substantial heterogeneity between individual patients in the clinical presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) has led to the classification of distinct PD subtypes. However, genetic susceptibility factors for specific PD subtypes are not well understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the genetics of PD heterogeneity by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PD subtypes.
Methods
A total of 799 PD patients were included and classified into tremor-dominant (TD) (N = 345), akinetic-rigid (AR) (N = 227), gait-difficulty (GD) (N = 82), and mixed (MX) (N = 145) phenotypic subtypes. After array genotyping and subsequent imputation, a total of 7,918,344 variants were assessed for association with each PD subtype using logistic regression models that were adjusted for age, sex, and the top five principal components of GWAS data.
Results
We identified one genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10−8), which was between the MIR3976HG rs7504760 variant and the AR subtype (Odds ratio [OR] = 6.12, P = 2.57 × 10−8). Suggestive associations (P < 1 × 10−6) were observed regarding TD for RP11-497G19.3/RP11-497G19.1 rs7304254 (OR = 3.33, P = 3.89 × 10−7), regarding GD for HES2 rs111473931 (OR = 3.18, P = 6.85 × 10−7), RP11-400D2.3/CTD-2012I17.1 rs149082205 (OR = 8.96, P = 9.08 × 10−7), and RN7SL408P/SGK1 rs56161738 (OR = 2.97, P = 6.19 × 10−7), and regarding MX for MMRN2 rs112991171 (OR = 4.98, P = 1.02 × 10−7).
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that genetic variation may account for part of the clinical heterogeneity of PD. In particular, we found a novel genome-wide significant association between MIR3976HG variation and the AR PD subtype. Replication of these findings will be important in order to better define the genetic architecture of clinical variability in PD disease presentation.

Abstract: Objective
Parkinson’s disease (PD) impairs motor and non-motor functions. Driver strategies to compensate for impairments, like avoiding driving in risky environments, may reduce on-road risk at the cost of decreasing driver mobility, independence, and quality of life (QoL). It is unclear how PD symptoms link to driving risk exposure, strategies, and QoL. We assessed associations between PD symptoms and driving exposure (1) overall, (2) in risky driving environments, and (3) in relationship to QoL.
Methods
Twenty-eight drivers with idiopathic PD were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society–Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Real-world driving was monitored for 1 month. Overall driving exposure (miles driven) and risky driving exposure (miles driven in higher risk driving environments) were assessed across PD symptom severity. High traffic, night, and interstate roads were considered risky environments.
Results
18,642 miles (30,001 km) driven were collected. Drivers with PD with worse motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS Part III) drove more overall (b = 0.17, P < .001) but less in risky environments (night: b = −0.35, P < .001; interstate roads: b = −0.23, P < .001; high traffic: b = −0.14, P < .001). Worse non-motor daily activities symptoms (MDS-UPDRS Part I) did not affect overall driving exposure (b = −0.05, P = .43) but did affect risky driving exposure. Worse non-motor daily activities increased risk exposure to interstate (b = 0.36, P < .001) and high traffic (b = 0.09, P = .03) roads while reducing nighttime risk exposure (b = −0.15, P = .01). Daily activity impacts from motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS Part II) did not affect distance driven. Reduced driving exposure (number of drives per day) was associated with worse physical health–related QoL (b = 2.87, P = .04).
Conclusions
Results provide pilot data revealing specific PD symptom impacts on driving risk exposure and QoL. Drivers with worse non-motor impairments may have greater risk exposure. In contrast, drivers with worse motor impairments may have reduced driver risk exposure. Reduced driving exposure may worsen physical health–related QoL. Results show promise for using driving to inform clinical care.

Abstract: Recent evidence supports an association between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Indeed, prospective population-based studies demonstrated that about one-third of ALS patients develop parkinsonian (PK) signs, even though different neuronal circuitries are involved. In this context, proteomics represents a valuable tool to identify unique and shared pathological pathways. Here, we used two-dimensional electrophoresis to obtain the proteomic profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from PD and ALS patients including a small cohort of ALS patients with parkinsonian signs (ALS-PK). After the removal of protein spots correlating with confounding factors, we applied a sparse partial least square discriminant analysis followed by recursive feature elimination to obtain two protein classifiers able to discriminate (i) PD and ALS patients (30 spots) and (ii) ALS-PK patients among all ALS subjects (20 spots). Functionally, the glycolysis pathway was significantly overrepresented in the first signature, while extracellular interactions and intracellular signaling were enriched in the second signature. These results represent molecular evidence at the periphery for the classification of ALS-PK as ALS patients that manifest parkinsonian signs, rather than comorbid patients suffering from both ALS and PD. Moreover, we confirmed that low levels of fibrinogen in PBMCs is a characteristic feature of PD, also when compared with another movement disorder. Collectively, we provide evidence that peripheral protein signatures are a tool to differentially investigate neurodegenerative diseases and highlight altered biochemical pathways.

Abstract: Misfolded proteins in the central nervous system can induce oxidative damage, which can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases in the mitochondria. Neurodegenerative patients face early mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting energy utilization. Amyloid-ß and tau problems both have an effect on mitochondria, which leads to mitochondrial malfunction and, ultimately, the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Cellular oxygen interaction yields reactive oxygen species within mitochondria, initiating oxidative damage to mitochondrial constituents. Parkinson's disease, linked to oxidative stress, α-synuclein aggregation, and inflammation, results from reduced brain mitochondria activity. Mitochondrial dynamics profoundly influence cellular apoptosis via distinct causative mechanisms. The condition known as Huntington's disease is characterized by an expansion of polyglutamine, primarily impactingthe cerebral cortex and striatum. Research has identified mitochondrial failure as an early pathogenic mechanism contributing to HD's selective neurodegeneration. The mitochondria are organelles that exhibit dynamism by undergoing fragmentation and fusion processes to attain optimal bioenergetic efficiency. They can also be transported along microtubules and regulateintracellular calcium homeostasis through their interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum. Additionally, the mitochondria produce free radicals. The functions of eukaryotic cells, particularly in neurons, have significantly deviated from the traditionally assigned role of cellular energy production. Most of them areimpaired in HD, which may lead to neuronal dysfunction before symptoms manifest. This article summarizes the most important changes in mitochondrial dynamics that come from neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Finally, we discussed about novel techniques that can potentially treat mitochondrial malfunction and oxidative stress in four most dominating neuro disorders.

Abstract: Most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have different degrees of movement disorders, and effective gait analysis is beneficial to find the abnormal gait of patients to achieve the diagnosis of patients with Parkinson's disease. In this paper, an “optical flow” method based on Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF) timeseries data is proposed, the algorithm takes the force point as the detection target, regards the transfer of the force point on the sole as the optical flow, and combines the optical flow of the multi-level force points to form optic flow field. To quantify the optical flow direction, the direction histogram is used to extract the direction information, and the symmetry information is further extracted according to the optical flow difference between the left and right foot, which not only realizes the fusion of multi-sensors but also extracts highly interpretable motion information. Finally, the model is trained by combining optical flow features and spatial-temporal features. The results show that the proposed model has better performance in gait detection of Parkinson's disease patients than several other state-of-the-art methods previously studied. Among them, the accuracy of Parkinson's disease diagnosis reached 93.3%, and the accuracy of severity assessment of Parkinson's disease reached 91.4%.

Abstract: Cell heterogeneous nanomaterials based therapeutic strategies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been widely investigated, however, challenged by the potential toxicity, immunogenicity, limited drug loading efficiency, and restricted penetration through biological barriers. Herein, for the first time, a medicinal plant, Pueraria lobata derived exosomes (Pu-Exos) were demonstrated with excellent capability in overcoming cellular membrane and endosomal barriers, ensuring the efficient delivery of incorporated biomacromolecule cargos to SH-SY5Y cells. Upon that, Pu-Exos comprehensively improved the mitochondrial dysfunction of SH-SY5Y cells through removing dysfunctional mitochondria via PINK1-Parkin mediated mitophagy, and restoring ATP supplementation by preserving the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and V. Pu-Exos were then engineered with the ternary ligand, DSPE-PEG-RVG, forming Pu-Exos-PR that were further optimized for the cellular uptake and brain enrichment in vivo, therefore excellently promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons, with reduced cellular degeneration, denser Nissl substance and increased tyrosine hydroxylase expression, accompanied by obviously alleviated motor and non-motor symptoms. Pu-Exos-PR were shown as a promising exosome with outstanding biocompatibility, efficient incorporation of bioactive agents, and unique feature in penetration through both nasal tissue and blood brain barrier, inaugurating new avenues to brain-targeting delivery for biomacromolecules for PD therapy. This study also casts new insight on the plant-derived exosomes as next generation of cell homogenous nanoplatforms with high efficiency and biosafety for drug delivery and therapy of brain diseases.

Abstract: Rapid, direct, and sensitive detection of metabolites or clinically relevant biomarkers in complex biological samples is still challenging. We report a label-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based approach for highly sensitive detection of dopamine (DA) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and mouse brain tissue samples. The hybrid SERS-active sensing platform was designed to maximize the hot spot distribution. It encompasses a network of flexible and polymeric nanotrenches and nanogaps fabricated by nanoimprint lithography (NIL) covered by thin films of zinc oxide (ZnO) and silver (Ag) deposited using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and direct current magnetron sputtering (DC-MS), respectively. The growth of the ZnO and Ag thin films was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The proposed SERS substrate benefits from the interlayered semiconductor–metal contribution in SERS enhancement, leading to a versatile sensing platform with improved detection sensitivity through the increased hot spots distribution. Using this strategy, the proposed assay can achieve an ultralow DA determination at the nM level, a short testing time (<30 min), and high signal reproducibility (RSD 11 %). We also assessed the sensing attributes of our in house developed SERS platform to detect DA in spiked aCSF samples, and a limit of detection (LOD) of 10 μM was achieved. Additionally, after in vivo inducing Parkinson’s disease (PD) in mice, relevant biological samples (striatum and cortical brain tissue) were investigated by SERS and ELISA. Given its good stability and accuracy in complex samples, the SERS-ELISA analysis has great potential to be a powerful tool for the reliable detection of DA in remote conditions.

Abstract: Introduction
KW-6356 is a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist/inverse agonist. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of KW-6356 as monotherapy in patients with early, untreated Parkinson's disease (PD).
Methods
This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study conducted in Japan to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily KW-6356 (3 or 6 mg/day) orally administered as monotherapy for 12 weeks in patients with early PD (NCT02939391). The primary endpoint was the least squares means of change from baseline in the MDS-UPDRS Part III total score.
Results
Overall, 168 patients were randomized and treated (KW-6356 3 mg/day n = 55; 6 mg/day n = 58, placebo n = 55); Week 12 completion rates were >90% per group. LS mean [95% CI] changes from baseline to Week 12 in MDS-UPDRS Part III total scores were −5.37 [-7.25, −3.48] for 3 mg/day, −4.76 [-6.55, −2.96] for 6 mg/day and −3.14 [−4.97, −1.30] for placebo. Changes from baseline were larger for both KW-6356 groups than for the placebo group at all time points. Secondary endpoints supported the primary findings with larger changes in MDS-UPDRS Part II, Parts II + III, and Total scores in the KW-6356 groups than in the placebo group. Treatment was well-tolerated; the most common treatment-emergent adverse events with KW-6356 were constipation (n = 4 [7.3%] and n = 6 [10.3%] in the 3 and 6 mg/day groups, respectively) followed by nasopharyngitis (n = 4 [7.3%] and n = 5 [8.6%] in the 3 and 6 mg/day groups, respectively).
Conclusion
KW-6356 monotherapy is well tolerated and more effective than placebo in patients with early, untreated PD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative condition, is distinguished by its motor dysfunction. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived from PD patients, constitute an exquisite investigative tool for elucidating the pathophysiology of the disease, assessing candidate therapeutics, and probing the potential for regenerative medicine approaches. The present study was designed to establish an iPSC line, designated TUSMi013-A, from the dermal fibroblasts of a 66-year-old female afflicted with PD, harboring mutations in VPS13C and TBP. This iPSC line offers a significant resource for the dissection of PD etiology and the innovation of novel therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is a soluble micromolecule protein expressed by SNCA gene. It makes up approximately 1% of all the cytoplasmic proteins in neurons and is highly expressed in the presynaptic and peri-nuclear regions of the central nervous system. The primary functions of αSyn include controlling synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release, dopamine metabolism, maintenance of vesicle pools, and vesicle trafficking. Parkinson's disease (PD) is linked to the presynaptic neuronal protein αSyn both in terms of its pathology and hereditary factors. While αSyn may have various functions in the development of PD, it is widely agreed that its abnormal soluble oligomeric conformations, referred to as protofibrils, are the harmful forms that disrupt the balance within cells and lead to neuronal death. These protofibrils act on different targets inside cells, such as synaptic function. Additionally, released αSyn may cause harm to nearby cells, such as aggregation seeding, which could aid in the spread of disease.

Abstract: Introduction
Heterozygous GBA1 variants are among the most frequent genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Male sex is a risk factor in the development of PD but the sex prevalence of GBA1 carriers in PD patients remains debatable. Molecular analysis of the GBA1 gene is complicated by the presence of a highly homologous pseudogene GBAP1.
Method
Starting from 2006, we screened GBA1 gene in a large cohort of 1762 PD patients through different techniques developed over the years. Identified variants were classified employing the GBA1-PD browser and compared on the basis of frequency and sex distribution.
Results
Within a group of 684 patients (40.2% Males -M-) analyzed with RFLP technique looking for the two most common GBA1 mutations L444P and N370S, 29 resulted positive (4.23%). Out of 537 patients (67.4% M) analyzed with PCR that amplifies the portion of the gene between exon 8 and exon 11, we found 53 positive carriers (9.87%). Out of 424 patients (60.8% M) analyzed with NGS custom gene panel with allele-specific PCR, 50 resulted positive (11.79%). Since 2022, we also analyzed 117 patients (56.4% M) with long PCR sequenced with NGS, identifying 17 positive samples (14.52%).
Conclusion
In our study, we highlight that screening the entire GBA1 gene with specific techniques increases the diagnostic rate. Regarding variants distribution, males have shown a higher frequency of the severe variants and complex alleles, whereas mild variants are equally distributed in both sexes and risk variants are more frequent in females especially the T369 M.

Abstract: Background
Presently, neurotransmitter deficits in GBA-related Parkinson's disease (GBA-PD) and relationships with cognitive impairment are poorly understood. A better understanding of neurotransmitter impairments in GBA-PD — particularly in the newly diagnosed drug-naïve phase — may support developing targeted intervention strategies. We aimed to investigate patterns of neurotransmitter deficits in GBA-PD and idiopathic PD (iPD) and cognitive performance correlations.
Methods
We recruited 189 newly diagnosed PD patients for GBA sequencing. Voxel-wise gray matter volume (GMV) was evaluated in a subgroup of 17 GBA-PD, 100 iPD, and 32 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). The JuSpace toolbox covering various neurotransmitter maps helped assess whether the spatial patterns of GMV alterations in GBA-PD or iPD patients (relative to HCs) were associated with specific neurotransmitter systems.
Results
GBA-PD patients indicated widespread GM atrophy in the fronto-temporal-occipital region compared with HCs. GMV atrophy was spatially correlated in GBA-PD and iPD with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and acetylcholinergic pathway distributions (p < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected). Executive function and language in cognitive domains were also associated with the strength of GMV colocalization of serotonergic, dopaminergic, and acetylcholinergic circuits.
Conclusions
Regional GM atrophy related to specific neurotransmitter deficits in de novo GBA-PD and iPD patients could provide new insights into pathophysiological processes, facilitating potential therapeutic targets to support PD management.

Abstract: Recent evidence has supported a pathogenic role for neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Inflammatory response has been associated with symptoms and subtypes of PD. However, it is unclear whether immune changes are involved in the initial pathogenesis of PD, leading to the non-motor symptoms (NMS) observed in its prodromal stage. The current study aimed to characterize the behavioral and cognitive changes in a toxin-induced model of prodromal PD-like syndrome. We also sought to investigate the role of neuroinflammation in prodromal PD-related NMS. Male mice were subjected to bilateral intranasal infusion with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or saline (control group), followed by comprehensive behavioral, pathological and neurochemical analysis. Intranasal MPTP infusion was able to cause the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). In parallel, it induced impairment in olfactory discrimination and social memory consolidation, compulsive and anxiety-like behaviors, but did not influence motor performance. Iba-1 and GFAP expressions were increased in the SN, suggesting an activated state of microglia and astrocytes. Consistent with this, MPTP mice had increased levels of IL-10 and IL-17A, and decreased levels of BDNF and TrkA mRNA in the SN. The striatum showed increased IL-17A, BDNF, and NFG levels compared to control mice. In conclusion, neuroinflammation may play an important role in the early stage of experimental PD-like syndrome, leading to cognitive and behavioral changes. Our results also indicate that intranasal administration of MPTP may represent a valuable mouse model for prodromal PD.

Abstract: Background
The symptoms of early Parkinson's disease (PD) are complex and hidden. The aim of this study is to explore and summarize the characteristics of the symptoms of drug naïve patients with PD.
Objectives
and Methods Drug-naïve patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls were recruited from the outpatient clinic of Wuhan Union Hospital. The motor and non-motor symptoms were evaluated for further analysis using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) I, II, and III; Sniffin’ Sticks Screening 12 test; Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA); and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores. The acute levodopa challenge test (ALCT) was adopted to assess the reaction to dopaminergic treatment.
Results
We recruited 80 drug-naïve patients with PD and 40 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Approximately 53.7% of the patients were females. The mean onset age was 59.96 ± 10.40 years. The mean UPDRS I, II, and III were 2.01 ± 1.90, 6.18 ± 3.68, and 26.13 ± 12.09, respectively. Compared with HCs, PD patients had lower scores in MMSE and MoCA; and higher scores in HAMA and HAMD (p < 0.05). In ALCT, 54 patients showed good responses to levodopa while 26 patients did not. The mean improvement rate of UPDRS III was 34.09% at 120 min.
Conclusion
The motor symptoms of patients with early PD were mild but virous. They also suffered from different non-motor symptoms. In ALCT, about two thirds of patients (54/80) with early PD showed good response to levodopa. Among four aspects of motor symptoms, bradykinesia reacted best to ALCT, while axial symptoms were the worst.

Abstract: Background
Previous research revealed differences in cerebellar white matter integrity by disease stages, indicating a compensatory role in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the temporal evolution of cerebellar white matter microstructure in patients with PD (PwPD) remains unclear.
Objective
To unravel temporal evolution of cerebellar white matter and its dopaminergic correlates in PD.
Methods
We recruited 124 PwPD from the PPMI study. The participants were divided into two subsets: Subset 1 (n = 41) had three MRI scans (baseline, 2 years, and 4 years), and Subset 2 (n = 106) had at least two MRI scans at baseline, 1 year, and/or 2 years. Free water-corrected diffusion metrics were used to measure the microstructural integrity in cerebellar peduncles (CP), the main white matter tracts connecting to and from the cerebellum. The ACAPULCO processing pipeline was used to assess cerebellar lobules volumes. Linear mixed-effect models were used to study longitudinal changes. We also examined the relationships between microstructural integrity in CP, striatal dopamine transporter specific binding ratio (SBR), and clinical symptoms.
Results
Microstructural changes in CP showed a non-linear pattern in PwPD. Free water-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAt) increased in the first two years but declined from 2 to 4 years, while free water-corrected mean diffusivity exhibited the opposite trend. The initial increased FAt in CP correlated with cerebellar regional volume atrophy, striatal dopaminergic SBR decline, and worsening clinical symptoms, but this correlation varied across disease stages.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest a non-linear evolution of microstructural integrity in CP throughout the course of PD, indicating the adaptive structural reorganization of the cerebellum simultaneously with progressive striatal dopaminergic degeneration in PD.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by loss of selectively vulnerable neurons within the basal ganglia circuit and progressive atrophy in subcortical and cortical regions. However, the impact of neurodegenerative pathology on the topological organization of cortical morphological networks has not been explored. The aims of this study were to investigate altered network patterns of covariance in cortical thickness and complexity, and to evaluate how morphological network integrity in PD is related to motor impairment.
Methods
Individual morphological networks were constructed for 50 PD patients and 46 healthy controls (HCs) by estimating interregional similarity distributions in surface-based indices. We performed graph theoretical analysis and network-based statistics to detect PD-related alterations and further examined the correlation of network metrics with clinical scores. Furthermore, support vector regression based on topological characteristics was applied to predict the severity of motor impairment in PD.
Results
Compared with HCs, PD patients showed lower local efficiency (p = 0.004), normalized characteristic path length (p = 0.022), and clustering coefficient (p = 0.005) for gyrification index-based morphological brain networks. Nodal topological abnormalities were mainly in the frontal, parietal and temporal regions, and impaired morphological connectivity was involved in the sensorimotor and default mode networks. The support vector regression model using network-based features allowed prediction of motor symptom severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.606.
Conclusions
This study identified a disrupted topological organization of cortical morphological networks that could substantially advance our understanding of the network degeneration mechanism of PD and might offer indicators for monitoring disease progression.

Abstract: Introduction
Outpatient palliative care offers an opportunity to improve the quality of life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and families. While there are efforts to improve clinicians' palliative care knowledge and skills, there is limited knowledge on patients and carepartners' knowledge and perceptions of palliative care. As part of a larger study on implementing outpatient palliative care, this study aimed to understand patients' and carepartners' knowledge and perceptions of palliative care, and their palliative care needs and preferences prior to the implementation.
Methods
Using qualitative descriptive research design, we completed semi-structured interviews with 47 patients and carepartners prior to the project implementation. De-identified transcripts of interviews were coded and analyzed.
Results
Five themes were identified that describe patients' and carepartners' palliative care knowledge, perceptions, needs and preferences: (a) Patients and carepartners have varied knowledge and perceptions of palliative care (b) Non-motor symptoms are challenging for patients and carepartners, (c) Addressing patients' grief and emotional needs is important to patients and carepartners, (d) Carepartners want a place for emotional care, well-being, and strategizing and (e) Patients and carepartners desire anticipatory guidance and care planning. Study participants desired guidance to manage non-motor symptoms, support for patients’ emotional needs and for carepartners, and for anticipatory guidance to guide future planning.
Conclusions
Despite varied palliative care knowledge, PD patients and carepartners universally desire care that addresses their palliative care needs. Palliative care education and integration of palliative care approaches into standard care may facilitate increased acceptance of outpatient palliative care throughout the disease trajectory.

Abstract: Background
The evaluation of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly assessed with the motor subdomain of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale (UPDRS part III) and, lately, with the MDS-UPDRS part III. To optimize efforts and special needs during specific circumstances in clinical practice, we sought to identify the most sensitive items to assess motor impairment in PD.
Methods
We included the COPPADIS-PD cohort and collected the UPDRS part III at baseline (V0), 12 months (V1), and 24 months (V2). Factor analysis and effect size using Cohen's d formula were performed in the Off and On states at V0, V1, and V2.
Results
We included 667 patients with PD, mean age of 62.59 ± 8.91 years, 410 (60.2%) males, with a median HY stage of 2.00 (1.00; 4.00) at baseline. Over time, the most discriminating items were postural stability and body bradykinesia (“arise from chair” and “gait”) in the Off state, right and left upper extremity bradykinesia ("finger tap", "hand movements" and "prono/supination") in the On state. Body bradykinesia and right-left finger tapping were the items with the largest effect size (0.93, 0.84, 0.83, respectively) to assess motor improvement after receiving antiparkinsonian medications over time.
Conclusion
Under specific circumstances, selecting a few items of the UPDRS part III, including postural stability, body bradykinesia, and upper extremity bradykinesia, could be used to create a quick clinical judgment of motor status and improvement in PD.

Abstract: Background
Immunoproteasome, a part of ubiquitin–proteasome system, is involved in immune response as well as protein degradation. However, the relationship between immunoproteasome and Parkinson's disease (PD) was not evaluated clearly. We hypothesized that the shift of immunoproteasome attributes to PD pathogenesis due to its role in inflammation and protein homeostasis.
Objective
To determine whether immunoproteasome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and brain is expressed differently between patients with PD and healthy controls (HC).
Methods
Blood samples were collected from 19 HC to 40 patients with PD of comparable ages. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and followed by RT-qPCR to measure the mRNA levels of three catalytic subunits of immunoproteasome, namely, PSMB8, PSMB9, and PSMB10. Then, the protein levels of each subunit were measured by western blot. Finally, we confirmed the altered immunoproteasome subunit in the post-mortem human brain of PD.
Results
In PBMCs, PSMB8 mRNA expression of PD group significantly increased compared to HC (p = 0.004), whereas PSMB9 and PSMB10 mRNA were not different between the PD and HC. The ratio of PSMB10 and PSMB8 mRNA (PSMB10/8 ratio) also reflected the significant difference between the PD and HC (p = 0.002). The PSMB10/8 ratio was well correlated with the UPDRS total and Part III score in the early stage of PD (Hoehn and Yahr ≤2.5) or drug-naïve PD subgroups. In terms of the protein level of immunoproteasome subunits in PBMCs, the increase of PSMB8 protein was observed in PD compared to HC (p = 0.0009), while PSMB9 and PSMB10 were not different between groups. Finally, we confirmed that immunoproteasome PSMB8 was expressed abundantly in the postmortem PD brain compared with normal control.
Conclusion
Our novel findings implicate that immunoproteasome PSMB8 is engaged in PD pathomechanism.

Abstract: Objective
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on anticholinergic burden in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the association of anticholinergic burden with cognition.
Materials and Methods
A retrospective chart review in patients with PD who underwent bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS from 2010 to 2020 reviewed medications with anticholinergic burden at baseline, six months, and one year (N = 216) after surgery. The cumulative anticholinergic burden at each visit was calculated using the Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS).
Results
ARS scores were significantly lower for patients six months and one year after surgery than at baseline (z = 6.58, p < 0.0001; z = 6.99, p < 0.0001). Change in ARS scores at both six months and one year were driven by down-titration of PD medications (z = 9.35, p < 0.0001; z = 8.61, p < 0.0001), rather than changes in pain, psychiatric, or urinary medications with anticholinergic effects. There was no significant difference in change in ARS scores at one year between targets (t = 0.41, p = 0.68). In addition, there was no significant association between anticholinergic burden and cognitive performance.
Conclusion
GPi and STN DBS are associated with decreased anticholinergic burden due to PD medications in the first year after surgery.

Abstract: The present study aimed to investigate the acute effects of aerobic exercise with different intensities on executive-related oculomotor control and cerebral dopamine/serotonin/norepinephrine metabolite concentrations in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Twenty-eight PD individuals completed acute bouts of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), and REST sessions. The order of the three sessions was counterbalanced. We assessed the concentrations of homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), as well as neuropsychological and oculomotor performance indices in the saccade paradigm at baseline and following each session. The present study found that there was no significant effect of acute HIIE or MICE on the coefficient of variation of reaction time (RT) in individuals with PD. However, HIIE resulted in significantly shorter RTs in the antisaccade condition, and MICE achieved the same in both the prosaccade and antisaccade conditions. For oculomotor performance, we observed a change in saccade peak velocity only following MICE but not HIIE. Neither of the two aerobic exercise modes significantly affected saccade amplitude and latency. In addition, concentrations of HVA and MHPG, but not 5-HIAA, significantly increased following both MICE and HIIE in individuals with PD. Notably, MICE had a greater impact on HVA compared to HIIE. We also found significant correlations between the changes in MHPG concentration, but not HVA and 5-HIAA, and RTs before and after the two aerobic exercise interventions. These results suggest that although acute HIIE and MICE protocols could not improve oculomotor control, the two aerobic exercise modes induced distinct beneficial effects on executive function and cerebral neurotransmitter concentrations in individuals with PD.

Abstract: Ozone (O3) is not only a widespread environmental contaminant at the troposphere or ground level, but also a significant reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo that participates in numerous physiological processes. Overexposure of O3 can lead to worsening of neurological diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Therefore, it is highly desirable to track O3 both in the environment and in vivo. In this work, we rationally designed and synthesized a novel coumarin-based ratiometric and mitochondria-targeting fluorescent probe, namely DPC-O3, for the recognition of O3 with high sensitivity and selectivity. In the environmental system, DPC-O3-doped fluorescent test strips were successfully prepared that allowed on-site detection of O3 in air samples by portable smartphone platform. In the biological systems, probe DPC-O3 can firstly accumulate in mitochondria and then migrate to lipid droplets after treatment of O3. Tracking of O3 was successfully achieved in the models of cellular inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, DPC-O3 was also successfully used to monitor O3 levels in the PD zebrafish model, firstly demonstrating a positive correlation between the fluctuation of endogenous O3 and PD. Hopefully, probe DPC-O3 could be a beneficial tool that may further implicate the potential for further exploration on O3-releated environmental and pathological processes.

Abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a degenerative disease driven by neuroinflammation. Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group H member 4 (NR1H4), a nuclear receptor involved in metabolic and inflammatory regulation, is found to be widely expressed in central nervous system. Previous studies suggested the protective role of NR1H4 in various diseases related to inflammation, whether NR1H4 participates in PD progression remains unknown. To investigate the role of NR1H4 in neuroinflammation regulation, especially astrocyte activation during PD, siRNA and adenovirus were used to manipulate Nr1h4 expression. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Chromatin immunoprecipitation and western blotting were performed to further study the underlying mechanisms. We identified that NR1H4 was down-regulated during PD progression. In vitro experiments suggested that Nr1h4 knockdown led to inflammatory response, reactive oxygen species generation and astrocytes activation whereasNr1h4 overexpressionhad the opposite effects. The results of RNA-seq on astrocytes revealed that NR1H4 manipulated neuroinflammation in a CEBPβ/NF-κB dependent manner. Additionally, pharmacological activation of NR1H4 via Obeticholic acid ameliorated neuroinflammation and promoted neuronal survival. Our study first proved the neuroprotective effects of NR1H4against PD via inhibiting astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation in a CEBPβ/NF-κB dependent manner.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor and psychological dysfunction. Palliative treatment and dopamine replenishment therapy are the only available therapeutic options. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been reported to protect against several neurodegenerative disorders. The current study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective impact of Felodipine (10 mg/kg, orally) as a CCB on motor and biochemical dysfunction associated with experimentally induced PD using rotenone (2.5 mg/kg, IP) and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Rotenone induced deleterious neuromotor outcomes, typical of those associated with PD. The striatum revealed increased oxidative burden and NO levels with decreased antioxidant capacity. Nrf2 content significantly decreased with the accumulation of α-synuclein and tau proteins in both the substantia nigra and striatum. These observations significantly improved with felodipine treatment. Of note, felodipine increased dopamine levels in the substantia nigra and striatum as confirmed by the suppression of inflammation and the significant reduction in striatal NF-κB and TNF-α contents. Moreover, felodipine enhanced mitophagy, as confirmed by a significant increase in mitochondrial Parkin and suppression of LC3a/b and SQSTM1/p62. In conclusion, felodipine restored dopamine synthesis, attenuated oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and improved the mitophagy process resulting in improved PD-associated motor impairment.

Abstract: Introduction
Depression is a common comorbidity in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and treatment of depression can significantly support PD management. Zishen pingchan granules (ZPG), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, may help ameliorate depressive symptoms in PD patients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of ZPG remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ZPG on serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in PD patients with depression.
Methods
Eighty PD patients treated with pramipexole but still experiencing mild to moderate depression symptoms were randomly allocated to a group receiving 12-week ZPG treatment (n = 40) or placebo (n = 40). The Hamilton Depression Scale 17 items (HAM-D-17) was utilized to evaluate changes in depressive symptoms from baseline over 12 weeks, while the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scales (UPDRS) part 3 was employed to assess changes in motor symptoms over the same duration. Serum levels of BDNF, IL-1β, IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α were measured at baseline and post-treatment.
Results
Seventy-one participants completed the study. Following treatment, both groups showed significantly reduced HAMD scores. The placebo group demonstrated a decrease in BDNF levels, while the ZPG group showed an increase in IL-6 levels post-treatment. In the examination of the group-time interaction, the ZPG group exhibited a greater decrease in HAMD scores and increase in IL-6 levels compared to the placebo group. Conversely, the placebo group showed a greater decrease in BDNF levels compared to the ZPG group. However, no significant group differences were observed in UPDRS part 3 change scores or serum levels of IL-1β, CRP, or TNF-α change from baseline.
Conclusion
ZPG may potentially ameliorate depressive symptoms in PD patients, with the potential mechanism involving mitigation of reductions in serum BDNF level and an increase in IL-6 level.

Abstract: Background
Traditionally, most centers would use microelectrode recording (MER) to refine targeting in deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. In recent years, intraoperative imaging (IMG) guided DBS has become an alternative way to verify lead placement. Currently, there is still controversy surrounding the necessity of MER or IMG for DBS. This meta-analysis aims to explore lead accuracy, clinical efficacy and safety between IMG and MER guided DBS for Parkinson's disease (PD).
Methods
PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library were searched up to Mar, 2021 for studies reporting comparisons between IMG and MER guided DBS for PD. Subgroup analysis was conducted to assess effects of different IMG technology and DBS targeting site.
Results
Six studies, comprising of 478 patients were included in our analysis. The mean difference between the two implantation techniques in stereotactic accuracy, lead passes per trajectory, improvement% of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III and levodopa equivalent daily dose were −0.45 (95% confidence interval, CI=−1.11 to 0.20), −0.18 (95% CI=−0.41 to 0.06), 3.40 (95% CI=−5.36 to 12.16), and 5.00 (95% CI=−1.40 to 11.39), respectively. No significant differences were observed in each adverse event and operation/procedure time between the two implantation techniques.
Conclusions
Both IMG and MER guided DBS offered effective control of motor symptoms for PD. Besides, IMG guided is comparable to MER guided DBS, in terms of safety, accuracy and efficiency. It is recommended for each hospital to select DBS guidance technology based on available resources and equipment.
Resumen
Antecedentes
Tradicionalmente, la mayoría de los centros usaban los microelectrodos de registro (microelectrode recording [MER]) para mejorar la orientación en la cirugía mediante la estimulación cerebral profunda (deep brain stimulation [DBS]). En los últimos años, la DBS orientada mediante imágenes intraoperatorias (intraoperative imaging guided [IMG]) se ha convertido en una forma alternativa de verificar la colocación de los electrodos. Hoy en día, todavía existe controversia en torno al uso de MER o IMG para realizar una DBS. Este metaanálisis tiene como objetivo explorar la precisión de los electrodos, la eficacia clínica y la seguridad entre la DBS guiada mediante IMG y MER en el tratamiento de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP).
Métodos
Se realizaron búsquedas en PubMed, Embase, Web of Science y Cochrane Library hasta marzo de 2021 para localizar estudios que informasen sobre comparaciones entre la DBS guiada mediante IMG y la guiada mediante MER en la EP. Se realizó un análisis de subgrupos para evaluar los efectos de una tecnología IMG y una ubicación DBS guiada diferentes.
Resultados
En nuestro análisis hemos incluido seis estudios con 478 pacientes. La diferencia media entre las dos técnicas de implantación en la precisión estereotáctica, los pasos del electrodo por trayectoria, el porcentaje de mejora de la escala unificada de clasificación de la enfermedad de Parkinson, parteIII, y la dosis diaria equivalente de levodopa fueron −0,45 (intervalo de confianza del 95% [IC 95%]: −1,11 a 0,20), −0,18 (IC 95%: −0,41 a 0,06), 3,40 (IC 95%: −5,36 a 12,16) y 5,00 (IC 95%: −1,40 a 11,39), respectivamente. No se observaron diferencias significativas en cada evento adverso y tiempo de operación/procedimiento entre las dos técnicas de implantación.
Conclusiones
Tanto la DBS guiada mediante IMG como la guiada mediante MER ofrecieron un control eficaz de los síntomas motores de la EP. Además, la DBS orientada guiada por IMG es comparable a la orientada guiada por MER en cuanto a seguridad, precisión y eficiencia. Se recomienda que cada hospital seleccione la tecnología DBS guiada en función de los recursos y del equipamiento disponibles.

Abstract: Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α (CaMKIIα) signaling in the brain plays a critical role in regulating neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis. Its dysfunctional activity is associated with various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Using computational modeling analysis, we predicted that, two essential cysteine residues contained in CaMKIIα, Cys30 and Cys289, may undergo redox modifications impacting the proper functioning of the CaMKIIα docking site for Ca2+/CaM, thus impeding the formation of the CaMKIIα:Ca2+/CaM complex, essential for a proper modulation of CaMKIIα kinase activity. Our subsequent in vitro investigations confirmed the computational predictions, specifically implicating Cys30 and Cys289 residues in impairing CaMKIIα:Ca2+/CaM interaction. We observed CaMKIIα:Ca2+/CaM complex disruption in dopamine (DA) nigrostriatal neurons of post-mortem Parkinson's disease (PD) patients' specimens, addressing the high relevance of this event in the disease. CaMKIIα:Ca2+/CaM complex disruption was also observed in both in vitro and in vivo rotenone models of PD, where this phenomenon was associated with CaMKIIα kinase hyperactivity. Moreover, we observed that, NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), a major enzymatic generator of superoxide anion (O2●-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the brain with implications in PD pathogenesis, is responsible for CaMKIIα:Ca2+/CaM complex disruption associated to a stable Ca2+CAM-independent CaMKIIα kinase activity and intracellular Ca2+ accumulation. The present study highlights the importance of oxidative stress, in disturbing the delicate balance of CaMKIIα signaling in calcium dysregulation, offering novel insights into PD pathogenesis.

Abstract: Parkinson's disorder (PD) is a chronic and central nervous system disorder that occurs when neurons in the area of the brain impairs or dies, in particular, it affects the dopamine-producing neurons. People having PD also loose chemical messenger norepinephrine, which involves in regulating the main function of physiological systems, such as heart rate and blood pressure. Researchers are working on to identify PD with a suitable biomarker and alpha-synuclein is the presynaptic neuronal protein, in the neurological lesions (Lewy bodies). This research was focused to develop an alpha-synuclein biosensor on an iron oxide (IO) nanomaterial-modified interdigitated electrode surface. Anti-alpha-synuclein aptamer was attached on IO through the amine-linker and aggregated alpha-synuclein was sandwiched between aptamer and antibody. To enhance the analytical performance, antibody was modified with gold nanoparticles and reached the detection limit of 10 aM, determined on a linear range between 101 and 107 aM [y = 2.5812×-0.0081; R2 = 0.9729]. Further, control molecules failed to increase the current responses indicating the specific detection of alpha-synuclein and the CSF-spiked alpha-synuclein increases the current responses, confirming the selective detection.

Abstract: Background and objectives:
Dynamic handwriting analysis, due to its noninvasive and readily accessible nature, has emerged as a vital adjunctive method for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). An essential step involves analysing subtle variations in signals to quantify PD dysgraphia. Although previous studies have explored extracting features from the overall signal, they may ignore the potential importance of local signal segments. In this study, we propose a lightweight network architecture to analyse dynamic handwriting signal segments of patients and present visual diagnostic results, providing an efficient diagnostic method.
Methods:
To analyse subtle variations in handwriting, we investigate time-dependent patterns in local representation of handwriting signals. Specifically, we segment the handwriting signal into fixed-length sequential segments and design a compact one-dimensional (1D) hybrid network to extract discriminative temporal features for classifying each local segment. Finally, the category of the handwriting signal is fully diagnosed through a majority voting scheme.
Results:
The proposed method achieves impressive diagnostic performance on the new DraWritePD dataset (with an accuracy of 96.2%, sensitivity of 94.5% and specificity of 97.3%) and the well-established PaHaW dataset (with an accuracy of 90.7%, sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 87.5%). Moreover, the network architecture stands out for its excellent lightweight design, occupying a mere 0.084M parameters, with only 0.59M floating-point operations. It also exhibits nearly real-time CPU inference performance, with the inference time for a single handwriting signal ranging from 0.106 to 0.220 s.
Conclusions:
We present a series of experiments with extensive analysis, which systematically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in quantifying dysgraphia for a precise diagnosis of PD.

Abstract: Background and Objective:
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative brain diseases worldwide. Therefore, accurate PD screening is crucial for early clinical intervention and treatment. Recent clinical research indicates that changes in pathology, such as the texture and thickness of the retinal layers, can serve as biomarkers for clinical PD diagnosis based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. However, the pathological manifestations of PD in the retinal layers are subtle compared to the more salient lesions associated with retinal diseases.
Methods:
Inspired by textural edge feature extraction in frequency domain learning, we aim to explore a potential approach to enhance the distinction between the feature distributions in retinal layers of PD cases and healthy controls. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet novel wavelet-based selection and recalibration module to effectively enhance the feature representations of the deep neural network by aggregating the unique clinical properties, such as the retinal layers in each frequency band. We combine this module with the residual block to form a deep network named Wavelet-based Selection and Recalibration Network (WaveSRNet) for automatic PD screening.
Results:
The extensive experiments on a clinical PD-OCT dataset and two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Visualization analysis and ablation studies are conducted to enhance the explainability of WaveSRNet in the decision-making process.
Conclusions:
Our results suggest the potential role of the retina as an assessment tool for PD. Visual analysis shows that PD-related elements include not only certain retinal layers but also the location of the fovea in OCT images.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative chronic illness which affects primarily the elderly over 45 years of age. The symptoms can be various, both non-motor and motor symptoms can appear. The biggest problem in the treatment of the disease is the difficulty in swallowing for the patients. However, buccal patches can solve this problem because the patients do not have to swallow the dosage form, and during application, the API can absorb from the area of the buccal mucosa quickly without causing a foreign body sensation. In our present study, we focused on the development of buccal polymer films with pramipexole dihydrochloride (PR). Films with different compositions were formulated and their mechanical properties and chemical interactions were investigated. The biocompatibility of the film compositions was examined on the TR146 buccal cell line. The permeation of PR was also monitored across the TR146 human cell line. It can be stated that the plasticizer can enhance the thickness and the breaking hardness of the films, while not decreasing their mucoadhesivity significantly. All formulations proved to have cell viability higher than 87%. Finally, we found the best composition (3% SA+1% GLY-PR-Sample1) which can be applied on the buccal mucosa in the treatment of PD.

Abstract: Finding low-cost and insightful methods to reinforce the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is a major challenge today, and using dynamic handwritten data may be one of the solutions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods can be used to create predictive models for disease diagnosis. In the case of machine learning models, in addition to maximising their accuracy, it is important to ensure that prediction models for disease diagnosis explain prediction results. The fuzzy classifiers using a set of IF-THEN statements with fuzzy terms often used in natural discourse suit this purpose. This study proposes a fuzzy classifier method consisting of three-stage: generating the structure, selecting the informative features, and optimising the parameters. Thirty-two variants of the method with different metaheuristic algorithms are recommended. Experiments have been conducted on publicly available handwritten signal databases for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease such as ParkinsonHW, PaHaW, NewHandPD. ParkinsonHW contains handwriting of 40 people including 25 patients with Parkinson’s disease. Handwriting tasks were drawing spirals and meanders. PaHaW contains handwriting of 75 people including 37 patients with Parkinson’s disease. Handwritten tasks consisted of drawing spirals and writing letters, bigrams, trigrams, words and sentences in Czech. NewHandPD contains handwriting of 66 people including 31 patients with Parkinson’s disease. Handwriting tasks were drawing spirals, meanders and circles. Results of statistical comparison of efficiency with alternative interpretable classifiers — decision trees and fuzzy genetic systems have shown the advantage of some variants of realisation in the accuracy of the prediction and interpretability. Achieved results may indicate the applicability of the proposed method for constructing fuzzy classifiers as a diagnostic tool.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in middle-aged and elderly people, and many studies have confirmed that the disorder of gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological process of PD. However, the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of PD is still lacking. In this study, to investigate the impact of PD-associated gut microbiota on host transcriptome, we established various PD models with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the model organism Drosophila followed by integrative data analysis of microbiome and transcriptome. We first constructed rotenone-induced PD models in Drosophila followed by FMT in different groups. Microbial analysis by 16S rDNA sequencing showed that gut microbiota from PD Drosophila could affect bacterial structure of normal Drosophila, and gut microbiota from normal Drosophila could affect bacterial structure of PD Drosophila. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PD-associated gut microbiota influenced expression patterns of genes enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, lysosome, and diverse metabolic pathways. Importantly, to verify our findings, we transplanted Drosophila with fecal samples from clinical PD patients. Compared to the control, Drosophila transplanted with fecal samples from PD patients had reduced microbiota Acetobacter and Lactobacillus, and differentially expressed genes enriched in diverse metabolic pathways. In summary, our results reveal the influence of PD-associated gut microbiota on host gene expression, and this study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and PD pathogenesis through gut-brain axis.
IMPORTANCE
Gut microbiota plays important roles in regulating host gene expression and physiology through complex mechanisms. Recently, it has been suggested that disorder of gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological process of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of PD is still lacking. In this study, to investigate the impact of PD-associated gut microbiota on host transcriptome, we established various PD models with fecal microbiota transplantation in the model organism Drosophila followed by integrative data analysis of microbiome and transcriptome. We also verified our findings by transplanting Drosophila with fecal samples from clinical PD patients. Our results demonstrated that PD-associated gut microbiota can induce differentially expressed genes enriched in diverse metabolic pathways. This study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and PD pathogenesis through gut-brain axis.

Abstract: The current study presents the creation of a straightforward and sensitive sensor based on ZnO/Co3O4 nanocomposite modified screen-printed electrode (ZnO/Co3O4NC/SPE) for levodopa determination. At ZnO/Co3O4NC/SPE, an oxidative peak for levodopa solution in pH 6.0 phosphate buffer solution (PBS) were seen that were both more resolved and more enhanced. Levodopa was measured using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), which showed an excellent linear range (0.001–800.0 μM) and detection limit (0.81 nM). The presence of interference did not affect the electrochemical response of levodopa at ZnO/Co3O4NC/SPE, demonstrating high selectivity. Levodopa in a real samples have been successfully detected using the manufactured sensor.

Abstract: Parkinsonism is a complex neurodegenerative disease that is difficult to differentiate because of its idiopathic and unknown origins. The hereditary parkinsonism known as autosomal recessive-juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) is marked by tremors, dyskinesias, dystonic characteristics, and manifestations that improve sleep but do not include dementia. This was caused by deletions and point mutations in PARK2 (chromosome 6q25.2–27). Diminished or unusual sensations (paresthesias), loss of neuron strength both in the CNS and peripheral nerves, and lack of motor coordination are the hallmarks of neuropathy in parkinsonism. The incidence of parkinsonism during oxidative stress and ageing is associated with parkinopathy. Parkinopathy is hypothesized to be triggered by mutation of the parkin (PRKN) gene and loss of normal physiological functions of PRKN proteins, which triggers their pathogenic aggregation due to conformational changes. Two important genes that control mitochondrial health are PRKN and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1). Overexpression of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) increases the aggregation of insoluble PRKN proteins in OMM. Foreign α-synuclein (ASN) promotes parkinopathy via S-nitrosylation and hence has a neurotoxic effect on dopaminergic nerves. Miro1 (Miro GTPase1), a member of the RAS superfamily, is expressed in nerve cells. Due to PINK1/PRKN and Miro1's functional relationship, an excess of mitochondrial calcium culminates in the destruction of dopaminergic neurons. An interlinked understanding of TDP-43, PINK1/PRKN, ASN, and Miro1 signalling in the communication among astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and immune cells within the brain explored the pathway of neuronal death and shed light on novel strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of parkinsonism.

Abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, with emerging research suggesting a critical link between intestinal dysbiosis and PD progression. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PD, such as alpha-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, while focusing on the impact of gut dysbiosis on intestinal barrier function and its role in reduced neurochemical production. The clinical features of PD, including dopamine, serotonin, and GABA deficiencies, are examined, with a focus on how dysbiosis contributes to neurotransmitter depletion. Current treatments of PD, such as levodopa and dopamine agonists, are discussed alongside gut health therapies such as probiotics, prebiotics, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT). Future therapeutic directions, including synbiotics, engineered microbes, phage therapy, and the integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), are explored. The chapter also considers preventive strategies, such as lifestyle adjustments and early gut health monitoring using modern diagnostic tools and biosensors. Furthermore, a strong need for continued research into the gut-brain axis (GBA) to develop more effective, gut-targeted therapies for managing PD is discussed.

Abstract: The polarization phenotype of microglia is critical in the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Molecules that can polarize microglia toward the M2 phenotype represent a promising class of compounds for anti-PD medications. Z-ligustilide (ZLG) is a naturally occurring enol ester with diverse pharmacological properties, especially in neuroprotection. For the first time, we investigated the effect of ZLG on anti-PD and elucidated its underlying mechanism. The results primarily showed that ZLG attenuated motor deficits in mice and prevented the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Mechanistically, ZLG alleviates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of microglia by triggering the endogenous antioxidant system. Besides, ZLG modulated phenotypic polarization of the microglia through the activation of the Nrf2-TrxR axis, leading to microglia polarization towards the M2 phenotype. Taken together, our research showed that ZLG is a prospective therapy candidate for PD by altering microglia polarization and restoring redox equilibrium through the Nrf2-TrxR axis.

Abstract: Rehabilitation using external cues has shown positive impact on Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) severity in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Research studies on FoG detection and prediction are widely accessible, however little is known about transitions from “FoG” to “normal-gait” phases and vice-versa. Especially, for the patient to recover completely from the freeze event as well as to avoid undesirable distractions due to long-term cue persistence, post-FoG periods must be optimally chosen for managing automatic cue deactivation. Therefore, our study attempts to device a machine-learning based approach for labelling of accelerometer data with state-transitions from “normal-gait” to “FoG” (i.e., FoG-prediction) as well as from “FoG” to “normal-gait” (i.e., unfreeze-prediction). Our prediction approach distinguishes itself by innovating in sensor utilization, feature-extraction, and latency reduction. We introduce a novel four-class labeling scheme based on state transitions, diverging from fixed-time periods utilized in prior studies. Model training involves regression and classification with a streamlined set of 23 hybrid features, minimizing latency with reduced window segments and operating on 4-second and 3-second pre- and post-FoG time-frames, respectively, exhibiting minimal 0.5-second latency. Our approach simply required one shank sensor providing minimum-instrumentation for the user's comfort. Four-class (No-FoG, pre-FoG, FoG, and post-FoG) data have been fed to train random-forest classifier. Our FoG prediction model achieved exceptional metrics, particularly for the “post-FoG” class, with 99.0 % accuracy, 97.4 % precision, 99.1 % sensitivity, and 98.1 % f1-score, along with 99.0 % cohen’s-kappa, 98.3 % jaccard-index, and 99.0 % Matthews-correlation-coefficient. Therefore, an intelligent-strategy for timely activation and deactivation of cues is the major contribution of our work.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is the second most prevalent neurological disease after Alzheimer’s. Primarily, old age males are more affected than females. The aggregates of oligomeric forms of α-synuclein cause the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Further, it leads to dopamine shortage in the striatum region. According to recent preclinical studies, environmental factors like pesticides, food supplements, pathogens, etc. enter the body through the mouth or nose and ultimately reach the gut. Further, these factors get accumulated in enteric nervous system which leads to misfolding of α-synuclein gene, and aggregation of this gene results in Lewy pathology in the gut and reaches to the brain through the vagus nerve. This evidence showed a strong bidirectional connection between the gut and the brain, which leads to gastrointestinal problems in Parkinson patients. Moreover, several studies reveal that patients with Parkinson experience more gastrointestinal issues in the early stages of the disease, such as constipation, increased motility, gut inflammation, etc. This review article focuses on the transmission of α-synuclein and the mechanisms involved in the link between the gut and the brain in Parkinson’s disease. Also, this review explores the various pathways involved in Parkinson and current therapeutic approaches for the improvement of Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Summary
Background
New non-pharmacological treatments for improving non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are urgently needed. Previous light therapies for modifying sleep behaviour lacked standardised protocols and were not personalised for an individual patient chronotype. We aimed to assess the efficacy of a biologically-directed light therapy in PD that targets retinal inputs to the circadian system on sleep, as well as other non-motor and motor functions.
Methods
In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled trial at the Queensland University of Technology, Australia, participants with mild to moderate PD were computer randomised (1:1) to receive one of two light therapies that had the same photometric luminance and visual appearance to allow blinding of investigators and participants to the intervention. One of these biologically-directed lights matched natural daylight (Day Mel), which is known to stimulate melanopsin cells. The light therapy of the other treatment arm of the study, specifically supplemented the stimulation of retinal melanopsin cells (Enhanced Mel), targeting deficits to the circadian system. Both lights were administered 30 min per day over 4-weeks and personalised to an individual patient's chronotype, while monitoring environmental light exposure with actigraphy. Co-primary endpoints were a change from baseline in mean sleep macrostructure (polysomnography, PSG) and an endocrine biomarker of circadian phase (dim light melatonin secretion onset, DLMO) at weeks 4 and 6. Participants data were analysed using an intention to treat principle. All endpoints were evaluated by applying a mixed model analysis. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12621000077864.
Findings
Between February 4, 2021 and August 8, 2022, 144 participants with PD were consecutively screened, 60 enrolled and randomly assigned to a light intervention. There was no significant difference in co-primary outcomes between randomised groups overall or at any individual timepoint during follow-up. The mean (95% CI) for PSG, N3% was 24.15 (19.82–28.48) for Day Mel (n = 23) and 19.34 (15.20–23.47) for the Enhanced Mel group (n = 25) in week 4 (p = 0.12); and 21.13 (16.99–25.28) for Day Mel (n = 26) and 18.48 (14.34–22.62) for the Enhanced Mel group (n = 25) in week 6, (p = 0.37). The mean (95% CI) DLMO (decimal time) was 19.82 (19.20–20.44) for Day Mel (n = 22) and 19.44 (18.85–20.04) for the Enhanced Mel group (n = 24) in week 4 (p = 0.38); and 19.90 (19.27–20.53) for Day Mel (n = 23) and 19.04 (18.44–19.64) for the Enhanced Mel group (n = 25) in week 6 (p = 0.05). However, both the controlled daylight (Day Mel) and the enhanced melanopsin (Enhanced Mel) interventions demonstrated significant improvement in primary PSG sleep macrostructure. The restorative deep sleep phase (PSG, N3) significantly improved at week 6 in both groups [model-based mean difference to baseline (95% CI): −3.87 (−6.91 to −0.83), p = 0.04]. There was a phase-advance in DLMO in both groups which did not reach statistical significance between groups at any time-point. There were no safety concerns or severe adverse events related to the intervention.
Interpretation
Both the controlled daylight and melanopsin booster light showed efficacy in improving measures of restorative deep sleep in people with mild to moderate PD. That there was no significant difference between the two intervention groups may be due to the early disease stage. The findings suggest that controlled indoor daylight that is personalised to the individuals’ chronotype could be effective for improving sleep in early to moderate PD, and further studies evaluating controlled daylight interventions are now required utilising this standardised approach, including in advanced PD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease represented by the progressive loss of dopamine producing neurons, with motor and non-motor symptoms that may be hard to distinguish from other disorders. Affecting millions of people across the world, its symptoms include bradykinesia, tremors, depression, rigidity, postural instability, cognitive decline, and falls. Furthermore, changes in gait can be used as a primary diagnosis factor. A dataset is described that records data on healthy individuals and on PD patients, including those who experience freezing of gait, in both the ON and OFF-medication states. The dataset is comprised of data for four separate tasks: voluntary stop, timed up and go, simple motor task, and dual motor and cognitive task. Seven different classifiers are applied to two problems relating to this data. The first problem is to distinguish PD patients from healthy individuals, both overall and per task. The second problem is to determine the effectiveness of medication. A thorough analysis on the classifiers and their results is performed. Overall, multilayer perceptron and decision tree provide the most consistent results.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) represents a multifaceted neurological challenge, necessitating a comprehensive exploration of its complications. This study delves into two vital segments: neuroinflammation and the glymphatic system. Neuroinflammation serves as the central nervous system's defense mechanism while potentially harming neurons. This investigation meticulously examines neuroinflammation, explaining its categorizations, molecular underpinnings, and intricate association with PD. The glymphatic system appears as a sentinel of cerebral hygiene and neuronal preservation. An in-depth examination of its anatomical structure and functional significance uncover its potential implications in the context of PD. This chapter explores the pivotal roles of neuroinflammation and the glymphatic system in PD. We delve into the definition, classification, and mechanisms of neuroinflammation, emphasizing its relevance to neurodegenerative diseases like PD. Simultaneously, we unravel the glymphatic system's anatomy, functions, and implications for neurological diseases. Within the context of PD, we scrutinize neuroinflammatory processes, biomarkers, and their impact on disease progression. The interplay between the glymphatic system and PD is examined, and potential therapeutic interventions are discussed. We also highlight computational approaches for early PD diagnosis and the latest therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation and glymphatic disturbances, offering insights into the future of PD treatment.

Abstract: MAOs are flavoenzymes that aid in the oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and epinephrine. MAO inhibitors are antidepressants that act by inhibiting neurotransmitter breakdown in the brain and controlling mood. MAO inhibitors with the chlorophenyl-chromone-carboxamide structure have been shown in investigations to be extremely effective. The current study employs in-silico screening, MD simulation, and drug kinetics evaluation, all of which are evaluated using different criteria. The study comprised 37 ligands, and three stood out as the best, with greater binding scores above the threshold value. Docking analysis found that compound 34 had the highest docking score in the series (−13.60 ​kcal/mol) and interacted with the important amino acids TYR 435, CYS 397, CYS 172, PHE 343, TYR 398, and LYS 296 required for MAO inhibitory activity. The ADMET study revealed that the compounds had drug-like properties. The results of this study could be used to develop chromone drugs that target the MAO inhibitor. The top three ligands with the highest force and work were then simulated using molecular dynamics. The protein-ligand complexes had steady trajectories throughout the 100 ns simulation, according to the data. Furthermore, the drug likeliness predicted by ADMET analysis findings indicated that the top three lead compounds had strong inhibitory efficiency, superior pharmacokinetics, and were non-toxic under physiological settings. As a result, these compounds have the potential to be exploited as possible treatment medications for PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting 60% of people over the age of 50 years. Patients with Parkinson's (PWP) face mobility challenges and speech difficulties, making physical visits for treatment and monitoring a hurdle. PD can be treated through early detection, thus enabling patients to lead a normal life. The rise of an aging population over the world emphasizes the need to detect PD early, remotely and accurately. This paper highlights the use of machine learning techniques in telemedicine to detect PD in its early stages. Research has been carried out on the MDVP audio data of 30 PWP and healthy people during training of 4 ML models. Comparison of results of classification by Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models, yield Random Forest classifier as the ideal Machine Learning (ML) technique for detection of PD. Random Forest classifier model has a detection accuracy of 91.83% and sensitivity of 0.95. Through the findings of this paper, we aim to promote the use of ML in telemedicine, thereby providing a new lease of life to patients suffering from Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Abnormal tryptophan metabolism is closely linked with neurological disorders. Research has shown that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1), the first rate-limiting enzyme in tryptophan degradation, is upregulated in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the precise role of IDO-1 in PD pathogenesis remains elusive. In this study, we administered 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT), an IDO-1 inhibitor, intraperitoneally at 15 mg/kg daily for 21 days to PD mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) at 30 mg/kg daily for 5 days. Our results show that IDO-1 inhibition improves behavioral performance, reduces dopaminergic neuron loss, and decreases serum quinolinic acid (QA) content and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) expression in the striatum and colon. It also alleviates glial-associated neuroinflammation and mitigates colonic inflammation (decreasing iNOS, COX2) by suppressing the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB (TLR4/NF-κB) pathway. Furthermore, IDO-1 inhibition promotes hippocampal neurogenesis (increasing doublecortin positive (DCX+) cells and SOX2+ cells), which have recently been recognized as key pathological features and potential therapeutic targets in PD, likely through the activation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway. We further explored the gut-brain connection by depleting the gut microbiota in mice using antibiotics. Notably, the neuroprotective effects of IDO-1 inhibition were completely abolished in pseudo-germ-free mice (administrated an antibiotic mixture orally for 14 days prior to 1-MT treatment), highlighting the dependency of 1-MT's neuroprotective effects on the presence of gut microbiota. Finally, we found IDO-1 inhibition corrects the abnormal elevation of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Collectively, these findings suggest that IDO-1 inhibition may represent a promising therapeutic approach for PD.

Abstract: Objective
The objective of this study is to explore the brain activity alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) from the perspectives of neuronal activity, synchronization of neuronal activity, and coordination of whole-brain activity.
Methods
In this study, we recruited 38 PD patients and 35 matched healthy controls (HCs). We explored intrinsic brain activity alterations in PD by comparing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) metrics of the amplitude of low-frequency of fluctuation (ALFF), the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and degree centrality (DC). Two-sample t-tests were used to determine the differences between the two groups. Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the relationships between abnormal ALFF, fALFF, PerAF, ReHo, and DC values and clinical indicators such as the Movement Disorder Society’s Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage, and duration of disease.
Results
Compared with the HCs, PD had increased ALFF,fALFF, and PerAF in the temporal lobe and cerebellum, and decreased ALFF,fALFF, and PerAF in the occipital-parietal lobe in the neuronal activity. In the synchronization of neuronal activity, PD patients had increased ReHo in the right inferior parietal lobule and decreased ReHo in the caudate. In the coordination of whole-brain activity, PD patients had increased DC in the cerebellum and decreased DC in the occipital lobe. Correlation analysis showed that there is a correlation between abnormal brain regions and clinical indicators in PD. Notably, the changes in occipital lobe brain activity were found in ALFF, fALFF, PerAF, and DC, and were most correlated with the clinical indicators of PD patients.
Conclusions
This study found that intrinsic brain function in several occipital-temporal-parietal and cerebellum regions was altered in PD patients, potentially related to the clinical indicators of PD. These results may enhance our understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of PD and may contribute to further exploring the selection of therapeutic targets in PD patients.

Abstract: Heightened oxidative stress is the principal driver behind the altered metabolism of neurotransmitters within the brains of Parkinson's disease (PD). Hypochlorous acid (HClO), a variant of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a crucial role in several lysosomal activities. An irregular concentration of HClO may result in significant molecular damage and contribute to the onset of neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this, the precise role of lysosomal HClO in PD remains unclear, due to its fast reactivity and low levels. This is further complicated by the lack of effective in situ imaging techniques for accurately tracking its dynamics. Therefore, it is of great significance to use effective tools to map the lysosomal HClO during the pathological process of PD. In this study, we propose a fluorogenic probe named Lys-PTZ-HClO for the specific and sensitive detection of HClO. Lys-PTZ-HClO exhibits features like a fast response time (10 s) and a low detection limit (0.72 μM). Benefiting from its superior properties, the probe was used to visualize the basal HClO levels, and the variation of HClO levels in lysosomal of living cells. More importantly, this probe was successfully applied for the first time to reveal increased lysosomal HClO in a cellular model of PD.

Abstract: Introduction
Telemedicine could represent an emerging and innovative approach to support cognitive and behavioral rehabilitation reducing the overload of healthcare facilities, favoring home care therapy. The present study aimed to assess the potential efficacy of Tele-VR apps in enhancing cognitive performance and improving social skills in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
Methods
Thirty-four patients with PD were included in the study. Patients were assigned to one of the following treatment groups: Experimental Group 1 (EG1) underwent a Tele-VR program using two cognitive rehabilitation applications (app) on smartphones (Neuronation-Brain Training and Train your Brain); Experimental Group 2 (EG2) received a Tele-VR program through one cognitive rehabilitation app (Neuronation-Brain Training) and one socio-cognitive rehabilitation App (The Sims) on smartphones; Active Control Group (aCG) performed a conventional training using pencil and paper exercises (Not-VR).
Results
At the end of the study, the aCG and EG1 presented an improvement in the executive, attentional and visuospatial cognitive domains. Mood and subjective memory also improved in the EG1. Moreover, in the EG2 group, a significant improvement was found in all cognitive domains, including social cognition skills (theory of mind). The inter-group comparison showed that both EG1 and EG2 had significantly greater improvements than aCG in MoCA score. Finally, both EG1 and EG2 showed a higher improvement in the FAB score, as compared to the aCG.
Conclusion
Rehabilitation with smartphone apps could be more useful than conventional rehabilitation in improving cognitive and social cognition skills in patients with PD. Combining cognitive and social cognition training could improve the cognitive and affective domains, also aiding in the long-term maintenance of cognitive outcomes.

(+)-Borneol Protects Dopaminergic Neuronal Loss in Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-Induced Parkinson’s Disease Mice: A Study of Dopamine Level using In Vivo Brain Microdialysis,

Abstract: Considerable research efforts have been directed toward the symptom relief of Parkinson’s disease (PD) by attenuating dopamine (DA) depletion. One common feature of these existing therapies is their unavailability of preventing the neurodegenerative process of dopaminergic neurons. (+)-Borneol, a natural highly lipid-soluble bicyclic monoterpene, has been reported to regulate the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and exhibit neuroprotective effects. However, the effect of (+)-borneol on the dopaminergic neuronal loss of methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice is not defined. Herein, we first report that 30 mg/kg (+)-borneol significantly attenuated the motor deficits of PD mice, which benefits from markedly increasing the level of DA and decreasing the metabolic rate of DA in the striatum of conscious and freely moving mouse detected by ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry online combined with in vivo brain microdialysis sampling. It is worth noting that the enhanced level of DA by (+)-borneol was enabled by the reduction in loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum and promotion of reserpine- or nomifensine-induced DA release in PD mice. Interestingly, (+)-borneol evidently inhibited the decreased expression levels of DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) on the MPTP mouse model of PD. Moreover, (+)-borneol suppressed the neuroinflammation by inhibiting the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and attenuated oxidative stress by decreasing the level of MDA and increasing the activities of SOD and GSH-px in PD mice. These findings demonstrate that (+)-borneol protects DA neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Further research work for the neuroprotection mechanism of (+)-borneol will focus on reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, (+)-borneol is a potential therapeutic candidate for retarding the neurodegenerative process of PD.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn), and microglial activation. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) regulates multiple functions of microglia in the brain, and several studies have shown that TREM2 variant R47H is a risk factor for PD. However, the regulation of microglia by TREM2 in PD remains poorly understood.
Methods
We constructed PD cell and animal models using α-syn preformed fibrils. siRNA knockdown and lentiviral overexpression were used to perturb TREM2 levels in cells, and TREM2 knockout mice and lentiviral overexpression was used in animal models to investigate the effects of TREM2 on microglial function, α-syn-related pathology, and dopaminergic neuron degeneration.
Results
Microglia phagocytosed α-syn preformed fibrils in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with some capacity to degrade α-syn aggregates. TREM2 expression increased in PD. In the context of PD, TREM2 knockout mice exhibited worsened pathological α-syn spread, decreased microglial reactivity, and increased loss of TH-positive neurons in the substantia nigra compared to wild-type mice. TREM2 overexpression enhanced reactive microglial aggregation towards the pathological site. Cellular experiments revealed that reduced TREM2 impaired microglial phagocytosis and proliferation, but enhanced autophagy via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
Conclusion
TREM2 signaling in PD maintains microglial phagocytosis, proliferation, and reactivity, stabilizing autophagy and proliferation via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Regulating TREM2 levels may be beneficial in PD treatment.

Simultaneous 5-HT1BR agonist/5-HT6R antagonist action as a potential treatment of Parkinson’s disease and its comorbidities,

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) treatment focuses mainly on the augmentation of dopamine transmission, but to alleviate adverse motor effects accompanying L-DOPA use, additional treatments with serotonergic (5-HT) medications may be considered. We propose a novel concept based on the simultaneous activation of 5-HT1BR and 5-HT6R blockade as a putative therapeutic option for PD treatment. We have developed PZKKN-94, a dual human 5-HT1BR agonist (EC50 = 39 nM) and human 5-HT6R antagonist (KB = 7.7 nM), with selectivity over 43 targets, favorable drug-like properties, and brain penetration. Importantly, PZKKN-94 potency was increased or retained at rat 5-HT1B and 5-HT6 orthologs but not at mouse 5-HT6. Therefore, PZKKN-94 was tested in 2 rat disease models: haloperidol-induced catalepsy and 6-hydroxydopamine–induced sensorimotor deficits in rats, showing antiparkinsonian-like effects in both. Of note, PZKKN-94 did not affect the therapeutic effects of L-DOPA and attenuated L-DOPA–induced motor fluctuation (“on-off” phenomena) in the stepping and vibrissae tests. PZKKN-94 had no effect on L-DOPA–induced contralateral rotation, suggesting no impact on dopamine-mimetic medication effects. In addition, PZKKN-94 reversed scopolamine-, phencyclidine-, and aged-induced learning deficits in the rat novel object recognition test, increased cognitive flexibility in the attention set-shifting task, and displayed antidepressant-like actions in the forced swim test in rats. Our data suggest that dual-acting 5-HT1BR agonists/5-HT6R antagonists provide a novel therapeutic approach to alleviate both motor symptoms and accompanying cognitive and depression comorbidities in PD. Our present findings highlight the dual 5-HT1BR agonist/5-HT6R antagonist strategy to simultaneously spare L-DOPA’s action and alleviate motor fluctuations related to L-DOPA treatment.
Significance Statement
The commonly used L-DOPA–based medications for Parkinson’s disease, though effective in alleviating initial disease states, are limited in long-term use due to the motor (dyskinesia and on-off phenomena) and nonmotor (psychotic-like) side effects. A novel nondopaminergic strategy for treatment of Parkinson’s disease based on simultaneous activation of the 5-HT1B receptor and blockade of the 5-HT6 receptor is proposed. The compound PZKKN-94 produces an antiparkinsonian-like effect and attenuates motor fluctuations, preserving the efficacy of L-DOPA. In addition, PZKKN-94 demonstrates procognitive and antidepressant-like properties.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder globally, with an incidence of roughly 0.5%–1% for those aged 65–69, increasing to 1%–3% for those aged 80 and over. It is a multi-system and multi-symptomatic disorder which occurs due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Currently, there is no viable cure, with treatments only being able to provide symptomatic relief. l-Dopa is the primary drug prescribed for Parkinson's disease. Although it can improve motor function and improve the quality of life in patients, there is an inter-individual variability, and some patients do not receive any therapeutic benefit. Variations in treatment response and side effects of current drugs can be overcome by using gene editing systems to provide therapy. Genetic causes can explain 10% of all cases of PD, which is caused by mutation of specific genes. CRISPR/Cas9, a powerful gene editing tool, can be used in various ways to study and potentially treat Parkinson's disease. The CRISPR/Cas9 system primarily consists of a complementary RNA sequence that recognizes specific target DNA and directs Cas nuclease for genome editing, thereby regulating gene activity and protein expression in PD pathogenesis. CRISPR/Cas9 system could correct or inactivate mutations caused by monogenic recessive and dominant-negative disorders for therapeutic benefits. The use of CRISPR/Cas9 systems for epigenome editing in this fashion is a novel and appealing approach for gene therapy, as it represents new smart drugs designed to target specific genes. The manipulation of gene expression, e.g., reversing overexpression of mutant, is a valuable therapeutic strategy for PD. While CRISPR-based therapies are still in their early stages, several approaches are being explored. Mutations in PINK1, PRKN, SNCA, and LRRK2 genes are widely attributed to the development of PD. These mutated genes provide an attractive target for CRISPR/cas9-based genome editing to leverage their potential in the treatment of PD. The following chapter will provide insight into the current applications of CRISPR/cas9 in PD, including disease modeling, regulation of alpha-synuclein, neuroprotection and the latest developments in the delivery mechanism of CRISPR/cas9, and the future of CRISPR/cas9 in PD.

Abstract: We recently described increased D- and L-serine concentrations in the striatum of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkeys, the post-mortem caudate-putamen of human Parkinson's disease (PD) brains and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of de novo living PD patients. However, data regarding blood D- and L-serine levels in PD are scarce. Here, we investigated whether the serum profile of D- and L-serine, as well as the other glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ionotropic receptor (NMDAR)-related amino acids, (i) differs between PD patients and healthy controls (HC) and (ii) correlates with clinical-demographic features and levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) in PD. Eighty-three consecutive PD patients and forty-one HC were enrolled. PD cohort underwent an extensive clinical characterization. Serum levels of D- and L-serine, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate, L-asparagine and glycine were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, no differences emerged in the serum levels of D-serine, L-serine and other NMDAR-related amino acids between PD and HC. However, we found that D-serine and D−/Total serine ratio positively correlated with age in PD but not in HC, and also with PD age at onset. Moreover, we found that higher LEDD correlated with lower levels of D-serine and the other excitatory amino acids. Following these results, the addition of LEDD as covariate in the analyses disclosed a selective significant increase of D-serine in PD compared to HC (Δ ≈ 38%). Overall, these findings suggest that serum D-serine and D−/Total serine may represent a valuable biochemical signature of PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a myriad of symptoms, encompassing both motor disabilities and cognitive impairments. Recent research has shown that abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone found in various brain regions of several mammals and exhibits neuroprotective properties. To investigate the effects of ABA on cognitive and motor disorders, a mouse model of PD was utilized. The administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to the lateral ventricles was conducted, with ABA (10 and 15 μg/mouse, i. c.v.) being administered for one week after the 6-OHDA injection for 4 days. Motor and cognitive performance were evaluated through the use of open field, rotarod, wire grip, and shuttle box tests. The results indicated that cognitive function and motor disorders were significantly impaired in 6-OHDA-treated animals. However, in mice treated with 6-OHDA, ABA (15 μg/mouse) significantly reversed balance and muscle strength deficits. It should be noted that the administration of ABA did not significantly improve cognitive impairment or rearing in Parkinsonism mice. Therefore, the findings suggest that ABA plays a crucial role in protecting mice from motor disabilities caused by 6-OHDA.

Abstract: Objectives
Aimed to investigate whether there are abnormal changes in the functional connectivity (FC) between the amygdala with other brain areas, in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with anxiety.
Methods
Participants were enrolled prospectively, and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating (HAMA) Scale was used to quantify anxiety disorder. Rest-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was applied to analyze the amygdala FC patterns among anxious PD patients, non-anxious PD patients, and healthy controls.
Results
Thirty-three PD patients were recruited, 13 with anxiety, 20 without anxiety, and 19 non-anxious healthy controls. In anxious PD patients, FC between the amygdala with the hippocampus, putamen, intraparietal sulcus, and precuneus showed abnormal alterations compared with non-anxious PD patients and healthy controls. In particular, FC between the amygdala and hippocampus negatively correlated with the HAMA score (r = −0.459, p = 0.007).
Conclusion
Our results support the role of the fear circuit in emotional regulation in PD with anxiety. Also, the abnormal FC patterns of the amygdala could preliminarily explain the neural mechanisms of anxiety in PD.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disease, and half of PD patients have hypertension as well. The effect of antihypertensive drugs on the progression of PD has been less studied. The focus of this study was on the changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) levels to assess the effect of antihypertensive drugs on the progression of PD.
Methods
Data from 321 drug-naïve patients from the Parkinson's Disease Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) were collected over a 2-year period. Patients were divided into the PD with arterial hypertension (AH) group (102 cases) with antihypertensive drugs, the PD with other cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) group (60 cases) with antidiabetic and/or lipid-lowering drugs, and the pure PD group (159 cases) without CVRFs. The Movement Disorder Society Sponsored Revision Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Hoehn-Yahr (H&Y) stage were used to assess progression. DAT semiquantitative values were used to evaluate damage to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, including the contralateral and ipsilateral count density ratio and asymmetry index.
Results
There were no significant differences among the three groups in MDS-UPDRS score and H&Y stage. Changes in DAT levels among the three groups were without distinct differences in the first year and second year. In each group, DAT decreased more in the first year than in the second year. There was no decrease in DAT uptake in the PD with AH group compared with the other groups during the follow-up period.
Conclusions
There is no evidence that antihypertensive drugs can delay PD progression within 2 years.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s can impact people’s speech, cognition, pragmatics, and language, significantly affecting their conversations with others. The speech and language therapy approach called communication partner training (CPT) is effective for a range of communication difficulties. However, speech and language therapy interventions for people with Parkinson’s predominantly focus on impairments, with little provision of CPT for this population. Better Conversations is a CPT approach that involves working with a dyad (the person with the communication difficulty and a conversation partner [CP]) to build conversation skills. It is effective at reducing barriers to conversation, and for some, it significantly increases targeted facilitatory strategies. Some approaches to CPT have been adapted to be delivered via telehealth. This can maximize ecological validity and convenience. Furthermore, telehealth is widely accepted as a delivery method for other interventions for Parkinson’s. This study presents the protocol for a pilot feasibility study of a Better Conversations CPT delivered via telehealth to people living with Parkinson’s and their CPs, called Better Conversations with Parkinson’s (BCP).
Objective
The primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility of the BCP program delivered via telehealth with a treatment group from a collaborating National Health Service (NHS) site to establish for a main trial whether BCP can be delivered as intended in an NHS setting. The aim is to establish: (1) the acceptability of the program for people living with Parkinson’s, family members, and speech and language therapists (SLTs); (2) the feasibility of delivering the BCP program; (3) the recruitment and retention rates; (4) a sample size calculation; and (5) the most appropriate primary outcome measure.
Methods
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from London-Central Research Ethics Committee (reference: 22/LO/0332). This case-series feasibility pilot study will recruit 10-12 dyads to ensure 10 complete data sets. Participants will be recruited by a collaborating NHS site located in England. Participants will be involved for 16 weeks (weeks 1-2 preintervention measures, weeks 3-8 intervention, weeks 10-12 postintervention measures, week 16 follow-up interview). Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to analyze the study data. Speech, communication, and quality of life assessment data will be analyzed statistically to determine a suitably sensitive outcome measure. Descriptive statistics will be used to report on recruitment, attendance, and attrition. Finally, acceptability and feasibility will be evaluated using participant feedback, interviews, and the reflective diary and feedback of the SLT administering the therapy (by the research assistant who is the first author). This data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and reflexive thematic analysis.
Results
This study was approved for funding from Parkinson’s UK. Study recruitment commenced in July 2022. The results of the data analysis are expected to be available by September 2024.
Conclusions
Insights from this study will provide valuable information about the acceptability and feasibility of a remotely delivered Better Conversations CPT approach for people living with Parkinson’s and their CPs. An outcome of this study will be a manualized BCP program coproduced by people living with Parkinson’s, their families, and a group of expert SLTs.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting motor and non-motor functions, with no effective treatment yet discovered. Neuroprotective compounds, both natural and synthetic, show promise but face challenges such as crossing the blood-brain barrier, limited serum stability, and higher toxicity. To tackle these obstacles, we have devised an innovative design strategy inspired by the neuroprotective properties of Leonurine, widely utilized in managing neurological disorders. Through rigorous screening of our compound library, we have identified a potent therapeutic molecule (MJ210) that exhibited remarkable efficacy in bolstering neuroprotection against rotenone-induced PD models, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings revealed that administering MJ210 significantly increased neuronal survival in the SH-SY5Y model of PD. This was achieved by preventing apoptosis, reducing reactive oxygen species, mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction, and dampening neuroinflammation via ERK1/2-P38-JNK and P65-NFκB signaling pathways. In addition, MJ210 demonstrated remarkable neuroprotective abilities in vivo by significantly enhancing dopamine biosynthesis, alleviating motor dysfunction, improving balance and coordination, and reversing depression in rotenone-induced PD rats, even outperforming L-DOPA, the current gold standard treatment for PD. Therefore, MJ210 emerges as a significantly promising therapeutic candidate for PD, offering the potential for managing both the severity and progression of this disease.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease can impose substantial distress and costs on patients, their families and caregivers, and health care systems. To address these burdens for families and health care systems, there is a need to better support patient self-management. To achieve this, an overview of the current state of the literature on self-management is needed to identify what is being done, how well it is working, and what might be missing.
Objective
The aim of this scoping review was to provide an overview of the current body of research on self-management interventions for people with Parkinson disease and identify any knowledge gaps.
Methods
The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) and Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study type frameworks were used to structure the methodology of the review. Due to time and resource constraints, 1 reviewer systematically searched 4 databases (PubMed, Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science) for the evaluations of self-management interventions for Parkinson disease published in English. The references were screened using the EndNote X9 citation management software, titles and abstracts were manually reviewed, and studies were selected for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria. Data were extracted into a pre-established form and synthesized in a descriptive analysis.
Results
There was variation among the studies on study design, sample size, intervention type, and outcomes measured. The randomized controlled trials had the strongest evidence of effectiveness: 5 out of 8 randomized controlled trials found a significant difference between groups favoring the intervention on their primary outcome, and the remaining 3 had significant effects on at least some of the secondary outcomes. The 2 interventions included in the review that targeted mental health outcomes both found significant changes over time, and the 3 algorithms evaluated performed well. The remaining studies examined patient perceptions, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness and found generally positive results.
Conclusions
This scoping review identified a wide variety of interventions designed to support various aspects of self-management for people with Parkinson disease. The studies all generally reported positive results, and although the strength of the evidence varied, it suggests that self-management interventions are promising for improving the care and outcomes of people with Parkinson disease. However, the research tended to focus on the motor aspects of Parkinson disease, with few nonmotor or holistic interventions, and there was a lack of evaluation of cost-effectiveness. This research will be important to providing self-management interventions that meet the varied and diverse needs of people with Parkinson disease and determining which interventions are worth promoting for widespread adoption.

Abstract: This study aimed to explore the clinical effects of intervention with Lycium ruthenicum Murr. (LR) and Lycium barbarum L. (LB) on PD patients, reveal the mechanism by which gut microbiota is involved in the overall metabolism of PD patients. The study examined the effects of LR and LB intake on intestinal microflora, serum/urine metabolites, and the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) in 30 PD patients enrolled and randomized into 3 groups. Each received 16 g LR daily or 16 g LB daily or blank control for 6 months. The study found that LR and LB intervention reduced the MDS-UPDRS Ⅰ score and MDS-UPDRS Ⅳ score, although not statistically significant. The abundance of Bacteroides increased and the abundance of Flavobacteriaceae in the LR group decreased compared to the control group. LR may regulate the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, and α-linolenic acid metabolism pathway to slow down the progress of PD. After LB intervention, the abundance of Lachnoclostridium increased, the abundance of Blautia, norank_f__Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus and norank_f__Lachnospiraceae decreased in the LB group, and compared to the control group, the abundance of Agathobacter increased, the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Flavobacteriaceae decreased. The results showed that LB may improve PD symptoms by regulating glycine, serine and threonine metabolism pathways, sphingolipid metabolism pathways, and starch and sucrose metabolism pathways. This study provides evidence support for LR and LB as medicinal and food homologous functional foods to improve PD disorders.

Abstract: Background
Speech impairment is commonly reported in Parkinson's disease and is not consistently improved by available therapies – including deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS), which can worsen communication performance in some patients. Improving the outcome of STN-DBS on speech is difficult due to our incomplete understanding of the contribution of the STN to fluent speaking.
Objective
To assess the relationship between subthalamic neural activity and speech production and intelligibility.
Methods
We investigated bilateral STN local field potentials (LFPs) in nine parkinsonian patients chronically implanted with DBS during overt reading. LFP spectral features were correlated with clinical scores and measures of speech intelligibility.
Results
Overt reading was associated with increased beta-low ([1220) Hz) power in the left STN, whereas speech intelligibility correlated positively with beta-high ([2030) Hz) power in the right STN.
Conclusion
We identified separate contributions from frequency and brain lateralization of the STN in the execution of an overt reading motor task and its intelligibility. This subcortical organization could be exploited for new adaptive stimulation strategies capable of identifying the occurrence of speaking behavior and facilitating its functional execution.

Abstract: Introduction
Functional mobility is an important outcome for people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). Despite this, there is no established patient-reported outcome measure that serves as a gold standard for assessing patient-reported functional mobility in PwP. We aimed to validate the algorithm calculating the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) based Functional Mobility Composite Score (FMCS).
Methods
We designed a count-based algorithm to measure patient-reported functional mobility in PwP from items of the PDQ-39 subscales mobility and activities of daily living. Convergent validity of the algorithm calculating the PDQ-39-based FMCS was assessed using the objective Timed Up and Go (n = 253) and discriminative validity was assessed by comparing the FMCS with patient-reported (MDS-UPDRS II) and clinician-assessed (MDS-UPDRS III) motor symptoms as well as between disease stages (H&Y) and PIGD phenotypes (n = 736). Participants were between 22 and 92 years old, with a disease duration from 0 to 32 years and 64.9% in a H&Y 1–2 ranging from 1 to 5.
Results
Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) ranging from −0.45 to −0.77 (p < 0.001) indicated convergent validity. Hence, a t-test suggested sufficient ability of the FMCS to discriminate (p < 0.001) between patient-reported and clinician-assessed motor symptoms. More specifically, FMCS was more strongly associated with patient-reported MDS-UPDRS II (rs = −0.77) than clinician-reported MDS-UPDRS III (rs = −0.45) and can discriminate between disease stages as between PIGD phenotypes (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
The FMCS is a valid composite score to assess functional mobility through patient reports in PwP for studying functional mobility in studies using the PDQ-39.

Abstract: Introduction
Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that affects the substantia nigra pars compacta and dopaminergic neurons in the brain stem. Since zonulin and claudin-5 are involved in intestinal and brain endothelial permeability and it is hypothesized that the brain-gut axis is relevant in IPD, the aim of our study is to evaluate whether the relationship between Zonulin and Claudin-5 levels and Parkinson's Disease patients.
Methods
A total of 139 patients, including 34 mild, 33 moderate, 39 severe stage patients and 33 healthy controls were included. The patients’ demographic data, age of onset, disease duration, disease type and drugs were noted. UPDRS and H&Y scores were evaluated. Prodromal stage symptoms and non-motor symptoms were noted. Zonulin and Claudin-5 levels in the serum were studied.
Results
The mean Zonulin value was significantly higher in the IPD group compared to the control one (16.0 ± 10.5 vs. 11.1 ± 4.3; p = 0.0012). Likewise, the mean Claudin-5 value in the IPD group was again significantly higher than in the control group (8.4 ± 5.5 vs. 6.2 ± 3.4; p = 0.0003). The combined ROC curve, though, showed only modest albeit significant discriminant ability. Moreover, neither zonulin nor claudin-5 related to age, phenotype or disease duration, and in terms of non-motor symptoms there was only a significant association between zonulin and urine problems and between claudin-5 and sleep symptoms.
Conclusion
Our results suggest an association of these markers of intestinal and brain endothelial permeability and IPD, although these remain modest and preliminary and warrant further consideration in larger studies including prodromal cases.

Abstract: Dopamine metabolism, alpha-synuclein pathology, and iron homeostasis have all been implicated as potential contributors to the unique vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons which preferentially decline in Parkinson's disease and some rare neurodegenerative disorders with shared pathological features. However, the mechanisms contributing to disease progression and resulting in dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra are still not completely understood. Increasing evidence demonstrates that disrupted dopamine, alpha-synuclein, and/or iron pathways, when combined with the unique morphological, physiological, and metabolic features of this neuron population, may culminate in weakened resilience to multiple stressors. This review analyzes the involvement of each of these pathways in dopamine neuron physiology and function, and discusses how disrupted interplay of dopamine, alpha-synuclein, and iron pathways may synergize to promote pathology and drive the unique vulnerability to disease states. We suggest that elucidating the interactions of dopamine with iron and alpha-synuclein, and the role of dopamine metabolism in driving pathogenic phenotypes will be critical for developing therapeutics to prevent progression in diseases that show degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons such as Parkinson's disease and the rare family of disorders known as Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease is a neurodegenerative disease causing a progressive loss of autonomy. This requires long-term rehabilitation care. Currently, new technologies are being developed for use in daily life, and there is a progressive implementation of telerehabilitation.
Objective
The aim of this study (the TELEP@RK study) is to evaluate the uses of a digital self-rehabilitation device in patients with Parkinson disease and their independent physiotherapists on the scale of a health territory.
Methods
A total of 10 independent physiotherapists and 31 patients with Parkinson disease were followed for 1 year to evaluate the use of a telerehabilitation tool (digital tablet and inertial sensor) via questionnaires of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). The questionnaires were submitted to participants at 0, 2, and 12 months from the start of follow-up. The averages of the scores of the different determinants and constructs of the UTAUT questionnaires were compared at the different follow-up times.
Results
Among professionals, the averages of the various determinants were generally high at the beginning of the study with an average (out of 5) performance expectancy of 4.19, effort expectancy of 3.88, social influence of 3.95, facilitating conditions of 4, and intention to use of 3.97. These averages decreased over time.
Conclusions
Acceptability, acceptance, and appropriation of the tool were very high among the physiotherapists as well as the patients, despite the tool’s lack of evolution during the study. In the current health care context, these results allow us to envision a new organization of the care pathway for patients with chronic diseases, with the increased use of new technologies associated with telecare.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the elder population, and its etiology is enigmatic. Both environmental risks and genetics may influence the development of PD. Excess copper causes neurotoxicity and accelerates the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of copper-induced neurotoxicity remain controversial. In this study, A53T transgenic α-synuclein (A53T) mice and their matching wild-type (WT) mice were treated with a low dose of copper (0.13 ppm copper chlorinated drinking water, equivalent to the copper exposure of human daily copper intake dose) for 4 months, and copper poisoning was performed on human A53T mutant SHSY5Y cells overexpressed with α-synuclein (dose of 1/4 IC50), to test the effects of copper exposure on the body. The results of the open field test showed that the moto function of Cu-treated mice was impaired. Proteomics revealed changes in neurodevelopment, transport function, and mitochondrial membrane-related function in Cu-treated WT mice, which were associated with reduced expression of mitochondrial complex (NDUFA10, ATP5A), dopamine neurons (TH), and dopamine transporter (DAT). Mitochondrial function, nervous system development, synaptic function, and immune response were altered in Cu-treated A53T mice. These changes were associated with increased mitochondrial splitting protein (Drp1), decreased mitochondrial fusion protein (OPA1, Mfn1), abnormalities in mitochondrial autophagy protein (LC3BII/I, P62), decreased dopamine neuron (TH) expression, increased α-synuclein expression, inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α) release and microglia (Iba1) activation. In addition, we found that Cu2+ (30 μM) induced excessive ROS production and reduced mitochondrial ATP production in human A53T mutant α-synuclein overexpressing SHSY5Y cells by in vitro experiments. In conclusion, low-dose copper treatment altered critical proteins involved in mitochondrial, neurodevelopmental, and inflammatory responses and affected mitochondria's ROS and ATP production levels.
