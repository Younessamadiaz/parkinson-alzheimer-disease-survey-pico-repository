Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly affects motor functions, including gait, leading to shuffling steps, festinating gait, and freezing of gait. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial, as timely intervention can mitigate disease progression. This paper presents an ensemble learning approach to improve early recognition of PD through gait analysis. We construct a dataset of over 2,000 samples from both PD patients and healthy controls, utilizing 6-axis Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to capture gait metrics. An adaptive ensemble learning model, incorporating five different classifiers, is trained on this dataset, achieving an F1 score of 96.54% and an accuracy of 96.61% in distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls.","","979-8-3315-1709-0","10.1109/ACAIT63902.2024.11022046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11022046","ensemble learning;gait analysis;inertial measurement units (IMUs);parkinson's disease;sixth-Generation communication technology (6G)","6G mobile communication;Adaptation models;Measurement units;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Refining;Inertial navigation;Communications technology;Ensemble learning;Gait recognition","","","","10","IEEE","10 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the early stages, symptoms are mild and patients may ignore their existence. As a result, they do not undergo any related clinical examination; hence delaying their PD diagnosis. In an effort to remedy such delay, analysis of data passively captured from user's interaction with consumer technologies has been recently explored towards remote screening of early PD motor signs. In the current study, a smartphone-based method analyzing subjects' finger interaction with the smartphone screen is developed for the quantification of fine-motor skills decline in early PD using Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results from the analysis of keystroke typing in-the-clinic data from 18 early PD patients and 15 healthy controls have shown a classification performance of 0.89 Area Under the Curve (AUC) with 0.79/0.79 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. Evaluation of the generalization ability of the proposed approach was made by its application on typing data arising from a separate self-reported cohort of 27 PD patients' and 84 healthy controls' daily usage with their personal smartphones (data in-the-wild), achieving 0.79 AUC with 0.74/0.78 sensitivity/specificity, respectively. The results show the potentiality of the proposed approach to process keystroke dynamics arising from users' natural typing activity to detect PD, which contributes to the development of digital tools for remote pathological symptom screening.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8857211","","Keyboards;Pipelines;Parkinson's disease;Convolutional neural networks;Tools;Monitoring","Early Diagnosis;Humans;Motor Skills;Neural Networks, Computer;Parkinson Disease;Sensitivity and Specificity;Smartphone;User-Computer Interface","17","","13","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A more efficient system is required to cope with the growing world population and increased life expectancy, which is associated with a marked prevalence of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). One possible approach to meet this demand is a laterally distributed platform such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Real-time motion metrics in PD could be obtained virtually in any scenario by placing lightweight wearable sensors in the patient's clothes and connecting them to a medical database through mobile devices such as cell phones or tablets. Technologies exist to collect huge amounts of patient data not only during regular medical visits but also at home during activities of daily life. These data could be fed into intelligent algorithms to first discriminate relevant threatening conditions, adjust medications based on online obtained physical deficits, and facilitate strategies to modify disease progression. A major impact of this approach lies in its efficiency, by maximizing resources and drastically improving the patient experience. The patient participates actively in disease management via combined objective device- and self-assessment and by sharing information within both medical and peer groups. Here, we review and discuss the existing wearable technologies and the Internet-of-Things concept applied to PD, with an emphasis on how this technological platform may lead to a shift in paradigm in terms of diagnostics and treatment.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2461555","FAU Emerging Fields Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7169494","Wearable technologies;Internet of Things;Parkinson’s disease;knowledge discovery;patients;Internet of things (IoT);knowledge discovery;parkinson's disease (PD);patients;wearable technologies","Parkinson's disease;Biomedical monitoring;Internet of things;Wearable sensors","Cell Phone;Humans;Internet;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Parkinson Disease;Telemedicine","272","","112","IEEE","28 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its main clinical manifestations are a variety of movement disorders, including abnormal gait, which seriously affect the performance of motor function, leading to shaking hands at rest, bradykinesia, myotonia, and difficulty in maintaining postural balance. The current work focuses on the methods of wearable devices and non-wearable devices to evaluate sports injuries. However, the network models based on the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) to quantify the severity of Parkinson's disease injuries have problems such as incomplete generalization of input features, insufficient feature extraction of network models, and imbalance between recognition accuracy and model size. A lightweight and high-precision convolutional neural network model is essential for accurate and quantitative assessment of disease progression and for slowing or preventing further disease progression. Regarding the above issues, we use a computer vision-based model to observe video recordings of the human body, extract their 3D body skeletons, track them through time, and input them into our proposed a Triple-feature Triple-motion Convolutional Neural Network (PE-TTNET) with Positional encoding for training. We position encode the triple scale features and classify the gait severity of PD patients based on MDS-UPDRS. The experimental results indicate that PE-TTNET achieved better results compared to previous network models in testing the clinical dataset we collected, with higher Fl-score and average accuracy in classifying the severity level of Parkinson's disease.","","979-8-3503-1452-6","10.1109/AINIT59027.2023.10212599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10212599","Convolutional Neural Network;3D body skeletons;Parkinson's disease","Three-dimensional displays;Parkinson's disease;Computational modeling;Wearable computers;Feature extraction;Bones;Encoding","","1","","14","IEEE","21 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ideally, identification is the best practice for control and intervention; nevertheless, traditional approaches used in diagnosing may fail to detect the disease during its early stage. This paper aims to determine whether DBNs are suitable for detecting PD early since they can assess complicated and high-dimensional medical information. During the DBN modelling, the data used here were trained and tested using publicly available datasets, and the accuracy level recorded was 92 percent. In comparison, the sensitivity was 90 percent, and the specificity was 94 percent. The ROC-AVC of the timing of task execution was calculated to be 0. 95 percent in the diagnostic capacity, which indeed indicates the high level had been maintained. According to the above results, the DBN model provided superior performance to other diagnostic methods, which include a low false-negative rate. Traditional techniques, where the diagnosis depends on a doctor's assignment and imaging techniques, are usually less accurate and take more time to detect diseases early. It is crucial to note that this research proves the DBN model's feature of recognizing little deviations that hint at early-stage Parkinson's disease, making for a robust and practical diagnostic application.

The prototype has been developed using a triboelectric sensor based on Ecoflex™ and PEDOT:PSS that is placed on the forearm. The movement of the skin above the forearm muscles and tendons correlates with the extension and flexion of fingers and hands. This way, the small gap of 0.5 cm between the polymer layers is displaced, generating voltage due to the triboelectric contact. Signals from preliminary experiments can discriminate different dynamics of emulated tremor and bradykinesia in hands and fingers. A modified version of the TS is integrated with a printed circuit board (PCB) in a single package with signal conditioning and wireless data transmission.

Unlike our previous works and the majority of the published studies, where UPDRS tasks were the sole focus, in this paper, we carry out a comparative investigation of the LA, S2S, and G tasks. In particular, after providing an accurate description of the features identified for the kinematic characterization of the three tasks, we comment on the correlation between the most relevant kinematic parameters and the UPDRS scoring. We analyzed the performance achieved by the automatic UPDRS scoring system and compared the estimated UPDRS evaluation with the one performed by neurologists, showing that the proposed system compares favorably with typical interrater variability. We then investigated the correlations between the UPDRS scores assigned to the various tasks by both the neurologists and the automatic system. The results, based on a limited number of subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) (34 patients, 47 clinical trials), show poor-to-moderate correlations between the UPDRS scores of different tasks, highlighting that the patients' motor performance may vary significantly from one task to another, since different tasks relate to different aspects of the disease. An aggregate UPDRS score is also considered as a concise parameter, which can provide additional information on the overall level of the motor impairments of a Parkinson's patient. Finally, we discuss a possible implementation of a practical e-health application for the remote monitoring of PD patients.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2472640","Italian Ministry of Health(grant numbers:RF-2009-1472190); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7222382","Body Sensor Network (BSN);Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU);Parkinson’s Disease (PD);Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS);Leg Agility (LA) task;Sit-to- Stand (S2S) task;Gait (G) task;Body sensor network (BSN);gait (G) task;inertial measurement unit (IMU);leg agility (LA) task;Parkinson's disease (PD);sit-to-stand (S2S) task;unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS)","Kinematics;Feature extraction;Parkinson's disease;Body sensor networks","Adult;Aged;Biomechanical Phenomena;Female;Gait;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Parkinson Disease;Posture;Telerehabilitation","78","","31","IEEE","25 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study suggests deploying a deep belief network (DBN) method, considered a highly advanced machine learning algorithm, which is more of a memory structure capable of learning deeply and hierarchically.

Wearable sensors have been demonstrated to help overcoming such a difficulty, by providing objective measures of motor abnormalities. However, up to now, those sensors have been used on advanced PD patients with evident motor impairment. As a novelty, here we report the impact of wearable sensors in the evaluation of motor abnormalities in newly diagnosed, untreated, namely de novo, patients. Methods: A network of wearable sensors was used to measure motor capabilities, in 30 de novo PD patients and 30 healthy subjects, while performing five motor tasks. Measurement data were used to determine motor features useful to highlight impairments and were compared with the corresponding clinical scores. Three classifiers were used to differentiate PD from healthy subjects. Results: Motor features gathered from wearable sensors showed a high degree of significance in discriminating the early untreated de novo PD patients from the healthy subjects, with 95% accuracy. The rates of severity obtained from the measured features are partially in agreement with the clinical scores, with some highlighted, though justified, exceptions. Conclusion: Our findings support the feasibility of adopting wearable sensors in the detection of motor anomalies in early, untreated, PD patients. Significance: This work demonstrates that subtle motor impairments, occurring in de novo patients, can be evidenced by means of wearable sensors, providing clinicians with instrumental tools as suitable supports for early diagnosis, and subsequent management.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2903627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8662663","IMU;machine learning;motion analysis;parkinson's disease;signal processing;wearable technology","Task analysis;Wearable sensors;Biomedical measurement;Parkinson's disease;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","Accelerometry;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Equipment Design;Female;Humans;Machine Learning;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Physiologic;Movement;Parkinson Disease;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Wearable Electronic Devices","63","","54","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This will enhance quality of life (QoL) in PD through improved self-monitoring and also provide information that could be shared with a healthcare provider to help better manage treatment. Until recently, nonmotor symptoms (“soft signs”) had been generally overlooked in clinical management, yet these are of primary importance to patients and their QoL. Day-to-day variability of the condition, the high variability in symptoms between patients, and the isolated snapshots of a patient in periodic clinic visits make better monitoring essential to the proper management of PD. Continuously monitored patterns of activity, social interactions, and daily activities could provide a rich source of information on status changes, guiding self-correction and clinical management. The same tools can be useful in earlier detection of PD and will improve clinical studies. Remote medical communications in the form of telemedicine, sophisticated tracking of medication use, and assistive technologies that directly compensate for disease-related challenges are examples of other near-term technology solutions to PD problems. Ultimately, a sensor technology is not good if it is not used.

To address this issue, we employ sensor systems to collect tremor parameters from PD patients and analyzed these collected data using traditional machine learning algorithms, providing an objective and quantitative diagnosis for PD. To obtain more comprehensive features, this study adopts the PKG wearable device to extract 12 tremor features from 100 PD patients, along with recording 9 scale-based features and 3 demographic characteristics. Furthermore, to overcome the issues of low accuracy and poor generalization ability of traditional machine learning methods, we propose a capsule network integrated with a self-attention mechanism (SA-CapsNet) for classifying and predicting early stage and moderate to advanced stage stage PD patients. We also utilize the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve the model's ability to generalize. Lastly, The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model is introduced to improve the interpretability of the predictive model, and feature analysis is conducted to identify the main factors influencing classification and prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the SA-CapsNet method for PD can achieve an accuracy of 92.31%, precision of 82.19%, recall of 91.23%, specificity of 80.00%, and an F1 score of 85.25%.
