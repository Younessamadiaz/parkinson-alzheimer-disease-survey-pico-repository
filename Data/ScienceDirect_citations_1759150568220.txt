Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease marked by a combination of motor and non-motor symptoms. The molecular mechanism of PD remains unexplained, and there is currently no genetic risk factor with clinically proven reliability. Therefore, diagnosing PD has relied chiefly on analyzing brain images and clinical tests. Understanding the molecular-level mechanism of PD is challenging, primarily due to the complexities involved in sampling the posterior brains of both typical individuals and those with PD; however, several independent research have recently produced and assessed extensive omics data obtained from blood samples, making the diagnosis cheap and less invasive. Therefore, developing diagnostic or predictive methods for PD utilizing these data is necessary. In addition, integrating omics data can serve as a valuable asset for a comprehensive understanding of the disease. This research devised a computational approach to predict PD by integrating gene expression and DNA methylation datasets. The significant challenges were the high dimensionality and heterogeneous data sources. A two-level statistical approach is proposed to identify Differentially expressed and Methylated Genes. Archimedes Optimization Algorithm, a meta-heuristic algorithm, selects 17 optimal genes and 18 mapping CpG sites. A clustering-based method is proposed to integrate the heterogeneous omics data. Predictions of PD and healthy samples are performed using the Tabnet classification model. The proposed approach demonstrated an ROC-AUC of 0.7615 and an F1-score of 0.7325 on test data. The significance of our work is supported by biological analysis and assessment metrics.

Abstract: Previous resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) analyses of the basal ganglia in Parkinson’s disease heavily relied on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) atlases. However, subcortical structures are characterized by subtle contrast differences, making their accurate delineation challenging on T1WI. In this study, we aimed to introduce and validate a method that incorporates quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) into the rs-fMRI analytical pipeline to achieve precise subcortical nuclei segmentation and improve the stability of RSFC measurements in Parkinson’s disease. A total of 321 participants (148 patients with Parkinson’s Disease and 173 normal controls) were enrolled. We performed cross-modal registration at the individual level for rs-fMRI to QSM (FUNC2QSM) and T1WI (FUNC2T1), respectively.The consistency and accuracy of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) measurements in two registration approaches were assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient and mutual information. Bootstrap analysis was performed to validate the stability of the RSFC differences between Parkinson’s disease and normal controls. RSFC-based machine learning models were constructed for Parkinson’s disease classification, using optimized hyperparameters (RandomizedSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation). The consistency of RSFC measurements between the two registration methods was poor, whereas the QSM-guided approach showed better mutual information values, suggesting higher registration accuracy. The disruptions of RSFC identified with the QSM-guided approach were more stable and reliable, as confirmed by bootstrap analysis. In classification models, the QSM-guided method consistently outperformed the T1WI-guided method, achieving higher test-set ROC-AUC values (FUNC2QSM: 0.87–0.90, FUNC2T1: 0.67–0.70). The QSM-guided approach effectively enhanced the accuracy of subcortical segmentation and the stability of RSFC measurement, thus facilitating future biomarker development in Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Background
The prevailing treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is not yet satisfactory. The present investigate the neuroprotective effect of the GLP-1/GIP dual agonist tirzepatide and examine the potential mechanisms involved.
Methods
Analysis of GLP1 receptor (GLP1R) and GIPR expression alterations in dopaminergic neurons from PD patients in the GSE238129 dataset. The MPTP-induced subacute PD mice was treated with tirzepatide, semaglutide and levodopa. Behavioral tests and brain histopathology of mice were evaluated. The transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of ultrastructural alterations in the mitochondrial morphology. The ATP level was assessed in substantia nigra. Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were employed to quantify Drp1 and mitophagy proteins. Furthermore, Drp1 inhibitor and mitophagy activator were used to treat MPTP-induced subacute PD mice, and lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were used in SY5Y cells for validation.
Results
The gene expression levels of both GLP1R and GIPR were significantly downregulated in dopaminergic neurons derived from PD patients. Tirzepatide could significantly ameliorate MPTP-induced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein in the substantia nigra. There was no statistically difference observed between one-third doses of tirzepatide when compared with semaglutide and levodopa. In addition, tirzepatide not only improved mitochondrial ultrastructure, but also enhanced mitochondrial ATP content. Tirzepatide was found to reduce Drp1 expression and reverse the expressions of mitophagy-related proteins, including Pink1, Parkin, and p62. There was no statistically difference observed between one-third doses of tirzepatide compared with semaglutide in mitochondrial energy control. In addition, we observed that MPTP-induced subacute PD mice treated with a Drp1 inhibitor and mitophagy activator exhibited therapeutic effects. In SY5Y cells, lysosomal and autophagy inhibitors significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP levels, and the NAD+/NADH ratio.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the benefits of tirzepatide extend to mitochondrial networks, achieved by means of the inhibition of mitochondrial pathological fission, the promotion of mitophagy, in MPTP-induced subacute PD mice or cells model.

Abstract: L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a frequent complication of chronic L-DOPA therapy in the clinical treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The pathogenesis of LID involves complex molecular mechanisms in the striatum. Metabolomics can shed light on striatal metabolic alterations in LID. In the present study, we compared metabolomics profiles of striatum tissue from Parkinsonian rats with or without dyskinetic symptoms after chronic L-DOPA administration. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based global metabolomics method combined with multivariate statistical analyses were used to detect candidate metabolites associated with LID. 36 dysregulated metabolites in the striatum of LID rats, including anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, adenosine, glutamate and sphingosine1-phosphate were identified. Furthermore, IMPaLA metabolite set analysis software was used to identify differentially regulated metabolic pathways. The results showed that the metabolic pathways of “Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling”, “Phospholipase D signaling pathway”, “Glycerophospholipid metabolism” and “Sphingolipid signaling”, etc. were dysregulated in LID rats compared to non-LID controls. Moreover, integrated pathway analysis based on results from the present metabolomics and our previous gene expression data in LID rats further demonstrates that aberrant “Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling” pathway might be involved in the development of LID. The present results provide a new profile for the understanding of the pathological mechanism of LID.

Abstract: This study analyzed the chemical components of sebum from Parkinson's disease patients and a healthy control group using headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC–MS). This method requires minimal sample amount, minimal sample preparation and no extensive equipment. The extraction efficiency of six commercially available fibers was thoroughly evaluated. Among these, a 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene coating emerged as the most effective for extracting key biomarkers: perillic aldehyde, eicosane, and octadecanal. To maximize the efficiency of the headspace solid-phase microextraction procedure, several critical parameters were optimized. These included extraction temperature and duration, as well as desorption temperature and time. This comprehensive optimization process ensured the most suitable conditions for biomarker extraction and analysis. The investigation included 80 subjects, comprising 28 healthy control group and 52 Parkinson's disease patients. The compounds perillic aldehyde, eicosane and octadecanal, which were first detected in this context by Trivedi et al. were investigated. Notably, perillic aldehyde was identified as potential biomarker, while eicosane and octadecanal showed no significant differences between the two groups. Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test confirmed significant differences for perillic aldehyde (p = 0.00154). Method validation demonstrated high precision and accuracy of measurements, with confirmed intraday and interday stability.

Allosteric regulation of the Golgi-localized PPM1H phosphatase by Rab GTPases modulates LRRK2 substrate dephosphorylation in Parkinson’s disease,

Abstract: PPM1H phosphatase reverses Parkinson’s disease-associated, Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2-mediated, Rab GTPase phosphorylation. We showed previously that PPM1H relies on an N-terminal amphipathic helix for Golgi membrane localization and this helix enables PPM1H to associate with liposomes in vitro; binding to highly curved liposomes activates PPM1H’s phosphatase activity. We show here that PPM1H also contains an allosteric binding site for its non-phosphorylated reaction products, Rab8A and Rab10. Microscale thermophoresis revealed that PPM1H binds thio-phosphorylated Rab8A at the active site with a KD of ∼1μM; binding of Rab8A and Rab10 to an alternative site is of similar affinity and is not detected for another LRRK2 substrate, Rab12. Non-phosphorylated Rab8A or Rab10 inhibit PPM1H phosphatase reactions at concentrations consistent with their measured binding affinities and fail to inhibit PPM1H L66R phosphatase reactions. Independent confirmation of non-phosphorylated Rab binding to PPM1H was obtained by sucrose gradient co-flotation of non-phosphorylated Rabs with liposome-bound PPM1H. Finally, Rab8A or Rab10 binding also requires PPM1H’s amphipathic helix, without which the interaction affinity is decreased about 6-fold. These experiments indicate that Golgi associated Rab proteins contribute to the localization of PPM1H and non-phosphorylated Rabs regulate PPM1H phosphatase activity via an allosteric site. Targeting this site could represent a strategy to enhance PPM1H-mediated dephosphorylation of LRRK2 substrates, offering a potential therapeutic approach to counteract LRRK2-driven Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is marked by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Emerging evidence highlights the critical involvement of neuronal ferroptosis and microglial pyroptosis in PD pathogenesis. In this study, we first characterized systemic inflammatory alterations in the peripheral blood of PD patients compared to healthy controls, revealing distinct pro-inflammatory signatures. Based on these findings, we engineered BV2 microglial membrane-camouflaged biomimetic multienzyme gallic acid-selenium nanoparticles (BM@GA-Se nanosomes) and evaluated their neuroprotective potential. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that BM@GA-Se nanosomes enhanced neuronal survival by simultaneously suppressing ferroptosis of neurons (via GPX4-mediated lipid peroxide reduction) and pyroptosis of microglia (through inhibition of the HSP90/NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway). These results position BM@GA-Se nanosome as a new dual-pathway targeting therapeutic strategy, offering a promising translational approach to mitigate PD progression by addressing interdependent inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms.

Abstract: Highly adaptable and reusable AI models are revolutionizing the diagnosis and management of Parkinson’s disease (PD). A wide range of AI algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning techniques, are now being employed for PD diagnosis and treatment. These algorithms leverage multimodal data, such as gait patterns, hand movements, and speech characteristics, to predict the likelihood of PD, evaluate symptom severity, facilitate early detection, and assess the effectiveness of treatments, demonstrating their advanced diagnostic potential. This paper provides a comprehensive review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for PD detection and assessment over the past decade, emphasizing their strengths, addressing their limitations, and exploring their potential to inspire new research directions. Additionally, it offers a curated collection of publicly available multimodal datasets focused on PD motor symptoms and validates the performance of these algorithms on privately collected datasets. Experimental results reveal that AI technologies for PD assessment have progressed from traditional methods to convolutional and sequential neural networks, and further to Transformer-based models, achieving consistently improving accuracy and establishing benchmarks for future advancements.

Abstract: Pain is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) that significantly impacts patients’ quality of life. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD has garnered considerable attention. However, the relationship between gut microbiota-induced changes in plasma metabolites and PD-associated pain remains poorly understood. To address this, we analyzed 64 PD patients with pain (PDP), 36 non-PD individuals with pain (nPDP), and 50 healthy controls (HC). Using 16S rDNA gene sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we characterized and compared the gut microbiota and plasma metabolite profiles across these groups. Additionally, correlation analyses were conducted to identify meaningful associations between microbial and metabolite data. Our findings revealed significant differences among the PDP, nPDP, and HC groups, particularly in taxa such as Bacteroidales, Gammaproteobacteria, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. KEGG function prediction indicated that bacterial colony function was primarily related to carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and energy metabolism. Plasma metabolomic analysis identified 16 differentially accumulated metabolites between the nPDP and PDP groups, with notable contributions from 12-ketodeoxycholic acid (12-KCAc), dihydroouabain (DHO), and lysophosphatidic acid (LysoPA). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was observed between LysoPA and Faecalibacterium, while 12-ketodeoxycholic acid exhibited a positive correlation with Clostridium and Romboutsia. This study suggests that PDP patients have distinct gut microbiota and metabolic profiles, which may contribute to the pain experience in PD patients. These divergent microbial and metabolite signatures may provide insight into potential mechanisms linking the gut-brain axis to pain in PD.

Abstract: In this research, we investigate gait differences between individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and healthy controls using the Timed Up-and-Go test. We created an application for MR devices, which enables the data acquisition from accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers allowing us to capture detailed kinematic data during the test, providing valuable insights into motor function and disease progression. The acquired data undergoes transformation into gait parameters, aiding in the differentiation of PD patients from healthy subjects through machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the study assesses the agreement between signals captured by the HL and those from a reference device to ensure measurement accuracy. Statistical analysis is applied to highlight gait parameters that exhibit significant differences between the analyzed groups. The classification metrics in distinguishing between PD and healthy subjects are reported. Best-performing classifier, Random Forest, achieves balanced accuracy = 81.2%, f1 score = 77.8%. This research is a significant advancement in the objective assessment of PD symptoms, mitigating the limitations associated with conventional clinical evaluations.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that results in the death of dopamine-producing neurons that mainly affects the motor cortex and causes such symptoms as tremors and difficulty speaking. White early treatments for PD included ablative and stereotactic surgeries, the precise destruction of specific brain structures, these lost favor with the emergence of levodopa in the second half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, the shortcomings of this drug, such as the reduced patient sensitivity to the treatment, sparked a new interest in surgical procedures, which in turn gave rise to the Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) technology. In this paper, we explore the history of PD treatments with a focus on DBS, as well as the developments and advancements of the technology, including innovations in software, hardware and targeting techniques. We highlight the state of the art of PD treatment and outline future possibilities in this field.

Abstract: The impact of cannabinoid CB2 receptor modulation on the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease remains unknown. We investigated the role of nigrostriatal CB2 receptors modulation in reversing alterations in sleep macrostructure, inter-hemispheric synchronization dynamics, and memory consolidation in the rotenone model of Parkinson's disease. Male Wistar rats (n = 65) underwent stereotaxic surgery for the administration of either rotenone (12 μg/μl) or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle, 10 % v/v) into the substantia nigra pars compacta. Seven days later, the rotenone-treated animals received intrastriatal injections of either dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle, 10 % v/v), GW405833 (partial agonist of CB2 receptors, 10 μg/μl), or AM630 (antagonist/inverse agonist of CB2 receptors, 3 μg/μl). One group of animals underwent 6 h of sleep-wake recording, while another group performed object recognition and open field tests. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted to determine striatal transcript levels of CB1 and CB2 receptors. Infusion of AM630 reversed the rotenone-induced alterations in sleep macrostructure and inter-hemispheric synchronization dynamics. This modulation led to increased sleep efficiency (p < 0.01), higher probability of shorter desynchronization events (p < 0.01), and reduced transition rate from synchronized to desynchronized states (p < 0.05). Conversely, GW405833, but not AM630, reversed the rotenone-induced impairment in object recognition memory (p < 0.01). No significant effects were observed on striatal cannabinoid receptors transcripts levels. These findings suggest that CB2 receptors modulation is associated with paradoxical outcomes in terms of non-motor signs of Parkinson's disease, indicating somewhat independent mechanisms underlying sleep and memory alterations in the rotenone model of the disease.

Abstract: Background
This study aimed to investigate neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) characteristics in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) across Parkinson's disease (PD) subtypes and their association with motor and cognitive performance.
Methods
Four groups were included: PD patients with mild motor predominant (PD-MMP, n = 37), intermediate (PD-IM, n = 41), diffuse malignant (PD-DM, n = 12), and healthy controls (HC, n = 51). Clinical evaluations and MRI scans were performed. Signal values from NM-MRI were extracted using SNc and background masks. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values for the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic territories of the SNc were compared across groups. Pearson correlations assessed the relationship between CNR values and clinical scores in PD patients.
Results
CNR values in the whole SNc differed significantly between groups (p < 0.01), with PD-DM showing the greatest reduction. The associative subregion had significantly lower CNR in all PD subgroups compared to HC (ps < 0.01). In the limbic subregion, PD-IM had lower CNR than PD-MMP (p = 0.04). In the sensorimotor subregion, PD-IM and PD-DM had lower CNR compared to HC (p < 0.01). CNR values in the whole SNc weakly correlated with UPDRS motor scores (r = −0.30, p < 0.01) and the Trail Making Test B (r = −0.27, p = 0.01).
Conclusions
Distinct neuromelanin alterations were observed across PD subtypes, with PD-DM showing the most significant NM loss. These findings suggest that regional NM loss is associated with motor and cognitive impairments, reflecting underlying pathological mechanisms in PD.

Abstract: Background
Celastrol (CEL), a bioactive compound isolated from Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook. F, exerts neuroprotective effects through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). CEL covalently binds to the thiol group of cysteine residues in cell division cycle 37 (CDC37), leading to redox-dependent modulation of CDC37 function. However, whether CEL redox regulates CDC37 and CEL-CDC37 interaction plays a role in pathogenesis of PD is still not be investigated yet. This study aids to demonstrate the role of CEL redox regulation of CDC37 in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD.
Methods
Lentiviral vectors were used to overexpress or knock down CDC37 in MPTP-injected mice. CEL was administered to assess its effect on CDC37 redox status and related molecular pathways.
Results
CDC37 overexpression alleviated MPTP-induced motor deficits and dopaminergic neuron loss, whereas CDC37 knockdown exacerbated these impairments. Overexpression of CDC37 also suppressed activation of the NF-κB pathway and reduced phosphorylation of α-synuclein at serine 129 (p-S129-syn). MPTP insult decreased the reduced (active) form of CDC37 due to oxidative stress. CEL treatment restored CDC37 redox status, improved locomotor performance, preserved dopaminergic neurons, and inhibited both NF-κB activation and p-S129-synuclein levels. These effects were mediated by CEL's redox regulation of CDC37, which prevented its overoxidation, disrupted the Hsp90/CDC37 complex, and suppressed downstream pro-inflammatory and pro-pathogenic signaling.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that CEL restores the protective role of CDC37 in the MPTP-injected Parkinson's disease (PD) mouse model via redox regulation of CDC37, which prevents over-oxidation of CDC37 under high oxidative stress, and disrupts the Hsp90/CDC37 complex and subsequently blocks NF-κB pathway activation and p-S129-synuclein production.

Abstract: Mucuna pruriens (MP), a natural source of L-DOPA, holds potential as a Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. This study developed two encapsulation systems for MP using nanocellulose (NC-MP) and nanocellulose-chitosan-tripolyphosphate (NCT-MP) to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The encapsulation process was performed via ultrasonication and characterized by FTIR, SEM, and TEM, revealing polydisperse spherical particles with sizes of 566.37 ± 37.41 nm (NC-MP) and 756.66 ± 51.44 nm (NCT-MP). The anti-parkinsonian effects were evaluated in a catalepsy-induced mouse model using the horizontal bar test. Both encapsulated systems significantly reduced catalepsy duration (∗p∗ < 0.001). NC-MP demonstrated superior efficacy at low doses (5–20 mg/kg), attributed to its smaller particle size and neutral charge, which may facilitate blood-brain barrier penetration. In contrast, NCT-MP showed enhanced effects at 25 mg/kg, likely due to chitosan's cationic charge promoting active transport and tripolyphosphate-mediated matrix stabilization. These findings highlight the potential of encapsulation systems to optimize MP's therapeutic profile, with formulation efficacy dependent on dosage requirements.

Abstract: Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the mammalian brain become increasingly quiescent with aging, which correlates to increased inflammatory signals in the SVZ. Targeting cells that secrete inflammatory signals, such as microglia, could potentially re-activate NSCs. In this study, we characterized CD11b–positive microglia isolated from post-mortem SVZ from non-demented control (Aged), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD) by single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing. Our transcriptome data revealed changes in gene signature in SVZ microglia from PD and AD, highlighting a disease-dependent response. Culture of iPSC-derived NSCs with supernatant from Aged, PD, and AD SVZ microglia showed an increase in proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the PD condition. Furthermore, we identified NR4A2, a transcription factor that promotes an anti-inflammatory microglia state, as a potential molecular mechanism that promotes a pro-neurogenic microglia phenotype. Altogether, our work identified a pro-neurogenic subpopulation of SVZ microglia that could be a novel target to promote repair in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects not only the brain but also the retina. Due to its anatomical and developmental similarities to the brain, the retina may serve as a non-invasive biomarker for the detection and monitoring of PD. This study aimed to investigate retinal structural changes and laboratory data in PD.
Method
A total of 125 patients with PD and 972 healthy controls from the PERSIAN Organizational Cohort Study were included in the analysis of macular and peripapillary OCT parameters, as well as laboratory test results. Group comparisons were performed using independent samples t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests. The associations between OCT measurements and age were evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient or Spearman’s rank correlation.
Results
Significant thinning of the perifoveal region was observed in PD patients, particularly in the superior (p = 0.042) and nasal (p = 0.021) quadrants and the superior hemisphere (p = 0.017) of the left eye, and in the temporal quadrant (p = 0.028) of the right eye. Additionally, optic disc area (p = 0.009) and focal loss volume (p < 0.001) were increased. Age-related reductions in Average pRNFL (p < 0.001) and GCC (p = 0.001) thickness were more pronounced in the PD group.
Conclusion
The significant reduction in perifoveal thickness and volume, along with a notable increase in optic nerve-related OCT parameters, may serve as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD. pRNFL, GCC, and perifoveal retinal thickness demonstrated a strong association with age in patients with PD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuronal degeneration and pathological α-synuclein accumulation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central feature in PD pathogenesis, contributing to impaired bioenergetics, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and defective organelle communication. This review synthesizes the current understanding of mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, including fission, fusion, mitophagy, and biogenesis, and their disruption in PD. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of intercellular mitochondrial transfer as a compensatory mechanism. Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondria can be transferred between neurons and glial cells through tunneling nanotubes, extracellular vesicles, and gap junctions, offering protective effects by restoring metabolic function and attenuating cellular stress. We examine the molecular mediators of these transfer pathways, the influence of PD-associated mutations, and the bidirectional dynamics between donor and recipient cells. Additionally, we explore translational strategies, including mitochondrial transplantation, bioengineered mitochondria, and stem cell-based delivery systems. While preclinical models demonstrate promising therapeutic outcomes, clinical translation faces challenges, including targeting specificity, mitochondrial viability, and immune compatibility. By integrating mechanistic insights with therapeutic developments, this review highlights mitochondrial transfer as a novel and promising approach in the future treatment of PD, potentially addressing longstanding limitations in conventional neuroprotective strategies.

Abstract: Background
It remains a challenge to accurately differentiate progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate the value of multimodal MRI biomarkers assessed by a single 3D multi-echo magnetization transfer contrast gradient echo (3D ME-MTC-GRE) sequence in the differential diagnosis of PSP from PD.
Methods
Seventy-three PD patients, 32 PSP patients, and 36 age - and sex-matched healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. MRI examinations were performed at a 3.0 T MRI scanner. The midbrain to pons ratio (MPR) was measured in the midsagittal T1-weighted imaging. Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI and quantitative susceptibility mapping were simultaneously obtained by a single 3D ME-MTC-GRE sequence. Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) volume and the red nucleus (RN) susceptibility were analyzed and compared among three groups by a single 3D ME-MTC-GRE sequence. The diagnostic performance of these biomarkers was assessed by areas under curves (AUCs).
Results
The PSP group exhibited the smallest MPR and SNpc volume and the highest RN susceptibility compared with the other two groups. The PD group also showed a smaller SNpc volume than HC group. The MPR, SNpc volume, and RN susceptibility on their own differentiated PSP from PD with AUCs of 0.875, 0.883, and 0.892, respectively. The model consisting of SNpc volume and RN susceptibility, as well as the model consisting of these three biomarkers, demonstrated better diagnostic performance in distinguishing PSP from PD patients, with AUCs of 0.928 and 0.939, respectively.
Conclusion
The multimodal MRI biomarkers offer a more comprehensive understanding of PSP and PD patients from both morphological and pathological perspectives. By combining these MRI biomarkers, it may have the potential to promote reliable MRI-based identification of PSP and PD patients, and facilitate more accurate clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: Diminished facial expression, a hallmark symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly impacts non-verbal communication and social interactions. This study explores the use of temporal facial variability (TVV) as a objective measure for motor impairment severity in de-novo PD patients. A cohort of 42 participants performed structured speech tasks, and their facial dynamics were captured using high-resolution 3D sensors. Advanced geometric and statistical analyses, including radial curve tensors and temporal volume variation metrics, were applied to quantify facial muscle activity. Clustering and regression analyses revealed a significant association between TVV and UPDRS Part III scores, with lower facial variability correlating with greater motor impairment. The findings suggest that temporal volume variability (TVV) may serve as a promising non-invasive marker to assist in the early detection and monitoring of Parkinson's disease. This structured speech task methodology could potentially complement existing clinical tools, contributing to improved diagnostic precision.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Valid non-invasive biomarkers for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Parkinson-plus syndrome (PPS) are urgently needed. Based on our recent self-supervised vision foundation model the Shift Window UNET TRansformer (Swin UNETR), which uses clinical multi-contrast whole brain MRI, we aimed to develop an efficient and practical model (‘SwinClassifier’) for the discrimination of PD vs PPS using routine clinical MRI scans.
Methods
We used 75,861 clinical head MRI scans including T1-weighted, T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging as a pre-training dataset to develop a foundation model, using self-supervised learning with a cross-contrast context recovery task. Then clinical head MRI scans from n = 1992 participants with PD and n = 1989 participants with PPS were used as a downstream PD vs PPS classification dataset. We then assessed SwinClassifier’s performance in confusion matrices compared to a comparative self-supervised vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) autoencoder (‘ViTClassifier’), and to two convolutional neural networks (DenseNet121 and ResNet50) trained from scratch.
Findings
SwinClassifier showed very good performance (F1 score 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.79–0.87], AUC 0.89) in PD vs PPS discrimination in independent test datasets (n = 173 participants with PD and n = 165 participants with PPS). This self-supervised classifier with pretrained weights outperformed the ViTClassifier and convolutional classifiers trained from scratch (F1 score 0.77–0.82, AUC 0.83–0.85). Occlusion sensitivity mapping in the correctly-classified cases (n = 160 PD and n = 114 PPS) highlighted the brain regions guiding discrimination mainly in sensorimotor and midline structures including cerebellum, brain stem, ventricle and basal ganglia.
Interpretation
Our self-supervised digital model based on routine clinical head MRI discriminated PD vs PPS with good accuracy and sensitivity. With incremental improvements the approach may be diagnostically useful in early disease.

Abstract: Introduction
Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) vary markedly in terms of non-motor symptoms (NMS) as the disease progresses. To improve PD management and clinical-trial assessment, we aimed to determine NMS endotypes in a cohort of patients with advanced PD.
Methods
We conducted an ancillary cluster analysis of the 2013–2018 cohort (n = 722) of PREDISTIM. In this French multicenter interventional cohort, consecutive candidates for subthalamic deep brain stimulation undergo thorough assessment of motor symptoms (MS) and NMS at the inclusion visit. The NMS data are based on the MDS-UPDRS, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and several psychiatric scales: Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), and Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS). Cluster analysis with 17 NMS was conducted to identify groups with homogenous NMS profiles.
Results
Three distinct NMS clusters were identified. The largest had mild MS. The smallest had moderate MS and the most severe NMS, including cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction. The middle-large group had moderate MS and NMS but was distinguished by having the worst sleeping problems. The clusters did not differ in onset age or patient age and may be underpinned by disparate patterns of anatomical brain damage.
Conclusion
The mainly-motor (Cluster 1), mainly non-motor (Cluster 3), and intermediate (Cluster 2) NMS endophenotypes must be replicated in an independent cohort but may help stratify patients for management (pharmacological, deep-brain stimulation, and non-pharmacological treatments) and inclusion and assessment in clinical trials.

Abstract: Background
People with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) who have undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery have been historically excluded from rehabilitation clinical trials.
Objective
This project investigated the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a dual-task training intervention aimed at improving postural instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD) in PwPD with DBS.
Methods
Symptoms of PIGD were measured with the 2-Minute Walk Test (2MWT) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test under single- and dual-task conditions.
Results
Five participants completed 97.5 % of the 16 intervention sessions without serious adverse events. One participant was excluded from the motor analysis due to frequent changes in DBS settings. Of the four participants included in the analysis, all demonstrated improvement in the TUG under single- and dual-task conditions. During the 2MWT, two participants experienced an improvement in gait speed under single-task conditions, and three experienced an improvement under dual-task conditions.
Conclusion
Initial data suggest dual-task training is safe and feasible for PwPD with DBS. Having DBS presents unique challenges including advanced motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and potential changes in DBS parameters, that impact intervention delivery, adherence, and outcomes. Despite unique challenges, appropriately selected PwPD with DBS have the capacity to improve PIGD symptoms with dual-task training. To facilitate generalizability across the PD continuum, future rehabilitation trials including PwPD with DBS are justified and recommended.

Abstract: Summary
With over 10 million people affected worldwide, Parkinson's disease is the fastest-growing neurological disorder. More than two-thirds of people with Parkinson's disease live with chronic pain, which can manifest in various stages of the disease, substantially affecting daily activities and quality of life. The Parkinson's disease Pain Classification System overcomes the limitations of previous classification systems by distinguishing between pain related to Parkinson's disease and unrelated pain, while also incorporating clinical and pathophysiological (mechanistic) descriptors such as nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain. This system provides a framework for accurate diagnosis and mechanism-based therapy. Alongside the appropriate classification of pain, consideration of treatment approaches that include non-invasive (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and invasive strategies tailored to specific types of pain will refine and inform research trials and clinical practice when it comes to treating pain in Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: This review assesses the roles of GLP-1 and its receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in the treatment of diabetes and Parkinson’s disease, integrating current theories and research. GLP-1, a vital endogenous hormone, regulates insulin secretion, delays gastric emptying, and promotes satiety, showing significant potential for diabetes management. However, its brief lifespan and restricted blood-brain barrier penetration limit its clinical application. To overcome these constraints, researchers have developed GLP-1 receptor agonists that prolong its action and exhibit high efficacy in diabetes treatment. Recent studies further reveal GLP-1’s neuroprotective effects, notably its potential in managing neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. GLP-1RAs mitigate neuroinflammation, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance neuroprotection, suggesting substantial potential for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, to enhance GLP-1RAs’ efficacy in the nervous system, researchers have introduced novel drug delivery approaches, including nanoparticle carriers and molecular modifications, to improve stability and targeting accuracy. In conclusion, this review comprehensively analyzes the mechanisms, clinical applications, and challenges of GLP-1 and its receptor agonists in managing diabetes and Parkinson’s disease, while identifying future research and clinical opportunities.

Abstract: Object
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with different subtypes. More accurate subtype classification is significant for understanding the pathogenesis of PD, predicting disease progression, and selecting effective treatment methods. A bibliometric analysis of relevant research on PD subtypes is presented in this study.
Methods
Original research and review articles related to PD subtypes from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. After screening, 2213 articles were obtained. Statistical analysis and visualization of country, institution, author, journal, and keyword information contained in the studies were performed using CiteSpace (v6.2. R4) and VOSviewer (v1.6.20.0) software to identify research hotspots and trends in the field.
Result
The 2213 articles used in this study were from 11740 authors from 3117 institutions in 93 countries and published in 481 journals. From the analysis, it was found that the number of annual publications in this field has been increasing year by year in the past 10 years. The United States contributed the most to this research direction, with the largest number of publications (604) and citations (31, 284), and the strongest connection with other countries. 'Motor disorder ' is the most frequently cited journal, and ' Parkinson 's disease-related disorder ' is the most frequently published journal. "Parkinson's Disease", "Dementia", "Subtypes", and "Progress" are frequently used keywords, while "Rem sleep", "networs", and "machine learning" are the focus of research in recent years.
Conclusion
The bibliometric analysis offers a comprehensive insight into present research focal points and evolving patterns associated with PD subtypes. High-frequency keywords pinpointed underscore dynamic research fields encompassing methodologies, mechanisms, and engaged populations. These findings can provide guidance for future research on PD subtypes.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and its molecular mechanism, and to establish an evaluation model for corneal nerve fiber injury. The function and mechanism of α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease were studied. The expression level of α-synuclein in corneal tissues of Parkinson's disease patients and normal control group was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. At the same time, the morphological changes of corneal nerve fibers were observed by confocal microscopy, and the degree of corneal nerve injury was evaluated by corneal synesthetic nerve function test. The results showed that the expression level of α-synuclein in the corneal tissue of patients with Parkinson's disease was significantly increased, and the morphology and function of corneal nerve fibers were significantly abnormal. Corneal synesthetic nerve function test results also showed that the corneal sensory nerve conduction speed slowed down and sensitivity decreased in patients with Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Objective
This study aimed to investigate the effects of combining repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) with home-based exercise (HB) over 10 sessions and examined locomotion outcomes over 8 weeks in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Methods
Thirty-nine individuals with mild to moderate PD were randomly assigned to real rTMS combined with HB (real rTMS + HB), sham rTMS combined with HB (sham rTMS + HB), and a control group. The intervention groups received 10 sessions of rTMS alongside an 8-week HB program.
Results
Significant improvements (p < 0.05) were found in both intervention groups over time for clinical outcomes and turning characteristics compared to the control group. No significant clinical or kinematic differences were observed between the real and sham rTMS + HB groups. Only the real rTMS + HB group showed reduced motor-evoked potential amplitude after 10 sessions and at 8-week follow-up.
Conclusion
Home-based exercise improved locomotion in individuals with PD. Although real rTMS modified cortical excitability, it did not provide additional clinical or kinematic benefits beyond home-based exercise alone.
Significance
The combination of rTMS combined with home-based exercise may influence cortical excitability; however, locomotion improvements in individuals with PD appear to be primarily driven by home-based exercise, and the neuromodulatory role of rTMS warrants further investigation.

It aims to assess the therapeutic potential of epigenetic phenomena, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, and to discuss how these molecular mechanisms can be integrated into disease-modifying strategies. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of the roles of these epigenetic factors in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis and their therapeutic applications. We investigate the role of DNA methylation in regulating key genes such as SNCA, explore the potential of histone modifications as neuroprotective agents through HDAC inhibition, and examine how non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs, can modulate Parkinson's disease-related pathways. We also compare various strategies, emphasizing their unique benefits and challenges. This review summarizes current studies on epigenetic therapies for Parkinson's disease, emphasizing significant gaps in therapeutic specificity and delivery. Ultimately, we present a roadmap for future research aimed at overcoming these obstacles to promote the development of more effective, disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Background
Previous cross-sectional work has suggested that higher cognitive reserve (CR) is associated with better cognitive performance and slower cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, these findings need confirmation in prospective longitudinal designs. The current study therefore examined how CR influences both cognitive function and the rate of cognitive deterioration in a longitudinal PD cohort.
Methods
This study utilized a prospective, longitudinal design and recruited participants from Tianjin Huanhu Hospital between September 2017–September 2019. PD patients were followed up for clinical assessment at an average of 2 ± 0.6 years.
Results
Higher CR levels were associated with better cognitive performance and reduced cognitive decline over a 2-year follow-up period. Linear regression analysis revealed significant positive associations between CR and the 2-year change rate of Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scores, with age and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype being significant predictors. Logistic regression indicated that CR Index (CRI) components (education, working activity, and leisure time) and intelligence quotient (IQ) were independently associated with cognitive decline risk.
Conclusions
The study highlights the importance of CR in mitigating cognitive decline in PD and suggests that interventions to enhance CR could be beneficial for PD patients. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms and developing targeted interventions to support cognitive health in PD.

Abstract: Organophosphorus flame retardant TDCPP, a substitute for brominated flame retardants, is widely used in consumer products but readily leaches into the environment, posing human exposure risks. This study investigated the neurotoxic mechanisms of TDCPP in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Using an MPTP-induced PD mouse model, TDCPP exposure exacerbated behavioral deficits, reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra, and amplified neuroinflammation characterized by enhanced microglial reactivity, elevated pro-inflammatory IFN-γ, and diminished anti-inflammatory IL-4 and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Concurrently, TDCPP lowered glutathione (GSH) levels and altered ferroptosis-related protein expression, indicating oxidative stress involvement. In SH-SY5Y cells, co-treatment with TDCPP and MPTP caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and shifted microglia into a pro-inflammatory state—evidenced by increased CD86 expression—and impaired their phagocytic clearance of α-synuclein. These findings demonstrate that TDCPP aggravates PD neurodegeneration through dual mechanisms: ferroptosis-linked oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. This study provides the first evidence linking TDCPP exposure to ferroptosis-mediated neurotoxicity in PD models, bridging environmental toxicology and neurodegenerative research. The results underscore the role of environmental pollutants in PD progression and offer critical insights for refining safety regulations to mitigate human health risks.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor impairments such as bradykinesia and rigidity, and non-motor deficits including anxiety. These phenomena are closely associated with underlying pathological processes including oxidative stress(OS) and mitochondrial dysfunction that arise from the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Recent studies have shown that flavonoids like quercetin have neuroprotective effects through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of quercetin on motor function, anxiety-like behaviors, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in hippocampal dentate gyrus tissue in a rat model of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and examine the behavioral findings with the use of two doses (10 and 25 mg/kg) of quercetin. Forty male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: control, sham, Parkinson's, and two quercetin-treated PD groups (10 and 25 mg/kg), and 6-OHDA (8 μg/3 μl) was injected into the left medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in three of them to induce PD. The behavioral assessments evaluated motor function and anxiety-like behaviors, including apomorphine-induced rotation, rotarod, wire hanging, elevated plus maze, and open field tests. Our results indicate that quercetin treatment significantly reduced apomorphine-induced rotations, supporting the results of rotarod and wire hanging tests, improved motor coordination, with the 25 mg/kg dose showing greater efficacy. Quercetin also alleviated anxiety-like behaviors in a dose-dependent manner based on the results of the elevated plus maze and open field tests. In addition, the results showed a significant elevation of IL-6 in the hippocampus of PD rats compared to the control group, and quercetin treatment can reduce its levels, though the levels remained higher than in the sham and control groups. These findings suggest that quercetin ameliorates both motor and anxiety-like deficits in a 6-OHDA rat model of Parkinson’s disease, potentially through modulation of hippocampal neuro-inflammation, highlighting its promise as a multi-target therapeutic agent in PD.

Abstract: Objectives
To examine the effects of dual-task training on gait variability in individuals with Parkinson's disease.
Design
This is a single-blind, randomized controlled trial.
Methods
This study recruited 28 individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and 26 datasets were analyzed. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (dual-task training) or the control group (treadmill training). Both groups completed 16 training sessions over 8 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-intervention. Primary outcomes measured spatiotemporal gait variability in the less and more affected lower extremities.
Results
Significant time × group interactions were observed in bilateral step length variability during cognitive dual-task walking and in step length variability of the more affected side during motor dual-task walking and single walking. Significant time × group interactions were found in double and single support times during cognitive and motor dual-task walking. The experimental group demonstrated significant improvements in step length variability, step length, and single and double support times across both dual-task and single walking conditions.
Conclusions
Compared to treadmill training alone, dual-task training improved gait stability during dual-task walking, as indicated by reduced step length variability, decreased double support time, and increased single support time. These improvements were most notable in the spatial parameters of gait and primarily observed on the more affected side. Clinical trial registration: The study was prospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT03623841).

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The pathophysiology of PD is complex and multifactorial involving genetic factors, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired protein clearance, and neuroinflammation but recent evidence emphasizes the role of impaired brain insulin signaling. Insulin is a metabolic hormone with extensive effects on metabolic substrates but recent studies have demonstrated that it is also involved in central signaling pathways and induces different brain areas related to food craving, motor activities, cognitive abilities, and emotional feelings. Hence, it has been suggested that induction of brain insulin sensitivity may be a promising treatment for PD. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics are a new-generation class of antidiabetics that normalize glucose homeostasis via several pathways. Recent studies suggest extra-glycemic benefits for GLP-1 mimetics against PD. GLP-1 mimetics can prevent or slow PD progression. Additionally, these agents can improve cognitive functions by improving brain insulin signaling pathways. In this review, we aim to highlight the role of brain insulin signaling in PD pathophysiology and discuss the possible benefits of GLP-1 mimetics in PD management.

Abstract: Background
Early-phase F-18 FP-CIT PET/CT (PETFP-CIT) has been reported to possibly replace FDG PET/CT (PETFDG) in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism. We investigated the correlation between PETFP-CIT and PETFDG to explore their potential interchangeability.
Method
Our retrospective study included 187 participants, categorized into Parkinson's disease (PD), atypical parkinsonian disorders (APD), and participants with intact dopamine transporters (DATintact). We analyzed the correlation of standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) from early-phase PETFP-CIT and PETFDG scans across 23 different brain volumes-of-interest using Pearson's correlation analysis. We conducted this analysis for all participants collectively and then separately for each group.
Results
For all participants without grouping, a moderate correlation (with correlation coefficients R ranging from 0.360 in right putamen to 0.530 in left caudate nucleus) was observed between Early-phase PETFP-CIT and PETFDG. PD group showed a weak to moderate correlation (0.226 in left frontal cortex ≤ R ≤ 0.555 in right cerebellum). APD group revealed a moderate correlation with R ranging from 0.488 in right cerebellum to 0.692 in right occipital cortex. Conversely, a lack of correlation in specific areas for DATintact group indicated distinctions between the modalities.
Conclusions
Our study showed interchangeability with a moderate correlation between early-phase PETFP-CIT and PETFDG. However, careful consideration is needed for DATintact group.

Abstract: Background
Differentiating Essential Tremor and Parkinson's Disease is challenging due to overlapping tremor characteristics, including similar frequency ranges (4–8 Hz) and kinetic manifestations that defy conventional clinical differentiation. This study aimed to develop a multiclass differentiation system for Essential Tremor, Parkinson's Disease, and Healthy Controls by employing deep learning to decode distinct biomechanical patterns from multi-sensor movement data during dynamic motor tasks.
Methods
Tremor severity was assessed using accelerometers positioned on the thumb, index finger, metacarpal, and wrist during four protocols: two static (rest, postural) and two dynamic (free motion, motion with object). We employed a Transformer-based model with multi-head attention to capture spatiotemporal movement patterns. Two analytical approaches were compared: (1) feature extraction followed by Transformer processing, and (2) direct Transformer processing of raw signals.
Findings
The feature-based approach achieved perfect classification accuracy (100 %) for postural holding (utilizing integrated absolute value and other derived features) and free motion (employing mean power and additional features). The raw signal approach similarly attained 100 % accuracy in classifying free motion (200-sample window) and motion with object (200- and 300-sample windows). Integration of multi-protocol dynamic tasks (free motion and motion with object) yielded 99.32 % overall accuracy. Crucially, dynamic protocols demonstrated consistent superiority over static protocols in diagnostic performance.
Interpretation
The Transformer model with multi-head attention effectively identified disease-specific biomechanical patterns. Its high accuracy in distinguishing Essential Tremor, Parkinson's Disease, and Healthy Control participants, particularly during dynamic tasks, positions it as a promising tool for enhancing clinical decision-making and artificial intelligence-assisted monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest growing neurodegenerative movement disorder. It is characterized by both motor and non-motor, including neuropsychiatric disturbances such as depression and anxiety. The locus coeruleus (LC), a small nucleus in the brainstem, plays a key role in these symptoms and has white matter connections to the thalamus. This study aims to investigate this LC-thalamic tract in PD patients using ultra-high-field diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and to examine its relationship with non-motor symptoms.
Methods
100 participants, including 69 early-stage PD and 31 healthy control (HC) participants were evaluated using several questionnaires and a 7T diffusion MRI scan. Tractography was performed to reconstruct the LC-thalamic white matter tract, and diffusion parameters (FA, MD, AD, RD) were analysed.
Results
PD patients showed significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in the white matter tissue compared to HC, indicating reduced white matter integrity.
Discussion
This study shows the feasibility to visualize the LC-thalamic tract with the use of 7T DWI data. The results provide evidence of the association between the integrity of the white matter tracts and early PD development, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of the LC and its white matter connections in the progression of PD and neuropsychiatric and other symptoms.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions. The pathogenesis of PD was thought to involve mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. In this study, PD was induced in zebrafish models, and the effectiveness of MS01 sponge extract in neuroprotective effects was assessed. In zebrafish models, rotenone was treated, MS01-mixed pellets were fed, sensitivity and motor function were tested, and the fish were euthanized. Histopathology and fluorescent microscopy images of the zebrafish brain were then analyzed. Gene expression study was performed to analyze the expression of the PINK1 and Parkin genes. The compound xenin identified by LC-MS/MS analysis was selected for in silico studies. Using molecular docking and modeling techniques, the gene expression of PINK1 and Parkin was also investigated. The analysis showed binding of the xenin peptide to the PINK1-ubiquitin complex may enhance the stability of the complex and increase the production of parkin, which reduces PD symptoms. This demonstrates the neuroprotective effects of the xenin peptide.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a significant global health challenge, affecting millions worldwide. This sub-study aims to explore the potential of ambulatory monitoring devices in identifying disease severity and progression in patients. As part of the MOMOPA-EC clinical trial, 156 patients with moderate to severe PD underwent 435 assessments using clinical scales and ambulatory monitoring devices (Parkinson’s Holter). This sub-study seeks to establish relations between parameters derived from Holter monitors and clinical severity measures to enhance personalized disease management strategies. Methods: In the MOMOPA-EC trial, 435 patient monitoring sessions were conducted, during which patients wore Parkinson’s Holter monitors for a week before completing clinical assessments, including the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FoG-Q). Results: The reports obtained during the monitoring of the patients were classified into three groups based on the greater or lesser gait fluidity (according to the measurements from the Parkinson’s Holter). All clinical scales were significantly different in each of these groups, indicating that patients with lower stride fluidity had poorer outcomes across the different clinical scales. Conclusions: The findings of this study underscore the potential of Parkinson’s Holters in providing objective data for personalized disease management in PD patients. Integrating such technologies into routine clinical practice could enhance patient care and treatment strategies by offering clinicians objective insights into both disease progression and therapeutic response.

Abstract: Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, leading to a significant decline in striatal dopamine levels. This study aims to systematically analyze alterations in striatal metabolites across different stages of PD to identify potential biomarkers, elucidate pathological mechanisms, and explore therapeutic targets.
Methods
A total of 72 mice were divided into six groups, including one control group and five PD model groups (W1–W5, representing distinct stages based on the duration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/probenecid induction). Striatal tissues were comprehensively collected, and small-molecule metabolites were detected using metabolomics techniques. Potential differential metabolite biomarkers were screened through variable importance in projection values from orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and coefficient values from LASSO ordinal logistic regression.
Results
Thirteen potential differential metabolites were identified, including Ergocalciferol, Glutaric acid, Etilefrine, and Guanine, among others. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that purine metabolism emerged as the most significantly perturbed pathway. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the biomarker panel composed of these 13 metabolites effectively distinguished different stages of PD.
Conclusion
The striatum exhibits distinct metabolic profiles at different stages of PD, with purine metabolism showing the most pronounced alterations. The characteristic metabolites and metabolic pathways identified in this study contribute to elucidating the pathophysiological features of PD and may guide precision therapy.

Abstract: Objective: The role of bilateral cortical inhibition in motor compensation during the progression of early Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the dynamic balance of between-hemispheric inhibition and the clinical relevance of its neurophysiological indicators. Methods: Paired-pulse TMS was used to investigate the activity of different intracortical inhibitory circuits in 90 PD patients and 43 healthy controls during the “on medication” state. Spearman's rank correlations and general linear model (GLM) were used to analyze the association between TMS measures and disease severity, while receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to identify the best indicator to predict disease progression at 12 months. Results: As PD advances, both cross-sectional and longitudinal study confirm the difference in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) increase while long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) tends to decrease, leading to a rising difference in the ratio of SICI differences and LICI differences between the two hemispheres (SICI’/LICI’). The SICI’/LICI’ reflecting the variation represents motor reserve capacity between hemisphere in some extent. Furthermore, GLM revealed that the change of SICI’/LICI’ ratio was longitudinally correlated with the deterioration of motor and non-motor symptoms over time. Finally, ROC analysis validated the change of SICI’/LICI’ as a potential predictor of PD progression. Conclusions: The present study has shown that the dysfunction of inhibitory pathway was correlated with disease severity and progression. Also, the change of SICI’/LICI’ ratio was a valuable tool for assessing the dynamic changes in cortical compensation mechanisms as well as PD progression.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent age-related neurodegenerative condition that develops gradually and is observed in around 1 % of the elderly population. Lately, there has been an increasing curiosity about the possibilities of phyto-components for the treatment of PD due to their rich array of active compounds, notably antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents.
Objective
Our objective was to assess the impact of an ethanolic extract from Dombeya wallichii, which has antioxidant properties, on the Parkinsonian rat's model.
Material and methods
Rats received 10 mg/kg paraquat to assess its antiparkinsonian effects. They were treated with ethanolic extract of Dombeya wallichii (200, 400, 600 mg/kg) for 21 days, 1 h after paraquat. Behavioral aspects were evaluated before sacrifice. On day 22, rats were euthanized, and their bodies examined for changes in antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione, malondialdehyde, catalase), neurotransmitter levels (dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, acetylcholinesterase), mRNA expression and neuroinflammatory cytokines (Interleukin-1β, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, nuclear factor kappa B, Interleukin-6).
Results
The ethanolic extract of Dombeya wallichii reduced paraquat-induced motor deficits in the rotarod, hole board, akinesia, and forelimb hanging tests. It also improved biochemical and neuroinflammatory markers by lowering oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines, showing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. q-RT-PCR revealed that D. wallichii downregulated α-synuclein, Interleukin-1β, nuclear factor kappa B, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, while mRNA expression indicated neuroprotection.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that Dombeya wallichii could be a viable candidate for Parkinson's disease treatment, owing to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

Abstract: Introduction
Subthalamic (STN) local field potentials (LFP) in the beta band are considered potential biomarkers for closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies focusing on chronic STN LFP modulation in response to stimulation and treatment are scant. Deepening knowledge on beta modulation during chronic stimulation could aid the development of solid computational algorithm for adaptive DBS. This study aimed to investigate: 1) the presence of beta peaks in the first 21 patients receiving the Percept PC at our Tertiary Centre; 2) the influence of medications, stimulation, and plasma levodopa levels on beta-peaks magnitude and motor performances.
Methods
Twenty-one (19 males, 2 females) consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS surgery were prospectively recruited. At 6 months after surgery, an extensive and systematic evaluation of raw LFP, motor performances, and plasma levodopa levels was conducted in the following four conditions: OFF-medications/ON-stimulation; OFF-medications/OFF-stimulation; ON-medications/OFF-stimulation; ON-medications/ON-stimulation.

Analysis of STN LFP revealed that 76.2 % (16/21) of PD patients showed a beta peak. Beta peaks was identified at an average frequency of 21.0 ± 5.4 Hz, with an amplitude of 1.1 ± 0.8 μV/rtHz. A higher significant reduction of beta STN oscillations was observed following stimulation activation (p < 0.001) compared to levodopa administration. LFP amplitude patterns reflected motor performance trends across the four treatment conditions.
Conclusion
This study provides a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of LFP behaviour in response to stimulation and medication, conducted during ongoing stimulation and in the chronic state. These findings enhance understanding of beta oscillatory changes related to therapies and stimulation.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by heterogeneous symptoms and long disease progression and requires individualized treatment. This study aimed to elucidate large-scale herbal medicine patterns according to age, duration of disease progression, and various detailed symptoms of PD, as well as examine comorbidities to build a basis for clinical applications.
Methods
We analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance System cohort database regarding patients with PD who received herbal medicines between 2014 and 2020. We identified 10,060 patients with various prescription patterns based on age and PD duration. Additionally, to estimate the potential therapeutic mechanisms of insured herbal medicines for the clinical symptoms of PD, we conducted a literature review of the results of clinical and preclinical studies.
Results
The overall insurance-covered herbal medicine prescriptions for patients with PD had increased in both the number of prescriptions and patients over time. The herbal medicine use rate in patients with PD was the highest between ages 70 and 79 years and within 3 years of PD onset. Doinseunggi-tang, Haengso-tang, and Palmul-tang were the most frequently used herbal medicines. The most common comorbidities diagnosed along with PD were musculoskeletal and digestive diseases.
Conclusion
Some insurance-covered herbal medicines are frequently used among patient groups in a specific age group or duration of disease, and our literature review indicates a correlation between the mechanism of action of these herbal medicines and a specific subgroup of patients with PD. To validate these results and draw meaningful conclusions that reflect the realities of Korean medicine clinical practice, including non-reimbursed treatments, further prospective large-scale clinical trials considering age and disease progression duration are required.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration and α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra. Melatonin, a widely used neuroregulatory hormone, has shown potential in treating PD, while its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of melatonin (MT) in a paraquat-induced rat model of Parkinson's disease, focusing on oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our findings revealed that paraquat (PQ) induced damage to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, accompanied by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment with MT alleviated PQ-induced oxidative stress, preserved mitochondrial function, and protected dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 suppressed the expression of Nrf2 and disrupted the neuroprotective effects of MT. We propose that MT activates Nrf2 via the PI3K/AKT pathway to protect mitochondria and reduce oxidative stress. Our results suggest that the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 pathway plays a crucial role in the neuroprotective effects of melatonin in Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Targeting the gut-brain axis, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has become a cutting-edge therapeutic strategy for treating Parkinson's disease (PD), reducing both motor and non-motor symptoms. With an emphasis on gut microbiota changes, disease progression, and symptom alleviation, this systematic review assesses the safety and effectiveness of FMT in PD patients. Four RCTs, one observational research, one non-randomized control study, one case series, and one case report were among the eight papers that were considered; these studies comprised 144 patients in total. Key findings show that FMT has a good safety profile with only mild to severe adverse effects observed, and it significantly improves PD symptoms, notably constipation. Colonic, Nasointestinal, and oral administration were among the delivery routes used to assess treatment effectiveness using the MDS-UPDRS scale. The research reveals differences in the makeup of microbiota and emphasizes how FMT may affect the gut-brain axis, hence resolving neurological abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. Small sample numbers, variations in FMT methods, and the absence of long-term follow-up data are some of the limitations. This study highlights FMT's potential as an adjunctive treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in improving patient quality of life and reducing non-motor symptoms. To provide standardized procedures and validate long-term safety and effectiveness, bigger multicentre trials are necessary.

Abstract: Synaptic dysfunction exists before symptoms occur in Parkinson’s disease, and restoring synaptic function as a promising therapeutic approach. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor serves as a key neuroregulatory factor in regulating synaptic function. Studies have shown that the protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor is low in Parkinson’s disease mice. However, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can mitigate this decline. We explored the protective role of rTMS on brain-derived neurotrophic factor and synaptic function in a mouse Parkinson’s disease model. The bioinformatics analysis further confirmed the regulation of synaptic function. Behavioral tests, Western blot tests, and immunofluorescence were performed. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine mouse model, low, medium, and high frequency magnetic stimulation were used at the same time, and we found that only the high frequency group improved dopaminergic neuron loss and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Meanwhile, high frequency rTMS treatment alleviated motor dysfunction by alleviating the loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. In addition, high frequency treatment induced the phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and cAMP response element-binding protein, but the total protein level did not change significantly. After further use of KN93 antagonism, it was observed that P- Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, P-cAMP response element-binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and synapse-related protein expression were decreased, and rTMS protection was no longer effective. Therefore, rTMS therapy may upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor through the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-cAMP response element-binding protein pathway, improve synaptic function, and protect dopaminergic neurons, thereby enhancing motor function.

Abstract: Objectives
This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Cassia Oil (CO)-based fragrance therapy in alleviating winter-aggravated mood disorders (including depression and anxiety) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, specifically assessing its effects on improving sleep quality and reducing fatigue-key comorbid symptoms often exacerbated in winter. Additionally, it sought to verify whether this non-pharmacological intervention could serve as a viable complementary strategy for managing seasonal symptom fluctuations in PD.
Methods
Eighty PD patients were randomized to receive CO inhalation therapy (2 h/day, 5 days/week for 8 weeks; n = 40) or standard care (n = 40). Outcomes included mood (Hamilton Depression Scale [HAMD], Hamilton Anxiety Scale [HAMA]), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), fatigue (Fatigue Scale-14 [FS-14]). Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-treatment.
Results
The intervention group demonstrated significant reductions in HAMD (22.08±5.43 vs. 13.65±2.73, p < 0.01) and HAMA scores (17.63±4.50 vs. 12.23±0.53, p < 0.001), with no changes in controls (HAMD: 22.87±6.03 to 23.38±5.66, p = 0.72; HAMA: 16.93±3.87 to 15.95±4.55, p = 0.31). PSQI total scores improved significantly in the intervention group (12.20±3.09 to 0.83±0.96, p < 0.01), particularly in subjective sleep quality (t = 6.55, p < 0.01) and sleep latency (t = 5.46, p < 0.01).
Conclusion
CO-based fragrance therapy effectively improved mood, sleep quality, and fatigue in PD patients during winter, offering a novel non-pharmacological approach for seasonal symptom management.

Abstract: Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology is associated with a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and accumulation of insoluble inclusions of misfolded alpha-synuclein. In this study, we used a neuroblastoma-derived cell model overexpressing a pro-aggregation form of alpha-synuclein and human-derived induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate the efficacy of PIKfyve-mediated lysosomal biogenesis to reduce alpha-synuclein inclusions.
Methods
We used high-content imaging and enzymatic assays to follow the progression of lysosomal biogenesis, lysosomal catabolism and alpha-synuclein accumulation. The cell models used recapitulated important elements of the biochemical phenotype observed in PD dopaminergic neurons, including alpha-synuclein inclusions and impaired glucocerebrosidase.
Results
PIKfyve inhibition by YM201636 resulted in a lysosomal-dependant reduction of alpha-synuclein inclusions as early as 24 h post-treatment. YM201636 induced an increase in nuclear translocation of TFEB, and an increase in lysosomal markers LAMP1 and HEXA. PIKfyve-inhibition was also tested in neuronal-differentiated neuroblastoma-derived cells and iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons. In these cells, YM201636 substantially reduced alpha-synuclein inclusions and increased TFEB nuclear localisation.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that PIKfyve signalling pathways could represent a therapeutic target to reduce alpha-synuclein in PD.

Abstract: Dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase (DDC) is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and serves as an important biomarker reflecting the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Early detection and diagnosis of PD are significantly enhanced by the sensitive and accurate quantification of DDC in serum. This study presents a simple and sensitive electrochemical sandwich sensor for DDC detection in serum, leveraging the unique binding capabilities of lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and the enhanced electrochemical performance of polyethylenimine (PEI)-stabilized MXene. LBP possessing novel structural domains complementary to DDC was utilized to specifically capture the target analyte. The synergistic combination of these materials enabled the construction of an electrochemical sandwich sensor with highly sensitive and specific for DDC detection. The sensor demonstrated a broad linear detection range from 1 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL, calculating a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 88.96 pg/mL. In addition, the binding affinity of LBP and DDC was verified by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), providing a solid foundation for the subsequent clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. This high-sensitivity detection strategy effectively distinguished between PD patients and healthy individuals, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for early detection and clinical analysis of neurological diseases assessment.

Abstract: Objective
The study aimed to explore the effectiveness of codependent cognitive-motor training (CMT) focused on stepping movements in improving balance and cognitive function in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD).
Data Sources
CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid), PEDro, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched up to April 2025 for relevant studies, limited to human studies published in English.
Study Selection
Randomized controlled trials comparing codependent CMT with either conventional physiotherapy (active control) or usual care (passive control) in individuals with PD were included. Eligible outcomes included balance, cognition, motor impairments, functional mobility, and quality of life.
Data Extraction
Four researchers independently reviewed eligible studies for study design, participant characteristics, intervention details, and outcome measures, and also assessed study quality. Three researchers independently extracted the data, which was then double-checked by a fourth researcher.
Data Synthesis
Eighteen randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Codependent CMT significantly improved balance [standardized mean difference (SMD)=0.579; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.340 to 0.817; P<.001], the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (SMD=0.353; 95% CI=0.047 to 0.660; P=.024), part III of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (SMD=–0.306; 95% CI=–0.582 to –0.031; P=.029), and the timed Up and Go test (SMD=–0.395; 95% CI=–0.619 to –0.171; P=.001) compared with active or passive controls in individuals with PD.
Conclusions
Codependent CMT was found to be a beneficial intervention for improving balance, cognitive function, and functional mobility in individuals with PD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD), commonly seen in adults over the age of 65, is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Researchers are working towards developing a highly sensitive biosensor for diagnosing PD. Diamond-gold nanomaterials hybrid on interdigitated parallel microelectrode (IDME) biosensor is introduced for diagnosing PD. Alpha-synuclein contributes to the progression of PD, it was used as a target to diagnose PD, and aptamer was immobilized as a capture molecule. For higher aptamer immobilization, IDME was modified by diamond nanomaterial through 1,1′-Carbonyldiimidazole linker and then aptamer (with or without gold nanoparticle conjugated) was attached on the diamond by using an amine-linker. This aptamer immobilized surfaces detect the alpha-synuclein by aptamer-antibody sandwich and lowers the detection limit to 1 aM [y = 1.5679x − 1.7834; R² = 0.9904] in the buffer sample and 10 aM in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid on a linear regression from 1 aM until 1 nM. In addition, control performances with DJ-1, PARK-1, and complementary anti-alpha-synuclein aptamer failed to increase the current responses confirm the specific detection of alpha-synuclein. This diamond modified IDME quantifies the alpha-synuclein at its lower level and helps to diagnose PD.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson's disease is a progressive, destructive, and long-term disorder of the central nervous system that mainly disrupts the movement system of the body. In the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease, sometimes dementia is also common. In the present study, two patients from two families of five suspected to have Parkinson's disease were investigated to identify pathogenic variants.
Methods and materials
After confirmation by a neurologist and a geneticist, blood samples were taken. Then DNA was extracted from the target sample and analyzed by exome sequencing. The VCF file of WES was extracted using the databases 1000 Genomes, EXAC, NHLBI Sequencing project, GMA variom, HIX (Healthy Exoues), CAD and also with the help of bioinformatics analysis using the HGMD site, all the genes and mutations of this disease were extracted. Then, using the POLY PHEN and SIFT sites, the effect of mutations in causing the disease was investigated separately.
Results
In total, we obtained 3420 variants. After several stages of filtering, 181 variants were reported in 11 genes related to Parkinson's disease, of which 4 variants were new. Two variants related to the PLA2G6 gene and 2 variants related to the NOTCH3 gene, were introduced as pathogenic variants after data analysis using Finch TV software with the help of trench sequencing of NOTCH3 and PLA2G6 gene variants.
Conclusion
It was conducted that the variant reported as heterozygous mutations in NOTCH3 and PLA2G6 genes can be related to the occurrence of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Aging represents a relevant contributing factor to the development of diseases, in-cluding Parkinson's Disease (PD). Recent researchs on the origin of PD underscored the significant role of genomic and proteomic approaches in examining molecular alterations in the brains. Specifically, the shifts in gene expression patterns asso-ciated with processes like neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial impairments have been observed. Nevertheless, the intricate connections between aging and this neurodegenerative condition remain partially understood. Recognizing that pinpointing specific genes and pathways involved in this pro-cess could transform these discoveries into potential treatments, we have devised a network-based strategy to explore how baseline gene expression in brain tissues af-fected by PD evolves with age. For this purpose, data on genes and their expression levels were obtained from the Gene4PD and GTEx databases, allowing us to create distinct gene expression datasets for each brain tissue type across six age groups. In detail, we identified a set of genes exhibiting significant expression changes in certain tissues over time. Additionally, we constructed a related set of protein interaction networks corresponding based on these tissues and age groups. Results revealed six genes with age-dependent expression variations across four brain regions, suggesting their potential involvement in PD progression. Further findings suggest that both age and sex may impact the likelihood of developing PD, emphasizing the need for more studies to unravel the biological mechanisms that contribute to the increased risk of PD associated with aging.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the overpression of α-synuclein (α-syn) and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Ferroptosis, a form of cell death driven by aberrant iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation, has been reported to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of dopaminergic neurons death while the precise mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we identified a cytosolic enzyme glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT)-1 as a negative regulator of ferroptosis through analyses of public databases. Inhibition of GOT1 exaggerated the ferroptosis of dopaminergic neurons death in both in vitro and in vivo PD models. Furthermore, database analysis showed that GOT1 modulate ferroptosis via its intrinsic enzymatic role: depletion of GOT1 substantially blocked the salvage synthesis of methionine and its downstream product glutathione (GSH), which led to oxidative stress and neuronal ferroptosis. Importantly, we found that pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6), a well-used drug in clinical practice, could activate GOT1 thereby enhance the synthesis of methionine and alleviate neuronal ferroptosis. In conclusion, we identified GOT1 as a critical protector of dopaminergic neurons via inhibiting ferroptosis. Activation of GOT1 by pyridoxal phosphate could therefore be a promising therapeutic strategy for patient with PD. Clinical studies are warranted to validate the new translational value of this common-prescribed drug.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis remains challenging due to subjective clinical assessments and late-stage symptom manifestation. Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers, reflecting neurodegenerative changes, offer a non-invasive diagnostic avenue. This study integrates retinal OCT with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to address PD diagnostic uncertainties.
Methods
Leveraging data from the Persian Cohort Study (202 PD patients, 972 controls), we developed a 6-layer deep neural network (DNN) combining OCT biomarkers (foveal thickness and volume) and clinical variables (motor scores, olfactory dysfunction). Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) mitigated class imbalance (PD:Healthy ≈ 1:5). Model interpretability was ensured via SHAP (global feature importance) and LIME (local explanations).
Results
This study developed an explainable AI framework integrating retinal OCT biomarkers and clinical data to diagnose Parkinson’s disease (PD) with 95.3 % accuracy and 0.98 AUC-ROC. Using data from the Persian Cohort (1176 participants), the model identified SUPERIOR4 thickness (<120 µm) and foveal volume expansion (>0.15 mm³) as key biomarkers, alongside motor and olfactory deficits. SHAP/LIME provided interpretable thresholds (e.g., SUPERIOR4 <120 µm = high risk), while SMOTE mitigated class imbalance, reducing false negatives by 12 % without compromising specificity (94.8 %).
Conclusion
This study pioneers a transparent, OCT-based AI framework for PD diagnosis, emphasizing early detection through retinal neurodegeneration patterns. The integration of multimodal data, explainability, and imbalance robustness positions it as a scalable tool for resource-limited settings. Future work should validate biomarkers across diverse populations and standardize OCT protocols.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by motor dysfunction and deterioration of quality of life. PD is caused by a selective degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the mid brain. Although, centuries have passed since the identification of PD, the exact pathogenic mechanism of PD is yet to be defined. It is understood that PD is a multifactorial disease that involves several cellular processes including immunological dysfunction. This review provides a brief introduction to PD and the innate immune system. It then elaborates on the role of the innate immune system in PD, in the context of neuroinflammation and the cellular components including microglia and astrocytes. It then explores the association between neuroinflammation, complement system, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, dopamine metabolism, tyrosine hydroxylase and blood brain barrier in relation to PD. Finally, the review deliberates upon and proposes various diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on the innate immune system that could be utilised to target the immunological mechanisms participating in PD.

A compromised intestinal barrier has been reported in Parkinson’s disease (PD) further reinforcing the assumption that PD is a gut-brain axis disorder and suggesting that gut-derived factors may participate in disease development and/or progression. However, the diversity of methodology between existing studies on gut permeability in PD, especially regarding the methods used for the evaluation of the IEB, has led to diverging results and it is definitely too early to draw any definite conclusions. We envision novel approaches, such as intestinal organoids and confocal laser endomicroscopy that could be used to study more precisely the IEB in PD.

Abstract: Points essentiels
Le diagnostic de la maladie de Parkinson est souvent vécu comme traumatisant par les patients. Il est donc important d’organiser l’annonce diagnostique afin d’accompagner et de soutenir le patient dans cette étape clé de son parcours de soins. La dépression et l’anxiété sont retrouvées chez environ 50 % des patients parkinsoniens. En dehors de la prise en charge pharmacologique, la thérapie cognitivo-comportementale a montré son efficacité pour l’amélioration des symptômes anxio-dépressifs. Il est important d’encourager les patients parkinsoniens à avoir une activité physique régulière d’endurance, dès le début de la maladie, qui permet de lutter contre le déconditionnement à l’effort, d’améliorer les symptômes moteurs, non moteurs, et la qualité de vie, et de diminuer l’isolement social. Les prises en charges rééducatives (kinésithérapie, orthophonie, ergothérapie) peuvent également être proposées aux patients. Contrairement aux idées reçues, il n’existe pas de prise en charge spécifique dans la maladie de Parkinson. L’éducation thérapeutique (ETP) répond au besoin des patients de savoir et de comprendre le pourquoi et le comment de leur maladie, et de leur traitement. L’ETP est organisé différemment en fonction des centres : réalisé en ateliers collectifs et/ou en séances individuelles, par des médecins et/ou des paramédicaux (infirmières, kinésithérapeutes, psychologues, etc.). Les programmes d’ETP sont en constante évolution. Les prochains changements devraient concerner l’éducation des aidants des patients, et l’intégration de patients intervenants dans les équipes éducatives.
Key points
Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is often traumatic. It is then important to organize this announcement in order to support the patient in this major step of his care course. Anxiety and depression are present in about 50% of PD patients. Besides pharmacological treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy induces improvement in anxio-depressive symptoms. We have to promote physical activity for PD patients, from the beginning of the disease, because it prevents from deconditioning, improves motor and non-motor symptoms, quality of life, and decreases loneliness. Rehabilitation may be also proposed (physiotherapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy). But there is no specific recommendation in PD, and usual activities can be proposed. Therapeutic education is an answer for PD patients who need to know and understand their disease and treatment. Organization of therapeutic education is different depending of the teams: group workshop and/or individual sessions, conduct by doctors or paramedical staff (nurse, physiotherapist, psychologist…). Therapeutic education programs are always evolving. It will soon be proposed therapeutic education for care partners, and some patients may join therapeutic education staff.

Abstract: Transplantation therapy using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) cell-derived dopamine (DA) progenitors for Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted attention as an innovative treatment to restore DA neurons in PD, which leads to the improvement of motor disturbance. iPS cells are multipotent stem cells with very high proliferation activity, created by reprogramming mature somatic cells through the transduction of four transcription factors. Relative to fetal midbrain DA neurons, iPS cells have advantages in terms of ethical aspects and availability. On the other hand, the most serious concern associated with therapies with ES/iPS cells is the risk of tumor growth that is caused by the proliferation of undifferentiated ES/iPS cells. Human ES cells that differentiate into DA neurons have been shown to form teratomas. Another concern is graft-induced dyskinesia (GID). GID, which is likely caused by several factors including contamination with serotonergic neurons, developed in the recipients of fetal ventral midbrain (VM) in randomized controlled trials. To enrich the DA progenitor cells and eliminate unwanted cells, a protocol for sorting midbrain DA neurons with antibodies against CORIN, a marker for floor plates, was developed. CORIN-sorted dopamine progenitors were transplanted into the bilateral putamina of MPTP-treated Parkinson models of cynomolgus monkeys, resulting in 18F-DOPA PET-positive graft formation and motor improvement without tumor formation two years after the surgeries. Very recently, a phase I/II trial of iPSC-derived, CORIN-sorted dopaminergic cells for Parkinson's disease was completed (The Kyoto Trial) (Takahashi, 2020; Sawamoto et al., 2025) [1,2]. Based on the results of the trial, we would like to discuss the current status and future perspectives of iPS cell therapy for PD.

Abstract: Introduction
One of the current challenges in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders (MD) is how and when to apply palliative care. Aware of the scarce training and implementation of this type of approach, we propose some consensual recommendations for palliative care (PC) in order to improve the quality of life of patients and their environment.
Material and methods
After a first phase of needs analysis through a survey carried out on Spanish neurologists and a review of the literature, we describe recommendations for action structured in: palliative care models, selection of the target population, when, where and how to implement the PC.
Results
Models of neuropalliative care are reviewed, advocating for the role of the neurologist as a driving force. The members of the multidisciplinary team are described, as well as the main clinical markers and tools that help the clinician to decide which patients have greater palliative needs; sender and receiver are defined and it is detailed in what evolutionary moment and how to proceed when sending the patient to palliative care. A scheme of steps to follow in any PC protocol, whether basic or specialized, is provided, emphasizing the framework in the shared planning of care and the comprehensive approach.
Conclusions
It would be desirable to integrate the PC in the management of PD and other MD and to validate models of neuropalliative care in our environment, analyzing their usefulness through the use of indicators, in order to improve the care and quality of life of our patients.

Abstract: The neuromuscular dysfunction known as Freezing of Gait (FoG), which is more prevalent in individuals suffering from Parkinson’s Disease (PD), significantly reduces the quality of life and increases their risk of falling. Wearable FoG sensing technologies provide timely biofeedback cues to assist people regain control over their gait. However, the devices being bulky, intrusive, and annoyance of current FoG detection algorithms limit their usability in real-world applications. This study proposes a more efficient approach by integrating the FoG detection fusion algorithm into a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) module. The design leverages features with low computational requirements and specialized hardware to minimize the use of physical space and memory. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach with SVM output was deployed to classify FoG and non-FoG periods in real-time. Additionally, the study uses CNN algorithms in fusion with data from a triaxial accelerometer, strain sensors, and piezoelectric plantar sensors to test shank-worn FoG detection devices. The study demonstrates that electrical stimulation-based cueing strategies significantly improve gait control and mitigate FoG episodes in people with Parkinson’s disease. The AiCareGaitRehabilitation system employs a multi-modal sensor fusion strategy to improve the efficacy of the FES device. Data from various sensors—such as strain sensor, 18 plantar sensors, and four quadriceps sensors—the system provides a holistic view of both pre-freezing of Gait (pre-FOG) and post-freezing of Gait (post-FOG) scenarios. This research aims to improve mobility, reduce fall risks, and eventually improve the quality of life for individuals with Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Objective
Cognitive impairments (CI) is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD). With the increasing prevalence of PD, early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions for cognitive decline are crucial. This article reviews major advances in the application of machine learning (ML) to quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) for identifying alterations associated with CI in PD.
Methods
The publications for this review were selected according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) guidelines with the applied search key for publications from January 2016 to March 2024.
Results
Nine studies were included in the review. We summarized the characteristics of the articles, including objective, study group description, analyzed parameters of qEEG, ML models, and analysis results.
Conclusions
These findings indicate that ML using qEEG patterns has proven its effectiveness in detecting and monitoring changes connected with CI in patients with PD. Finding highly specific qEEG patterns would enable the implementation of qEEG analysis into clinical algorithms to enhance the diagnostic process and apply beneficial treatments.
Significance
This review highlights the future potential and methodological challenges of integrating ML with qEEG analysis and neuropsychological diagnostics in advancing the early detection and monitoring of cognitive impairment in PD.

Abstract: Objectives
This study aims to investigate motor symptom fluctuations associated with microlesion effects (MLE) and stimulation in the short term following subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) surgery for Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Materials and Methods
A total of 54 PD patients who underwent bilateral STN-DBS surgery were included in this study. Total motor symptoms were evaluated preoperatively, one week postoperatively, and one month postoperatively. These scores were analyzed to evaluate motor symptom fluctuations due to microlesion and stimulation effects, along with associated factors.
Results
Among the participants, 48 patients (88.89%) exhibited MLE-related improvements in motor symptoms one week after surgery, with an average symptom improvement of 45.92%. At one month post-surgery, 27 patients (50.00%) demonstrated MLE-related improvements in motor symptoms, with an average improvement of 27.08%. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that preoperative tremor subscores were positively correlated with MLE at both one week and one month, while the preoperative Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) score was positively correlated with MLE at one week. Stimulation effects, measured one month postoperatively with the stimulator activated, resulted in an overall motor symptom improvement of 35.21%. No significant differences were observed in stimulation-induced improvements between patients with and without MLE at one week or one month.
Conclusions
This case series demonstrated that the efficacy of stimulation one month postoperatively was not correlated with postoperative MLE in PD patients who underwent STN-DBS surgery. However, patients with more severe preoperative tremor symptoms exhibited greater MLE at both one week and one month postoperatively.

Abstract: Background
Previous studies have demonstrated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) is a well-established rTMS protocol that affects brain neurons, reducing the excitability of the motor system.
Objectives
This study aims to explore the long-term effects of cTBS on improvement of movement symptoms in patients with PD.
Methods
Patients who met the inclusion criteria were non-randomly assigned to either the cTBS group or control group. The cTBS group received rTMS interventions every 10 weeks, while the control group was treated solely with anti-Parkinson's medications for symptom management. The study cycle lasted nearly one year, with data analysis conducted from March to May 2024. Linear mixed models were employed to analyze the primary outcome using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III.
Results
A total of 43 participants completed the 46-week study. The cTBS group demonstrated significant improvement in UPDRS III compared to the control group after the first intervention, maintaining this progress until the final follow-up, which correlated with changes in overall motor symptoms. Additionally, the cTBS group showed a significant decrease in H-Y scale, while the levodopa equivalent dose (LED) did not increase significantly.
Conclusions
These findings implicated that cTBS can effectively alleviate motor symptoms of PD, and rTMS targeting left SMA may be a feasible and easy-to-implement non-drug intervention to slow the progressive decline in motor symptoms and quality of life in PD, providing a new option for PD treatment.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and gait disturbance. The transmembrane protein 230 gene (TMEM230) was initially identified as a disease-causing gene in autosomal dominant PD while the role of TMEM230 in PD remains controversial. This study investigated the genetic role of TMEM230 variants in PD. Whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were performed on a cohort of 518 unrelated PD patients (388 sporadic and 130 familial) and 539 age- and sex-matched controls. Identified TMEM230 variants were analyzed based on frequency assessments, bioinformatics prediction tools, and conservation analysis. The three-dimensional structures of the wild-type and mutated proteins were modeled using SWISS-MODEL and Missense3D, with visualization using PyMOL. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate the association between TMEM230 variants and PD. Eight rare heterozygous TMEM230 variants were identified in sporadic PD patients and controls, including seven missense variants and a synonymous variant. Bioinformatics prediction analyses suggested that p.Gly16Trp and p.Arg23Gln were likely to have a damaging role, supporting their potential involvement in PD pathogenesis. The prevalence of TMEM230 missense variants was significantly higher in PD cases compared to controls (1.93 % vs. 0.37 %, P = 0.017, odds ratio = 5.29, 95 % confidence interval: 1.15–24.24). This study enhances the understanding of the genetic landscape of TMEM230 in the Han Chinese PD population and implies that TMEM230 may function as an autosomal dominant disease-causing gene of PD with low penetrance, or as a susceptibility gene, though the pathogenicity of TMEM230 variants is warranted by further investigation.

Abstract: Increased levels of glutamate, a novel regulator of neuroinflammation, is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) is widely used in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, it has been less commonly used in clinical practice for PD. Here, to explore the clinical significance of variations in glutamate levels in the striatum and thalamus in PD, we included forty-nine PD patients and forty-four healthy controls (HCs). Glutamate levels were analyzed by performing magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) using GluCEST data. Four regions of interest (ROIs) were manually outlined on GluCEST images, and MTRasym values were calculated for each. FreeSurfer was used to calculate the volumes. We found that MTRasym values in the striatum and thalamus were elevated in PD. Variations in MTRasym values were correlated with motor scores. It has been found that the volume of the left pallidal nucleus were reduced in PD. The glutamate levels in the striatum and thalamus were significantly different from those in HCs and associated with disease progression. Collectively, glutamate metabolic abnormalities may be present in PD pathophysiology and associated with disease progression. GluCEST imaging may have potential to become an imaging technology for measuring glutamate alterations in the striatum and thalamus in PD.

Abstract: Summary
Background
Loss of Y chromosome (LOY), an age-related somatic mutation, is associated with various age-related diseases, but its role in the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. This study investigated the relationship between blood LOY levels and the risk of PD onset and progression.
Methods
We estimated the LOY level for each male participant based on genome-wide arrays or whole genome sequencing data. We performed Cox proportional hazards regression analysis among 222,598 male participants in the UK Biobank and linear mixed model analysis involving 2574 male individuals with PD across 14 cohorts, encompassing 19,562 visits. In the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort, we further compared brain structure using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and carried out brain network functional connectivity analysis based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) datasets. Additionally, we assessed the LOY status in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data, which included 1,303,531 cells from 279 post-mortem samples across five brain regions, and performed temporal dynamic gene expression analysis.
Findings
Male participants with LOY had a slightly higher risk of developing PD during follow-up (HR = 1·16, 95% CI = 1·01–1·34, P = 0·04). Among males affected by PD, LOY carriers experienced accelerated neurodegenerative progression, manifesting as more rapid motor impairment (P = 0·0072) and cognitive decline (P = 0·0005) compared to non-LOY carriers. Patients with PD carrying LOY also exhibited decreased network functional connectivity in certain brain regions. Notably, LOY cells were particularly enriched in microglia/immune and vascular/epithelial cells, and a subset of genes in LOY-Mic P2RY12 cells were associated with PD progression.
Interpretation
This data-driven study highlights the potential association of LOY with the onset and progression of PD through the analysis of multi-scale data, including clinical phenotypes, brain neuroimaging maps, and molecular profiles from single-nucleus transcriptome across multi-brain regions. These findings suggest that LOY may be an accomplice to the onset and progression of PD.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a valuable tool for detecting Parkinson’s disease (PD) due to its non-invasive nature and simplicity in data collection. By using deep learning and transformation techniques, researchers can extract numerous features from EEG signals, allowing for a detailed analysis of the disease. However, handling such a huge amount of data is computationally demanding, especially for the fabrication of small, portable handheld PD detection devices, which are a dire need due to the alarming rates at which PD is rising. To overcome this challenge, an enhanced version of the artificial butterfly optimization (ABO) algorithm is introduced to select the most significant features from the feature vectors extracted from the time–frequency transformed EEG signals using a deep convolution network. The algorithm improves upon the original ABO by enhancing its ability to explore and refine feature selection. The main improvement is an adaptive mutation rate, which changes dynamically during the process, starting with a higher rate for more exploration in the beginning and lowering it over time for a more focused optimal solution as the training progresses. This allows for a more efficient selection of crucial features, which are then given to a deep neural network to detect PD. Results show that using this modified ABO (M-ABO) paired with a multilayer perceptron as a fitness evaluator leads to faster, more effective performance compared to the original ABO and particle swarm optimization, achieving accuracy rates of 98.24% and 96.85% on two publicly available datasets.

Abstract: The purpose of this review is to explore the role of the thioredoxin (TRX)/TRX-interacting protein (TXNIP)/microRNAs (miRs) network in neuronal cells and the function of TXNIP-targeted miRs in regulating neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and mitochondria dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). The high TXNIP level activates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1) and trigger a signaling cascade involving the phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). The activation of these kinases contributes to the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein, a hallmark of PD. The brain's TXNIP level in response to oxidative stress is supported by miRs. In PD, miRs such as miR-17, miR-20a, and miR-106b are typically downregulated, resulting in elevated TXNIP levels and the subsequent exacerbation of neuroinflammation. Activation of the Nrf2-ARE (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element) pathway enhances cellular resistance to oxidative stress by upregulating antioxidant genes, including those encoding miRs that inhibit TXNIP. MiR therapy faces several challenges in clinical application, such as the optimization of delivery systems, potential off-target effects, and the achievement of precise treatment. Exploring these bottlenecks and countermeasures can help readers gain a comprehensive understanding of the current research status and future development direction in this field.

Abstract: Despite the growing number of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson's disease, and the associated increasing pressure on global healthcare systems, there is still a lack of reliable laboratory methods that allow for the rapid and highly accurate diagnosis of these diseases at a pre-symptomatic or early stage, i.e., before irreversible pathomorphological and functional changes occur. Furthermore, current treatment strategies remain limited to the management of symptoms and fail to address the underlying causes of Parkinson's disease. This diagnostic and therapeutic gap is becoming increasingly critical. Recent advances in metabolomics, fuelled by major improvements in analytical technologies, now offer unprecedented opportunities to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this context, intermediates of tryptophan metabolism, along with dopamine metabolites such as aminochrome, appear to be particularly promising candidates. They include various neurotoxic, neuroprotective, and otherwise bioactive molecules, which are directly involved in regulating nervous system functions and closely interact with neural structures. Aminochrome, for instance, plays a pivotal role in inducing neurodegenerative processes, including the misfolding of α-synuclein, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Given the accelerating development of metabolomic platforms and the urgent clinical need for early diagnosis and novel therapeutic strategies, the exploration of metabolite-based biomarkers and targets represents a timely and highly relevant research direction.

Abstract: Muscle vibration, a form of proprioceptive stimulation, is a promising therapeutic method for alleviating freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to investigate whether vibration stimulation enhances freezing of gait in Parkinson's Disease by modifying sensory-motor integration and cortical excitability. Sixty patients with Parkinson's Disease patients with freezing of gait were enrolled to participate in 10-m Timed Up and Go test with/without lower limbs vibration stimulation during single, cognitive-load, and motor-load task walking. Spatiotemporal gait data were collected from 36 patients during timed up and go tests with unilateral vibration to the less affected or more affected side and bilateral stimulation. Additionally, 22 and 28 patients with and without freezing of gait, respectively, underwent neuroelectrophysiological evaluations with/without vibration stimulation. Spatiotemporal gait and neuroelectrophysiological relative changes in patients with freezing of gait were compared between “ON” and “OFF” vibration. Our results showed both unilateral and bilateral vibration stimulation improved gait and reduced freezing of gait, with more pronounced effects on the less affected side. Patients with freezing of gait revealed decreased latency afferent inhibition and short interval intracortical inhibition in comparison to patients without freezing of gait and healthy controls. Bilateral vibration stimulation improved latency afferent inhibition and short interval intracortical inhibition, which could be attributed to improvements in gait. Overall, our findings suggested that vibration stimulation improved gait and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease, potentially by enhancing sensory-motor integration and modifying cortical excitability.

Abstract: Eleutherococcus senticosus (Rupr. & Maxim.) Maxim. leaves are commonly used to alleviate neurological disorders. This study aims to screen the effective components that regulate Parkinson's disease model cells. Firstly, the HPLC fingerprints of E. senticosus leaf extracts were established. Meanwhile, a significant modulatory effect of E. senticosus leaf extract on the ROS and GSH levels, cell activity, and antioxidant enzyme activities (GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT) in MPP+-induced astrocytes was confirmed. Then, using ROS and GSH as pharmacodynamic indicators and combining bivariate correlation analysis, gray relationship analysis, and partial least squares regression analysis, caffeic acid, eleutheroside E, and isoquercetin were identified as the effective components for regulating PD model cells. This was validated by measuring the levels of ROS, GSH, MDA and GSH-Px. Finally, the key target of the effective components-STAT3-was identified through network pharmacology. And the interaction between the effective components and STAT3 was revealed by using molecular docking technology. These results can provide a basis for the product development of E. senticosus leaves for the regulation of Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Background
Pramipexole is thought to exert antidepressant effects in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and depression, but its efficacy compared with typical antidepressants is unclear. This meta-analysis aims to directly compare the safety and efficacy of pramipexole and antidepressants for depression in PD patients.
Methods
Twelve electronic databases including Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open Grey, CBM, The CNKI, Wan Fang Data and VIP, and two clinical trial registry websites were systematically searched up to December 30, 2024. The primary outcomes were severity of depression (change in depression rating scale) and tolerability (discontinuation for any reason at the end of treatment). Secondary outcomes included changes in motor symptoms and adverse effects. This study was registered in PROSPERO (reference number: CRD42024525826).
Results
A total of 12 randomized controlled trials involving 772 participants were included. There was no significant difference in the efficacy between pramipexole and antidepressants in the treatment of PD patients with depression (SMD -0.14,95 % CI -0.48 ∼ −0.21, P = 0.45) and they did not differ significantly in terms of tolerability (OR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.36–1.71, P = 0.54, I2 = 26 %). Pramipexole significantly improved motor symptoms better (SMD -0.44, 95 % CI -0.82 ∼ −0.05, P = 0.03) and decreased the incidence of anorexia (P = 0.05), but had a similar risk of other adverse effects as antidepressants.
Conclusion
Pramipexole has an antidepressant effect similar to typical antidepressants while improving motor symptoms in PD patients. Both of them are well tolerated, and may be associated with some common adverse effects, such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting.

Abstract: Phenolic plant metabolites, including hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, homovanillic alcohol, and their acetate derivatives, have emerged as potent antioxidants and promising therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative disorders. These compounds exhibit dual functionality by efficiently scavenging reactive free radicals and targeting key protein residues, thereby alleviating oxidative stress and preventing cellular damage. Using multiscale in silico methodologies, their interactions with peroxyl (ROO•) and hydroperoxyl (HOO•) radicals, as well as with Monoamine Oxidase A (MAO-A), a pivotal enzyme in Parkinson's disease, were systematically investigated. Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses illustrate radical stabilization pathways, supported by MEP, SD, NBO, FMO, and Fukui function descriptors. Hirshfeld surface analysis (HSA) and QTAIM further reveal strong binding hotspots, predominantly stabilized by conventional hydrogen bonding complemented with hydrophobic non-covalent contacts. ADMET profiling underscored favorable pharmacokinetic properties and drug-likeness. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirmed their stable accommodation within the MAO-A catalytic pocket, highlighting significant binding affinities and critical interacting residues. Overall, these findings establish hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and homovanillic alcohol derivatives as potential multifunctional neuroprotective agents against Parkinson's disease.

Abstract: Current Parkinson's disease (PD) management often fails to account for the complex relationship between fluctuating drug levels and symptom variability. Here, fiber-based biochemical and biomechanical sensors have been engineered for continuous monitoring of levodopa levels and motor symptoms. These biochemical sensors exhibit remarkable selectivity and sensitivity towards levodopa, with a linear detection range spanning from 1 µM to 250 µM and a detection limit as low as 0.13 µM. This high-performance detection capability allows for real-time, non-invasive therapeutic drug monitoring, offering insights into disease progression and patient response. Furthermore, triboelectric nanogenerator sensors are integrated to track subtle motor symptoms, such as tremors, complementing the biochemical data. This dual approach provides a comprehensive assessment of PD, enabling personalized treatment strategies by continuously evaluating both drug levels and symptom fluctuations. The combination of these technologies represents a significant advancement in PD management, offering real-time insights that inform pharmacotherapy adjustments and clinical decisions.

Abstract: There is mounting evidence of systemic inflammation in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet inconsistency and a lack of replicability in findings of putative biological markers have delayed progress in this space. Variability in performance between platforms may contribute to the lack of consensus in the biomarker literature, as has been seen for a number of psychiatric disorders, including PTSD. Thus, there is a need for high-performance, scalable, and validated platforms for the discovery and development of biomarkers of inflammation for use in drug development and as clinical diagnostics. To identify the best platform for use in future biomarker discovery efforts, we conducted a comprehensive cross-platform and cross-assay evaluation across five leading platform technologies. This initial assessment focused on four cytokines that have been implicated PTSD – interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interferon (IFN)-γ. To assess platform performance and understand likely measurements in individuals with brain disorders, serum and plasma samples were obtained from individuals with PTSD (n = 13) or Parkinson’s Disease (n = 14) as well as healthy controls (n = 5). We compared platform performance across a number of common analytic parameters, including assay precision, sensitivity, frequency of endogenous analyte detection (FEAD), correlation between platforms, and parallelism in measurement of cytokines using a serial dilution series. The single molecule array (Simoa™) ultra-sensitive platform (Quanterix), MESO V-Plex (Mesoscale Discovery), and Luminex xMAP® (Myriad) were conducted by their respective vendors, while Luminex® and Quantikine® high-sensitivity ELISA assays were evaluated by R&D System’s Biomarker Testing Services. The assay with the highest sensitivity in detecting endogenous analytes across all analytes and clinical populations (i.e. the highest FEAD), was the Simoa™ platform. In contrast, more variable performance was observed for MESO V-plex, R&D Luminex® and Quantikine®, while Myriad’s Luminex xMAP® exhibited low FEAD across all analytes and samples. Simoa™ also demonstrated high precision in detecting endogenous cytokines, as reflected in < 20 percent coefficient of variance (%CV) across replicate runs for samples from the healthy controls, PTSD patients, and PD patients. In contrast, MESO V-Plex, R&D Luminex® and Quantikine® had variable performance in terms of precision across cytokines. Myriad Luminex xMAP® could not be included in precision estimates because the vendor did not run samples in duplicate. For cross-platform performance comparisons, the highest cross-platform correlations were observed for IL-6 such that all platforms – except for Myriad’s Luminex xMAP® – had strong correlations with one another in measurements of IL-6 (r range = 0.59 – 0.86). For the other cytokines, there was low to no correlation across platforms, such that reported measurements of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ varied across assays. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence that the choice of immunoassay could greatly impact reported cytokine findings. The current study provides crucial information on the variability in performance between platforms and across immunoassays that may help inform the selection of assay in future research studies. Further, the results emphasize the need for performing comparative evaluations of immunoassays as new technologies emerge over time, particularly given the lack of reference standards for the quantitative assessments of cytokines.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by the aggregation of α-synuclein and substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons. While numerous neuroprotective molecules targeting Parkinson’s disease have been identified, challenges remain in optimizing the specificity, selectivity, and efficiency of these molecules. Traditional Chinese medicine has emerged as a bountiful source of natural compounds with diverse pharmacological activities, including inhibition of apoptosis or neuroinflammation, modulation of α-synuclein aggregation and clearance of α-synuclein aggregates. This review provides a comparative analysis of representative molecules derived from traditional Chinese medicine that have shown promise in advancing Parkinson’s disease treatment, including tanshinones, paeoniflorin, and ginsenosides. Moreover, the review highlights the role of leading-edge analytical techniques, particularly mass spectrometry and magnetic beads, in identifying and characterizing bioactive compounds, streamlining the process of molecule screening, and offering a more efficient approach for drug discovery. By integrating traditional herbal knowledge with modern scientific techniques, this review seeks to offer researchers constructive information about the development of novel molecules with potential for Parkinson’s disease treatment.

Abstract: Background
T1-weighted structural MRI has advanced our understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet its diagnostic utility in clinical settings remains unclear.
Objective
To assess the diagnostic performance of T1-weighted MRI gray matter (GM) metrics in distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls and to identify limitations affecting clinical applicability.
Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on studies reporting sensitivity, specificity, or AUC for PD classification using T1-weighted MRI. Of 2906 screened records, 26 met inclusion criteria, and 10 provided sufficient data for quantitative synthesis. The risk of bias and heterogeneity were evaluated, and sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding influential studies.
Results
Pooled estimates showed a sensitivity of 0.71 (95 % CI: 0.70–0.72), specificity of 0.889 (95 % CI: 0.86–0.92), and overall accuracy of 0.909 (95 % CI: 0.89–0.93). These metrics improved after excluding outliers, reducing heterogeneity (I2 = 95.7 %–0 %). Frequently reported regions showing structural alterations included the substantia nigra, striatum, thalamus, medial temporal cortex, and middle frontal gyrus. However, region-specific diagnostic metrics could not be consistently synthesized due to methodological variability. Machine learning approaches, particularly support vector machines and neural networks, showed enhanced performance with appropriate validation.
Conclusions
T1-weighted MRI gray matter metrics demonstrate moderate accuracy in differentiating PD from controls but are not yet suitable as standalone diagnostic tools. Greater methodological standardization, external validation, and integration with clinical and biological data are needed to support precision neurology and clinical translation.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that often remains undiagnosed until significant motor symptoms emerge. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention and managing the disease progression. The growing number of biomedical applications has shown the potential of Raman spectroscopy for the detection of novel biomarkers that could enable the rapid and accurate screening of disease susceptibility and onset.
Methods
We design and develop a portable Raman spectrometer for the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease by targeting salivary alpha-synuclein, a key biomarker associated with PD. Raman spectrometer enables non-invasive, rapid, and sensitive detection of alpha-synuclein in saliva samples. The average spectra of saliva were collected for both affected and unaffected individuals. All data were analyzed by integrating spectral data with multivariate data analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), allowing for robust feature extraction and pattern recognition, which are critical for early-stage diagnosis. For the cross validation of these two classifiers, we have obtained a confusion matrix and a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
Results
Preliminary results demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated system in detecting subtle changes in salivary alpha-synuclein levels. The observation of the saliva of the PD patient verifies the presence of all the biochemical components of disordered alpha-synuclein, and the peak width is broader as compared to healthy individual spectra. Here, the β-sheet (1662.34 cm−1) structure gives way to the α-helix (1654 cm−1) structure, causing a red shift in the amide I peak of the impacted PD saliva sample. Multivariate data analysis using computational methods completely differentiated affected disease samples from unaffected samples using their peak patterns. PCA spectral analysis component in which the affected and unaffected PD samples show PC1 = 53.2 %, PC2 = 26.4 %, and PC3 = 8.1 %. For PCA classification, we got 94.4 % specificity and 72.2 % sensitivity with the area under the curve of 82 %. And UMAP classifier has given 83.33 % specificity and 88.9 % sensitivity with an area under the curve of 91 %.
Conclusion
The suggested study opens the door to using the complete salivary Raman spectrum of Parkinson’s disease patients to assess pathology onset and progression. The early findings given here show that Raman analysis of saliva can discriminate PD patients with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The portability and accuracy of this Raman spectrometer, coupled with the computational approach, present a significant advancement in PD diagnostics, with the potential for clinical application. The usefulness of biomarkers in the majority of diseases is based on the ability to identify illness start, evaluate disease progression, and perform continuous monitoring of the efficacy of both treatment and rehabilitative measures.

Abstract: Background and objective
Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) often experience visual hallucinations (VH) and delusions. PD patients with VH reportedly have a higher incidence of dementia than PD patients without VH. The nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) comprises acetylcholine-releasing neurons that are critical for memory, attention, and arousal. Notably, the nbM also exhibits pathological α-synuclein accumulation, which is a hallmark of Lewy body diseases, including PD. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of abnormal α-synuclein accumulation in the nbM.
Methods
nbM sections of PD 28 autopsy patients were prepared and analyzed via immunohistochemistry using antibodies against phosphorylated α-synuclein and Choline acetyltransferase. The analysis included quantitative assessments of Choline acetyltransferase or α-synuclein positive neurons.
Results
Immunohistochemical analyses of the nbM sections revealed significant cholinergic neuron loss in the intermediate nbM of patients with VH compared with those without VH (137 vs. 191, p = 0.04). Moreover, the ratio of α-synuclein-positive cells to choline acetyltransferase-positive cells was significantly higher in patients with VH than in those without VH (p = 0.03).
Conclusions
Pathological changes in nbM—particularly cholinergic deficits in the intermediate part—were therefore identified as potential contributors to VH in PD. These findings add to our understanding of the neuropathological basis of VH in PD and may inform future therapeutic strategies.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and pathological accumulation of p-α-Synuclein (p-α-Syn). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has emerged as a regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, yet its role in PD pathology remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of AMPK activation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in an MPTP-induced PD mouse model. In both undifferentiated and retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), pharmacological AMPK activation with AICAR reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and p-α-Syn aggregation. These effects were associated with enhanced mitophagy, increased lysosomal degradation, and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, collectively restoring mitochondrial integrity and improving dopaminergic features. In vivo, AICAR treatment attenuated nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration in MPTP-exposed mice, reduced p-α-Syn accumulation, and preserved tyrosine hydroxylase expression. Moreover, systemic cytokine analysis revealed that AMPK activation suppressed IL-6–mediated inflammation, while modulating IL-1β levels in a context-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that AMPK activation mitigates α-synuclein pathology, preserves mitochondrial function, and protects dopaminergic neurons in both cellular and animal PD models. Our findings support AMPK as a potential therapeutic target for disease modification in PD.

Abstract: Assistive technology (AT), as defined by the World Health Organization, includes any product, instrument, equipment, or technology adapted or specifically designed for improving functioning of a disabled person and can range from low-tech (e.g., a walking stick) to more complex technologies (e.g., antitremor glove). When evaluating Parkinson's disease (PD) patients for AT, the focus should not be on the device, but rather on the process of service delivery that first identifies a need for AT, and then device selection, ending with outcome evaluation to ensure the patient's need is met. This chapter will outline this process in three major areas related to disabilities in PD (mobility, communication, and manipulation), with supporting scientific evidence of AT implementation and practical implications, when available. Although intended for physicians, this chapter's objective is to raise awareness of these devices and their potential roles in managing PD across the board so that appropriate referral to skilled therapists can be undertaken.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the depletion of dopaminergic neurons, has conventionally been managed through pharmacological intervention and deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. However, drug resistance and the risks of surgical implantation have hindered the effective of current treatment. Herein, we endeavor to engineer a wireless, non-invasive nanoplatform for electrostimulation-enhanced drug therapy, termed BCFO@LCM. This innovative platform integrates magnetoelectric nanomaterials (BaTiO3-CoFe2O4) encapsulated within BV2 cell membranes (CM), enabling traversal of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and dual-targeting of the PD microenvironment through magnetic and membrane fusion mechanisms. When exposed to an external magnetic field, this system facilitates the controlled release of the therapeutic agent L-DOPA for pharmacotherapy, concurrently generating electrical signals via the magnetoelectric nanomaterials to effectuate neuromodulation. Our findings reveal that BCFO@LCM markedly ameliorates dyskinesia in PD model mice, diminishes the attrition of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum, augments tyrosine hydroxylase levels, and ultimately reverses the damage to dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, the non-invasive electrical stimulation enhances neuronal activity within deep brain tissues and fosters the regeneration and differentiation of neurons.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that often affects airway and respiratory function. Although upper airway obstruction following general anesthesia is well documented, we report a rare case of respiratory arrest that occurred prior to anesthesia induction. A 74-year-old woman with Parkinson's disease, receiving levodopa/carbidopa and rotigotine, was scheduled to undergo left mastectomy. Her medications were continued until just before anesthesia. Upon entering the operating room, she appeared to be experiencing the wearing-off phenomenon. Insertion of a peripheral intravenous line exacerbated her rigidity and precipitated respiratory arrest, rendering mask ventilation impossible. Rocuronium and remimazolam enabled effective mask ventilation, although her percutaneous oxygen saturation dropped to 49 %. This case highlights the importance of heightened vigilance in Parkinson's disease patients during the wearing-off phenomenon. Anesthesiologists play a central role in the perioperative management of Parkinson's disease patients and must ensure appropriate medication continuity and preparedness for sudden symptom exacerbation.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a condition without a cure, though its early manifestations can be managed effectively by medical professionals. This underscores the significance of early detection of PD. It has been widely demonstrated that handwriting analysis is a promising avenue for early PD diagnosis. In recent research, there has been a pivot towards leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for analyzing handwriting images to aid in diagnosing the disease. This study introduces an innovative network architecture specifically designed to capture the nuances of tremor and irregular spacing characteristic of PD patients' handwriting. By incorporating an attention mechanism, this network is capable of prioritizing different areas within the handwriting feature map, according to their diagnostic relevance. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy of detecting PD through handwriting analysis, with our model achieving an impressive mean accuracy rate of 96.5 %. When compared to traditional convolutional neural networks, our attention-based continuous convolutional network model demonstrates a substantial increase in diagnostic precision.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative condition. Synaptic dysfunctions are associated with the onset and progressive neurodegeneration exhibited in PD. Healthy, active synapses are a prerequisite for non-pathological neurotransmission. When neurotransmission becomes pathological, such as observed in neurodegenerative conditions like PD, the biomolecules found in and around such synapses need distinctive investigation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) found in neuronal subcellular compartments, such as dendrites, pre-synaptic boutons, and synaptic vesicles, have been garnering attention in neurogenerative diseases. MiRNAs that modulate synaptic activity and synapse function are called synaptic miRNAs. Several miRNAs have been identified that regulate key synaptic proteins; however, information about synaptic miRNAs is largely unknown in PD. In this review, we focused on the most promising synaptic miRNAs, those that are critical for normal synapse function and play a crucial role in PD pathology. We also discussed the synaptic miRNA’s interplay with PD-associated synaptic dysfunction. Investigating further how synaptic miRNAs impacts PD pathogenesis may uncover novel etiological information and potential pathways for treatments and a cure for PD.

Abstract: Free Water (FW) is considered an indicator of neuroinflammation, while the Index of Diffusivity along the Perivascular Space (ALPS) is a recently introduced measure of glymphatic function. However, no study has yet investigated the specific relationships between these factors simultaneously. This study aimed to examine changes in FW in the thalamic midline and lateral nuclei in Parkinson’s disease (PD), with a particular focus on the potential influence of glymphatic system dysfunction. MRI data and clinical information were obtained from 32 healthy controls (HC), 32 participants with prodromal PD (pPD), and 90 participants with PD, sourced from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. The ALPS index and Free Water fractional volume (FWF) were calculated based on diffusion tensor images. Intergroup comparisons of and correlations among MRI measures and clinical assessments were analyzed. FWF was elevated in the bilateral thalamic midline and right lateral nuclei of PD and in right midline nuclei of pPD compared to HC. In the PD group, the right ALPS index was significantly and negatively associated with FWF in the bilateral thalamic lateral nuclei, and mean ALPS index was negatively correlated to FWF in right lateral nuclei. Moreover, FWF in the right lateral thalamic nuclei of PD was correlated with follow-up Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and its 2-years decrease rate. We provided indirect evidence to support that thalamic FW was significantly increased in PD participants, potentially exacerbated by glymphatic system dysfunction.

Abstract: Humans with pathogenic variants of the manganese (Mn) transporter gene SLC39A14 exhibit highly elevated brain Mn concentrations and childhood-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. Here we show that Slc39a14-knockout (KO) mice, a preclinical model of the disease with elevated Mn concentrations in the CB, express deficits in physiological tremor implicating cerebellar (CB) dysfunction. Imaging of intracellular Mn in Purkinje cells (PCs) using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy confirmed highly elevated Mn concentrations in the PCs of Slc39a14-KO mice. To determine biological pathways altered in the CB of Slc39a14-KO mice relative to wildtype (WT), we performed RNA sequencing and discovered significant upregulation of pathways and genes regulating immune response and cell death. To substantiate these findings, we performed quantitative autoradiography of the neuroinflammation biomarker Translocator Protein 18 kDa (TSPO) which was significantly increased in the CB of Slc39a14-KO mice relative to WT. The latter findings were confirmed via immunostaining with the microglial marker Iba-1, revealing widespread microglia activation and clustering in the CB cortex. Immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3 (cCASP3), a marker of apoptosis, showed increased number of PCs with positive immunolabeling for cCASP3 in Slc39a14-KO mice relative to WT. Degeneration of PCs was confirmed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. Lastly, functional electrophysiological assessment of CB neurocircuitry revealed a marked decrease in firing rates of cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons and increased variability of PCs simple spikes firing. Collectively, these findings show, for the first time, Mn-induced PCs degeneration and dysfunctional CB circuitry in Slc39a14-KO mice providing additional evidence for the pathological underpinnings of the dystonia-like movements, balance, and gait abnormalities in SLC39A14 mutation carriers.

Abstract: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is an incurable and progressive neurodegenerative disorder with worldwide prevalence. The application of external cueing devices to mitigate motor symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and improve gait has gained significant attention in recent decades. Many of these studies have yielded significant findings, however, they often overlook gender-related differences that may underlie significant outcomes in longitudinal PD studies and warrant consideration. A review of existing literature shows significant gender differences within this population including differences in disease epidemiology, gait, and dual-tasking abilities. Thus, this paper presents the hypothesis that because males tend to be more severely affected by PD, females are more likely to benefit from external cueing devices such as Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS). Preliminary data using a small cohort supports this hypothesis, warranting further investigation. Validation of this hypothesis will highlight the importance of conducting inclusive research studies and design approaches. Incorporating gender-specific considerations into treatment plans will optimize the efficacy of these therapies and thus lead to a more significant and widespread reduction in disability and improvement in life for individuals managing the symptoms of PD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts patients’ lives. Accurate early diagnosis prediction is crucial for providing timely treatment to delay disease progression. However, current diagnostic methods predominantly rely on the experience and judgment of clinicians, introducing subjectivity and a lack of standardized, quantitative measures. Sparse subspace learning, as a machine learning technique, can extract critical information from multimodal data while addressing issues such as noise, high-dimensional complexity, and class imbalance. Our study utilizes longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging data collected at multiple time points to develop a diagnostic model for PD. The approach involves extracting latent local features and leveraging deep learning techniques to generate a comprehensive global feature subset. Adaptive sparse selection is employed to reduce feature redundancy. Finally, support vector machine is used for classification and regression tasks, specifically for PD diagnosis and disease progression score prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted on the PPMI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 90.78 % for Scan Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD) vs. Normal Control (NC) classification, 83.79 % for PD vs. NC, and 91.50 % for PD vs. SWEDD. The results demonstrate that the proposed method improves PD classification and prediction performance, showing promise for early diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterised by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the mid-brain and accumulation of α-synuclein aggregates referred to as Lewy bodies. PD is a progressive disease and the treatments available are aimed at addressing only its symptomatology. Immune dysregulation is one of the several mechanisms that are hypothesized to contribute towards PD pathogenesis. This review firstly addresses the interaction of innate and adaptive immune components and the role of adaptive immune responses, with a particular focus on T lymphocytes in PD. The review secondly examines the evidence for the involvement of the autoimmune system in PD, including the presence of autoantibodies and the association of autoimmunity with proteins linked with PD (α-synuclein and neuromelanin) and with infections. The review thirdly explores the connection between the gut microbiota the immune system and the impact of this relationship on the pathogenic processes of PD. Finally, this review discusses adaptive immunity based therapeutic strategies for PD, probable PD detection approaches based on autoimmunity, and the potential of gut-microbiome replenishment in PD treatment.

An Amyloidogenic Fragment of the Spike Protein from SARS-CoV‑2 Virus Stimulates the Aggregation and Toxicity of Parkinson’s Disease Protein Alpha-Synuclein,

Abstract: Emerging evidence suggests that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have long-term deleterious effects on the central nervous system and even contribute to post-COVID neurological syndromes. Interestingly, inflammation-induced proteolytic processing of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 leads to the generation of peptides capable of aggregating into amyloid fibrils in vitro. Herein, we investigate the in vitro effect of a fibrillogenic fragment of the Spike protein [Spike 194–203 (S194)] on the aggregation and toxicity of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) protein α-synuclein (αSyn). Our results indicate that S194 fibrils stimulate in a concentration-dependent manner the fibrillation of αSyn monomer, resulting in aggregates with increased capacity of inducing lipid vesicle leakage and toxicity to neuroblastoma cells, in comparison with either αSyn or S194 alone. Bidimensional NMR (1H–15N-HSQC) suggests that S194 fibrils cause a higher perturbation in both the N-terminal region (sequence: 19–68) and the hydrophobic central domain of the αSyn monomer (sequence: 71–95), which is corroborated by protein–peptide docking and molecular dynamics simulations. In contrast with fibrils from wild-type αSyn, aggregates from the PD variant A30P exhibited a remarkable accelerative effect on S194 fibrillation. Similarly, fibrils from amyloid-β peptides, which are linked to Alzheimer’s disease, exhibited a pro-aggregating effect on the S194 monomer. Taken together, these findings might contribute to a broader understanding of the potential connections between SARS-CoV-2 infection and amyloid-related neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting areas that may warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins such as α-synuclein. This review explores the therapeutic potential of tannins, particularly proanthocyanidins and hydrolyzable tannins from grape seeds, in alleviating Parkinson's disease pathology. Condensed tannins exhibit significant antioxidant properties, can cross the blood-brain barrier, reduce oxidative stress, upregulate antioxidant proteins, and prevent neuronal apoptosis. Hydrolyzable tannins, through their unique chemical structure, further help reduce neuroinflammation and improve mitochondrial function. Both types of tannins can modulate inflammatory responses and enhance mitochondrial integrity, addressing key aspects of Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Tannins possess excellent neuroprotective effects, representing a promising therapeutic approach. However, due to their chemical nature and structural characteristics, the bioavailability of tannins in the human body remains low. Current methods to enhance their bioavailability are limited. Further exploration is needed to improve their bioavailability and strengthen their potential clinical applications. Based on this, new Parkinson's disease treatment strategies can be developed, warranting in-depth research and clinical validation.
