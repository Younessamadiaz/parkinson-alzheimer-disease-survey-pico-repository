It leads to irregularities in motor function, speech, and cognitive abilities. Early detection of PD is crucial, as addressing the disease in its initial stages can result in better management and slower progression. This study explores the application of ensemble machine learning (ML) methods to enhance the accuracy and reliability of early PD detection. The ensemble techniques—Bagging, Boosting, Voting, and Stacking—work by combining the strengths of multiple models to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches, thereby improving diagnostic performance. These methods were applied to a feature set of 11 features that includes vocal biomarkers (MDVP, jitter, shimmer, and HNR) etc, which reflect the effects of PD on voice. The combination of ensemble learning as a strong diagnostic tool provides an overall accuracy of 97%, which was achieved in our experiment using 195 vocal samples (147 PD and 48 healthy). The high accuracy levels attained here seem to point toward ensemble methods, potentially providing a clearer advance for PD detection over single deep learning models. In the future, these methods can be validated on larger and more heterogeneous datasets and methods from deep learning will be explored to refine the diagnostic model even further.","","979-8-3503-5750-9","10.1109/ECCE64574.2025.11013416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11013416","Parkinson’s disease;Speech Feature;Machine Learning;Ensemble Methods;Early detection;Vocal biomarkers","Deep learning;Accuracy;Biological system modeling;Stacking;Biomarkers;Boosting;Robustness;Ensemble learning;Spectrogram;Diseases","","","","12","IEEE","29 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores an alternative approach through a biomechanical passive orthosis to suppress tremors. A comprehensive review of existing designs including fluid-based, balloon-based, magnet-based, and spring-based systems, highlights their limitations in terms of mobility, comfort, and usability. To address those issues, a novel spring-based passive attenuator system is proposed through a comprehensive systematic investigation of user needs. The user's criteria and design criteria are mapped together to develop the structural framework of the orthosis that can support full wrist joint movement and has the potential to offer tremor suppression for both flexion-extension and radial-ulnar deviations for PD patients. The proposed device can also emphasize comfort, ease of use and affordability targeting PD patients who experience action and rest tremors. The prototype is produced through 3D printing of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material and preliminary investigation shows that the device allows for a full range of motion, better wearability, and is lightweight, thus improving the daily functionality and quality of life for users.","","979-8-3315-0649-0","10.1109/ICICYTA64807.2024.10912998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10912998","parkinson's disease;tremor suppression;passive orthosis;wrist joint movements","Wrist;Attenuators;Systematics;Reviews;Scalability;Prototypes;Three-dimensional printing;Motion control;Usability;Testing","","","","22","IEEE","11 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Determining the dosage of levodopa requires regular meetings where motor function can be observed. Speech impairment is an early symptom in PD and has been proposed for early detection and monitoring of the disease. However, findings from previous research on the effect of levodopa on speech have not shown a consistent picture. Method: This study has investigated the effect of medication on PD patients for three sustained phonemes; /a/, /o/, and /m/, which were recorded from 24 PD patients during medication off and on stages, and from 22 healthy participants. The differences were statistically investigated, and the features were classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The results show that medication has a significant effect on the change of time and amplitude perturbation (jitter and shimmer) and harmonics of /m/, which was the most sensitive individual phoneme to the levodopa response. /m/ and /o/ performed at a comparable level in discriminating PD-off from control recordings. However, SVM classifications based on the combined use of the three phonemes /a/, /o/, and /m/ showed the best classifications, both for medication effect and for separating PD from control voice. The SVM classification for PD-off versus PD-on achieved an AUC of 0.81. Conclusion: Studies of phonation by computerized voice analysis in PD should employ recordings of multiple phonemes. Our findings are potentially relevant in research to identify early parkinsonian dysarthria, and to tele-monitoring of the levodopa response in patients with established PD.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2021.3066800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380752","Dysarthria;drug response;Parkinson’s disease;sustained phonemes;voice analysis","Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Support vector machines;Monitoring;Jitter;Harmonic analysis;Vibrations","Humans;Levodopa;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Parkinson Disease;Speech;Voice","28","","54","CCBY","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pathologically enhanced beta-band (13–35 Hz) oscillatory activity across the cortico-basal ganglia pathways is a prominent neurophysiological phenomenon associated with PD. We hypothesized that weighing together beta-band frequency peaks from simultaneous microelectrode recordings in “off-state” PD patients could map the individual neuroanatomical variability and serve as a biomarker for the location of the STN sensorimotor neurons. We validated our hypothesis with 9 and 11 patients that, respectively, responded well and poorly to bilateral DBS, after at least two years of follow up. We categorized “good” and “poor” DBS responders based on their clinical assessment alongside a > 40% and <30% change, respectively, in “off” unified PD rating scale motor scores. Good (poor) DBS responders had, in average, 1 mm (3.5 mm) vertical distance between the maximum beta-peak weighted across the parallel microelectrodes and the center of the stimulation area. The distances were statistically different in the two groups ($p = 0.0025$ ).

Thus the speech of subjects who suffer from neurological or psychological disease such as Parkinson's disease or depression differ from the normal speech from healthy speakers. It is characteristic, that their speech tempo is slower, and their articulation is inadequate. These alterations modify the speech product to become monotone and reduce the rate of rapid and significant changes. In this study it was investigated how the ratio of transient parts is affected in case of depression and Parkinson's disease. Overall 321 speech samples were examined from healthy, depressed and Parkinson's diseased speakers. The transient parts were detected in their speech using an automatic transient detection method, and based on the detection, the ratio of the transient parts (RoT) were calculated. It was found that the mean value of RoT in case of depressed and Parkinson's diseased speakers decreased by 9-10% compared to healthy speakers. The RoT was used as the only input of classification experiments, and it achieved quite promising results for separation of healthy and non-healthy speakers with accuracy of 81%.","2380-7350","978-1-5386-7094-1","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2018.8639901","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8639901","depression;Parkinson’s disease;speech biomarkers;diagnostics;SVM;classification","Transient analysis;Parkinson's disease;Speech processing;Energy measurement;Neurological diseases;Distance measurement","","10","","19","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a neurological disorder that progresses over time and the most severe problems after Alzheimer's disease. Our article proposes a Hybrid Feature Selection system for the initial detection of PD from speech recordings. This method picks the best set of instances that can lessen instance vector dimensions from 22 to 5. We have proposed a machine learning-based model using five different classifiers named Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Gradient Tree Boosting. Gradient Tree Boosting presents the best appearance with a spectacular accuracy of 98.31% and the area under the ROC curve 98.66%, among all classifiers used to predict PD. We showed that the stated design has greater accuracy than the current methods available in the literature, and the number of instances is less than others.","","978-1-6654-1447-0","10.1109/ICCCT53315.2021.9711843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9711843","Parkinson's disease;Hybrid Feature Selection;Prediction;Gradient Tree Boosting","Neurological diseases;Parkinson's disease;Predictive models;Boosting;Feature extraction;Hybrid power systems;Random forests","","3","","18","IEEE","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, speech can be exploited as an effective source of diagnostic information for PD. Different types of speech tasks are designed to evaluate subjects' verbal ability. Currently, machine learning methods for the detection of PD mostly concentrate on a single type of speech data. To make full use of the information from multiple sources, multimodal learning has been proposed and developed rapidly in recent years. However, most multimodal frameworks fall short of the reliability requirements of medical diagnosis. To solve this problem, a trustworthy model based on multi-type acoustic materials is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of three major components, i.e., pseudo-type generation, decision-making, and opinion combination. The objective of this endeavor is to offer accurate and reliable PD detection, aiding in the diagnostic process.

Traditional clinical assessment often relies on visual gait analysis, which is a subjective process prone to bias. This study introduces a PD severity classification method that leverages gait features. Methods: A Spatial-temporal Convolutional neural network-Transformer (ST-CNN-Transformer) model for PD severity classification was established. Multimodal gait data, including foot acceleration, angular velocity, and Vertical Ground Reaction Force (VGRF), were collected in collaboration with Xiangyang First People’s Hospital, Hubei Province. Zero-velocity points (ZVPs) were detected using the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), and gait cycle features were extracted from inertial measurement unit data for precise segmentation. The ST-CNN-Transformer model captures spatial-temporal features and periodic correlations. Results: Evaluation on a dataset comprising 10 healthy controls and 30 PD patients yielded a classification accuracy of 98.81%, surpassing existing gait-based methods for PD severity classification. Conclusion: This study introduces a deep learning (DL) approach to automating PD severity classification by integrating ZVP and gait segmentation derived from multimodal data. The proposed model significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. Significance: By combining DL with GLRT-based gait segmentation and multimodal gait analysis, this study proposes a robust and interpretable PD severity assessment framework that contributes to more accurate and objective clinical decision-making.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2025.3611498","Innovation Funds Plan of Henan University of Technology(grant numbers:NO.2021ZKCJ07); Henan University of Technology Young Backbone Teacher Talent Project(grant numbers:NO.21421262); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:NO.2024M760841); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:NO.62201199); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11172342","Convolutional Neural Network;wearable devices;parkinson’s disease;transformer;multimodal data","Feature extraction;Accuracy;Angular velocity;Transformers;Convolutional neural networks;Brain modeling;Windows;Motors;Gait recognition;Electroencephalography","","","","","CCBYNCND","18 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the link between brain structure deficits and physical symptoms in PD, objective brain activity and body motion assessment of patients have been studied in the literature. This study aimed to explore the relationship between brain activity and body motion measures of people with PD to look at the feasibility of diagnosis or assessment of PD using these measures. In this study, we summarised the findings of 24 selected papers from the complete literature review using the Scopus database. Selected studies used both brain activity recording using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and motion assessment using sensors for people with PD in their experiments.

Wearable wireless sensors have been proposed to monitor FoG epochs. Existing automated methods using accelerometers have been introduced with high accuracy performance only for subject-dependent settings (e.g., an individual offline training process). This is a troublesome for large scale out-of-lab deployment and time-consuming. In this work, we used spectral coherence analysis for accelerometer data to apply an anomaly detection approach. Conventional features such as energy and freezing index are introduced to help refine normal epochs while the anomaly scores from spectral coherence measures define FoG epochs. Using this new set of features, our new FoG detector for subject-independent settings achieves the mean ±SD sensitivity (specificity) of 89.2±0.3% (95.6 ± 0.3%).

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that impacts the neurological, physiological, and behavioral systems of the brain. Slow movement, known as bradykinesia, is a prevalent sign of this illness. Symptoms start to show up in midlife and get worse over time. A change in speech patterns is one of the earliest indicators of Parkinson's disease. In this study, it was proposed to diagnose subjective diseases using supervised classification techniques such k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and naïve Bayes (NB). To increase robustness beyond what a single model might provide, we have employed a method known as ensembling. Ensemble learning trains numerous models and then integrates their predictions, as opposed to relying solely on one model. This paper investigates four distinct ensemble algorithms: Adaboost, bagging, majority voting, and weighted voting. A dataset of gathered voice sounds will be used to test the proposed methods. There are 195 biological sounds in the sample, including 147 phonetics for PD patients and 48 for healthy people. The analysis found that an ensemble strategy utilizing decision tree classifiers, MLP, SVM, and the majority voting technique yielded superior results.

At present, fruitful results have been achieved by using intelligent methods to detect individual motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. However, a common challenge in these studies is the limited availability of data due to privacy concerns, making it difficult to obtain diverse symptom data for evaluation purposes. We thus propose the Multimodal Fusion Recognition Model for Parkinson's Disease. This model tackles the problem of cross-modal data fusion and comprises two main components: a multimodal fusion model and a recognition model. First, we extract gait information containing temporal and force-sensing features, as well as handwritten image information that captures spatial strokes. The feature fusion process aligns the different types of data to make them complementary for recognition.

It slowly progresses from mild to severe stage, resulting in the degeneration of dopamine cells of neurons. Due to the deficiency of dopamine cells in the brain, it leads to a motor (tremor, slowness, impaired posture) and non-motor (speech, olfactory) defects in the body. Early detection of Parkinson's disease is a difficult chore as the symptoms of disease appear overtime. However, different diagnostic systems have contributed towards disease detection by considering gait, tremor and speech characteristics. Recent work has shown that speech impairments can be considered as a possible predictor for Parkinson's disease classification and remains an open research area. The speech signals show major differences and variations for Parkinson patients as compared to normal human beings. Therefore, variation in speech should be modeled using acoustic features to identify these variations. In this research, we propose three methodsthe first method employs a transfer learning-based approach using spectrograms of speech recordings, the second method evaluates deep features extracted from speech spectrograms using machine learning classifiers and the third method evaluates simple acoustic feature of recordings using machine learning classifiers. The proposed frameworks are evaluated on a Spanish dataset pc-Gita. The results show that the second framework shows promising results with deep features. The highest 99.7% accuracy on vowel \o\ and read text is observed using a multilayer perceptron. Whereas 99.1% accuracy observed on vowel \i\ deep features using random forest.

In this paper we propose a new walking assist robotic system UPS-PD, which employs pneumatically-actuated artificial muscle and simple control system.

The development of accessible, technology-based methods for longitudinal PD symptoms tracking in daily living, offers the potential for transforming disease assessment and accelerating diagnosis. Methods: A privacy-aware method for classifying patients and healthy controls (HC), on the grounds of speech impairment present in PD, is proposed. Voice features from running speech signals were extracted from passively-captured recordings over voice calls. Language-aware training of multiple- and single-instance learning classifiers was employed to fuse and predict on voice features and demographic data from a multilingual cohort of 498 subjects (392/106 self-reported HC/PD patients). Results: By means of leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, the best-performing models yielded 0.69/0.68/0.63/0.83 area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) for the binary classification of PD patient vs. HC in sub-cohorts of English/Greek/German/Portuguese-speaking subjects, respectively. Out-of sample testing of the best performing models was conducted in an additional dataset, generated by 63 clinically-assessed subjects (24/39 HC/early PD patients). Testing has resulted in 0.84/0.93/0.83 AUC for the English/Greek/German-speaking sub-cohorts, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed approach outperforms other methods proposed for language-aware PD detection considering the ecological validity of the voice data.

Speech/voice disorder is considered one of the symptoms at an early stage. Acoustic and speech signal processing methods can potentially evaluate and measure PD-related vocal impairment. The present work proposed a novel feature selection framework using two levels of the feature selection procedure for voice-loss detection in PD patients. At the first level selection, the principal component analysis (PCA) and the eigenvector centrality feature selection (ECFS) methods are initially calculated independently, and the selected features from each method are considered as a separated sublist, namely ECFS selected features sublist, and PCA selected features sublist, in the first set. Accordingly, the first set, which is the first level selection set, is generated from the union of these two sublists using the top-selected features from both methods. In the training phase, a second level selection, which forms the second set (which is a subset from the first set), is generated to calculate the proposed weight of each selection method. Since in the present work, the ECFS provided superior performance to the PCA in the first level selection, the ECFS is applied to the first set in order to find weight values based on the contribution/impact of the top-selected PCA- and ECFS- features in the second level. This weight is determined by finding a proposed ratio, which is multiplied directly by the selected ECFS features in the first level. The selected weighted ECFS features are then combined with the same PCA features to avoid ignoring any of the top-ranked features from the first level. This combination includes the final weighted-hybrid selected features that fed to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to evaluate the proposed weighted hybrid selected features. Hence, in the test phase, the generated weight is used directly without any further need for the second level selection. Several comparative studies were conducted to evaluate the proposed feature selection performance for PD voice-loss detection. The experimental results established the superiority of the proposed procedure using cubic kernel-SVM with 94% accuracy for voice-loss detection in PD, while, with the same classifier, 88% accuracy was achieved without using the proposed selection method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2989032","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:D-566-135-1441); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9072452","Parkinson’s disease;voice loss;feature extraction;feature selection;principal component analysis;eigenvector centrality feature selection","Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Speech processing;Parkinson's disease;Support vector machines;Acoustic measurements;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","","29","","44","CCBY","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gait analysis has been proven to assist in defining PD progression and Machine Learning algorithms aid in predicting the PD severity by learning intricate details from multidimensional gait datasets. Classifiers that best predict the severity level with better explainability of results are thus a requisite. This paper proposes an Information Set-based Decision Tree (IFS-DT), a classification algorithm that adopts a probabilistic-possibilistic approach for predicting the target variable. Information carried by each feature of the dataset is utilized rather than the possibility of its occurrence which reduces uncertainty in determining the outcome. PD gait dataset built from VGRF signals obtained from the PhysioNet database is utilized for analyzing the proposed work. The IFS-DT classifier performs better than conventional DTs and provides results comparable to that obtained by an ensemble of classifiers. Statistical analyses such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test are conducted to validate the significance of the findings. Moreover, the importance of training a model with a balanced dataset with optimal sample size for obtaining reliable prediction results is also discussed.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3456438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10669567","Class imbalance;decision tree;explainable AI;gait analysis;machine learning;Parkinson’s disease","Support vector machines;Diseases;Classification tree analysis;Accuracy;Nearest neighbor methods;Hidden Markov models;Entropy;Explainable AI;Machine learning;Parkinson's disease","","2","","41","CCBYNCND","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work aims to develop a new Hybrid CNN-RF model that combines neuroimaging and clinical predictors in order to enhance the identification and categorization of PD. Specific biomarkers like cortical thickness and basal ganglia intensities which could be difficult for a CNN to pick up separately are extracted while patient demographics, UPDRS scores etc. are used by the RF for final classification. The proposed model was tested using a diverse dataset and produced high performance with an accuracy of 92.5 % and sensitivity and specificity of 91.2% and 93.8% respectively and an area under the curve of 0.95 only. The results of comparative analysis showed that application of the Hybrid CNN-RF model provides a higher accuracy (95.3%) compared to standalone CNN and RF models that demonstrated accuracies of 88.7% and 85.3% correspondingly. An ablation study also supported the above findings where if the neuroimaging features were removed, the accuracy was 84.7%; similarly, if clinical features were removed the accuracy was 85.3%. The results show the versatility of the model to incorporate additional information from neuroimaging and clinical data efficiently. Moreover, in the group of 20 epochs, the training accuracy and validations were also close and depicted a stable learning behavior of the model. In addition to providing evidence for the effectiveness of the Hybrid CNN-RF model in PD diagnosis, this research highlights the prospects of the multimodal paradigm for improving the diagnostic process.

Accurate assessment of gait features is critical to personalized rehabilitation for patients with PD, yet difficult to be routinely carried out as clinical diagnosis using rating scales relies heavily on clinical experience. Moreover, the popular rating scales cannot ensure fine quantification of gait impairments for patients with mild symptoms. Developing quantitative assessment methods that can be used in natural and home-based environments is highly demanded. In this study, we address the challenges by developing an automated video-based Parkinsonian gait assessment method using a novel skeleton-silhouette fusion convolution network. In addition, seven network-derived supplementary features, including critical aspects of gait impairment (gait velocity, arm swing, etc.), are extracted to provide continuous measures enhancing low-resolution clinical rating scales. Evaluation experiments were conducted on a dataset collected with 54 patients with early PD and 26 healthy controls. The results show that the proposed method accurately predicted the patients’ unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale (UPDRS) gait scores (71.25% match on clinical assessment) and discriminated between PD patients and healthy subjects with a sensitivity of 92.6%. Moreover, three proposed supplementary features (i.e., arm swing amplitude, gait velocity, and neck forward bending angle) turned out to be effective gait dysfunction indicators with Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.78, 0.73, and 0.43 matching the rating scores, respectively. Since the proposed system requires only two smartphones, it holds a significant benefit for home-based quantitative assessment of PD, especially for detecting early-stage PD.

PD patients mainly suffer from motor symptoms, which significantly impact their daily lives. The diagnostic criteria for PD include the presence of muscle rigidity, tremor, and postural reflex disturbances. The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is the standard tool for evaluating PD symptoms, part III of which is dedicated to motor symptoms. That part involves a comprehensive set of specific physical examinations, and physicians assign semi quantitative scores from 0 to 4. However, this approach faces notable challenges, including the requirement for movement-disorder experts proficient in using MDS-UPDRS and the presence of substantial inter rater variability even among experts. Overcoming these challenges requires a quantitative and objective assessment method. Given that the rating of motor symptoms predominantly involves assessing kinematic characteristics, the integration of sensor-based devices and machine learning techniques holds the potential to outperform human experts in symptom evaluations. This study used the Leap Motion optical motion-capture device to quantitatively measure and analyze hand movements while 45 PD patients performed the following 3 tasks from the MDS-UPDRS part III: finger tapping (FT), hand opening and closing (OC), and forearm pronation and supination (PS). Data from these tasks were collected and processed, resulting in the extraction of 31 movement patterns for each task. Additionally, 69 statistical features were extracted from each movement pattern, yielding 2139 features for each task. We subsequently employed a random forest algorithm to select the top 15% of features based on the reduction of Gini impurity. These selected features were subsequently fed into a sequential-forward-floating-selection algorithm, combined with a support vector machine, to identify relevant feature combinations and predict the severity of the motor symptoms. The classification accuracy was 87.0% for FT, 93.2% for OC, and 92.2% for PS. One-way analysis of variance identified 13 features of the OC task that were significantly more discriminative for classifying the movement disability of PD patients ( ${p}$ <0.05).

Early detection is critical for effective intervention, yet traditional diagnostic methods often face limitations in accuracy and timeliness. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model combining EfficientNet, BiLSTM, and GANs to improve PD detection accuracy using medical images and sequential data. EfficientNet is employed for extracting features from MRI scans, while BiLSTM is used to analyze temporal data, such as gait and speech patterns, to capture the progressive changes associated with PD. Additionally, GANs are utilized to augment the dataset, addressing the challenges of data scarcity and imbalance. The fusion of spatial and temporal features enables a more comprehensive understanding of PD, improving diagnostic performance. Bayesian optimization is applied for hyperparameter tuning, and K-fold cross-validation ensures robust model evaluation. The results demonstrate that the hybrid model outperforms single-modal approaches in both classification and regression tasks, offering enhanced accuracy in detecting PD and predicting disease severity. Furthermore, interpretability techniques like Grad-CAM and attention mechanisms are incorporated to provide insights into the model's decision-making process. This work presents a promising approach for automating PD diagnosis and lays the groundwork for further research in multi-modal deep learning for disease detection.","","979-8-3315-2392-3","10.1109/ICSADL65848.2025.10933259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10933259","Deep Learning;Medical Imaging;EfficientNet;BiLSTM;Bayesian Optimization;Data Augmentation;Neurodegenerative Disorders","Deep learning;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Bidirectional long short term memory;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Data augmentation;Data models;Optimization;Medical diagnostic imaging","","","","20","IEEE","27 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dataset utilized consists of various handwriting metrics such as root mean square, mean relative tremor, and differences in radii between exam templates and handwritten traces. By training the DNN-MLP on these features, an accuracy of 83% was achieved, surpassing other traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (81%), Random Forest (75%), and k-Nearest Neighbours (77%).

The purpose of the proposed effort was to identify Parkinson’s disease in early prediction using clinical imaging and machine learning technologies. Despite the fact that there are numerous methods for detecting Parkinson’s disease, using MRI scan images still it is a big challenge. In this study, an Adaboost classifier is used with a hybrid PSO algorithm to propose a novel technique for detecting Parkinson’s disease. Adaboost acted as the best classifier among other classifiers. Initially, MRI image best features are extracted and identified by the curvelet transform and principal component analysis. This Ad boost classifier receives optimal features as input. Finally, Adaboost classifieds the MRI images and gave excellent classification accuracy. To evaluate the proposed method three methods metrics namely accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity are used.

Traditional diagnostic methods could be prone to subjectivity issues because they depend on the evaluation of subtle motions that might be difficult to define with the human eye. Hence, simple and reliable engineering methods are required for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and for providing timely treatment to the tens of millions of patients who are affected by this disease. In this work, we developed a flexible sensor using laser-induced graphene to differentiate between natural finger bending and hand tremor. Measurements were recorded when the sensor was bent at various angles (30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 120 degrees, and 150 degrees) to mimic the natural finger-bending movements. Moreover, hand tremor was simulated by shaking the sensor vigorously. Our findings demonstrated a nearly linear relationship between the peak voltage measured across the laser-induced graphene sensor and the amount of bending. The degree of natural bending and hand tremors were multi-classified using a neural network machine learning classifier, showing an accuracy of 78.5% and an area under the curve of 0.97. The results of this study are promising in making an informed decision about differentiating Parkinson's-induced hand tremors from natural body movements and reducing misdiagnosis of Parkinson's.","","979-8-3503-9918-9","10.1109/DCAS57389.2023.10130272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130272","Parkinson's disease;Laser-induced graphene;Machine learning;Multiclassification;Area under the curve;Wide neural network","Voltage measurement;Parkinson's disease;Circuits and systems;Graphene;Neural networks;Machine learning;Bending","","1","","20","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automated bradykinesia assessment is critically needed for helping neurologists achieve objective clinical diagnosis and hence provide timely and appropriate medical services. This need has become especially urgent after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019. Currently, the main factor limiting the accurate assessment is the difficulty of mining the fine-grained discriminative motion features. Therefore, we propose a novel contrastive graph convolutional network for automated and objective toe-tapping assessment, which is one of the most important tests of lower-extremity bradykinesia. Specifically, based on joint sequences extracted from videos, a supervised contrastive learning strategy was followed to cluster together the features of each class, thereby enhancing the specificity of the learnt class-specific features. Subsequently, a multi-stream joint sparse learning mechanism was designed to eliminate potentially similar redundant features of joint position and motion, hence strengthening the discriminability of features extracted from different streams. Finally, a spatial-temporal interaction graph convolutional module was developed to explicitly model remote dependencies across time and space, and hence boost the mining of fine-grained motion features. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that this method achieved remarkable classification performance on a clinical video dataset, with an accuracy of 70.04% and an acceptable accuracy of 98.70%. These results obviously outperformed other existing sensor- and video-based methods. The proposed video-based scheme provides a reliable and objective tool for automated quantitative toe-tapping assessment, and is expected to be a viable method for remote medical assessment and diagnosis.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3195854","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171273); Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai(grant numbers:22ZR1432100); Med-Engineering Crossing Foundation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University(grant numbers:AH0820009,YG2022QN007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847262","Parkinson’s disease;toe tapping;video-based assessment;contrastive learning;graph convolutional network","Feature extraction;Videos;Task analysis;Deep learning;Parkinson’s disease;Convolutional neural networks;Support vector machines","","10","","50","IEEE","1 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, traditional gait-phase-specific EEG analysis only measures the brain activities in the isolated gait phase, but neglects the between-gait-phase interactions as well as the whole-gait-cycle characteristics, and therefore is unable to effectively reflect the abnormal cortical gait control. Methods: In this study, we introduced three whole-gait-cycle measures of intra-stride EEG activity (i.e., mean desynchronization, amplitude of fluctuations, and coupling to the gait phase), and investigated their abnormalities in PD and relationships with gait impairments, which were further compared with the traditional gait-phase-specific measures. Results: Compared with healthy controls, PD patients showed overwhelming stronger desynchronizations (ERD) across the whole gait cycle in θ, α and low-β bands, implying a cortical compensatory strategy in response to the low efficiency of the motor network. Patients also exhibited weaker intra-stride ERD fluctuations in the central area in α and low-β bands, with reduced amplitude and less coupling to the gait phase, which were correlated with gait impairments in walking speed, gait rhythm and walking stability. However, gait-phase-specific EEG measures did not show any significant correlation with gait impairments in PD. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the efficiency of whole-gait-cycle EEG measures in characterizing the abnormal cortical gait control, and for the first time, associated gait impairments with weak intra-stride electrocortical fluctuations.

These days, machine learning algorithms are used in the healthcare industry to identify patients' health problems. This research went into great detail about the methods used using algorithms that use machine learning to classify Parkinson's disease. A fault in the brain cells that generate dopamine, a necessary chemical for synapses to connect with one another, is the cause of Parkinson's disease. The brain's dopamine-producing neurons are in charge of control, flexibility, and event familiarity. When 60–80% of these cells disappear, inadequate dopamine is produced, which causes Parkinson's disease symptoms to manifest. In this case, the Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Support Vector Machine techniques were used to identify the illness.

We performed analysis through functional enrichment and proteinprotein interaction (PPI). The GDC information gateway was utilized in this research to evaluate connected genes with clinical information to identify the most important PD genes. We found differential expression genes to separate the genes with varying levels of expression between the mutant and normal groups (DEGs). Additionally, we evaluated their importance in PD using the GDC Data site. Jeratinine E, an alkaloid, might be considered as a treatment option. Molecular docking study was carried out to have a better knowledge of the chemical reactions between the compounds that are bioactive and the NNMT protein. The molecular docking research indicates that Jeratinine E has a greater selectivity for NNMT. The ADMET analysis also highlighted the ability for additional study of jeratinine E.","","979-8-3503-4800-2","10.1109/ICSTSN57873.2023.10151586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10151586","Parkinson’s;Datasets;Differential expression genes;Biomarkers;NNMT protein;Jeratinine E","Enzymes;Artificial neural networks;Logic gates;Compounds;Medical diagnosis;Gene expression;Clinical diagnosis","","","","15","IEEE","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, researchers have looked into the boundary of speech analysis as a non-invasive approach to differentiate between individuals afflicted by Parkinson’s disease and those who do not have the condition. The main goal of this work is to Detect Parkinson’s Disease using the Wavelet feature (DetParWav) by combining different classification techniques with the feature selection methods known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Mutual Information Gain (MIG). For the experiment, we have used a PD dataset from the UCI (University of California Irvine) repository of 188 PD and 64 HC’s (Healthy Control) voice signals. We have found an accuracy of 91.60% was achieved from the classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel and 88% accuracy was achieved from the classifier Decision Tree, which shows that these approaches provide reliable computational tools for accurately detecting the presence of PD in the initial phase.","","979-8-3503-0525-8","10.1109/GCAT59970.2023.10353305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10353305","Parkinson’s Disease;PCA;Mutual Information Gain;Machine Learning;Classifiers","Support vector machines;Speech analysis;Neurons;Medical treatment;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Reliability","","","","14","IEEE","19 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The innovative device integrates several advanced features, including a temperature sensor and an in-built Parkinson's tap test. The stabilizing mechanism utilizes a combination of gyroscope and accelerometer sensors to detect and counteract hand tremors, ensuring that the spoon's bowl remains stable regardless of the user's involuntary movements. This functionality significantly enables users to consume without support, thereby improving their quality of life. The temperature sensor embedded in the spoon provides real-time feedback and prevents consuming edibles in a very hot state, causing burns, which is crucial for users with reduced sensory perception. Furthermore, the Parkinson's Tap test, a diagnostic tool traditionally used to assess the severity of tremors and motor control, is incorporated into the device. This diagnostic feature allows for regular, automated assessments, capturing detailed patient motor function data over time. All the data are transmitted to healthcare providers via a connected mobile application, facilitating remote monitoring and timely medical intervention. The device features two interchangeable spoon heads for liquids and solids, thus providing versatility for different types of food. The device is designed to be cost-effective by using NodeMCU ESP-32S microcontroller and MPU6050 sensors. This approach makes the device affordable to a wider section of users.

The combined analysis of electroencephalography and electromyography allows studying the motor cortex activity through the movement-related potentials, determining a novel set of indexes that could be used for the PD diagnosis and classification. In a future perspective of an application-specific integrated circuit implementation, the real-time data processing has been fully realized on the Altera Cyclone V field-programmable gate array (FPGA), without interactions with embedded processor architecture.

Identification of an appropriate feature of the EEG used to have a key role for its analysis. This work specifically describes feature extraction of EEG signals of persons with Parkinson’s Disease(PD) by using statistical methods. Mean, standard deviation, energy, kurtosis and skewness are the five statistical features selected for this work. In addition to the extraction of features, comparative analysis of these features are also provided considering the EEGs of both normal (Non PD) and the persons with PD symptoms by using T-test. With the use of T-test, without the application of any classification techniques, the features of any two classes can be well differentiated. In the proposed approach, the results show that the p-assessment of the T-experiment is less than 0.05 and hence it can be considered that the features of the two classes are having less than 5% similarity. This fulfils the objective of detecting PD most efficiently. Out of the five features considered, Mean and Energy are the features, which are capable of differentiating the two categories of the subjects most significantly.","","978-1-7281-6644-5","10.1109/ComPE49325.2020.9200194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200194","Neurological disorder;EEG;Parkinsons disease;statistical features","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Standards;Neurons;Diseases;Tools;Transforms","","10","","24","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, a database consisting of 100 participants (50 PD and 50 healthy controls (HC)) was created with a balanced distribution in terms of age range, average age and gender. Participants were asked to follow a stimulus that appeared randomly on screen of VNG system for approximately 42 seconds. To eliminate this randomness in the time series patterns, a new data set was created by taking the difference between the reference signal of the stimulus signal and the participants’ eye movement signals during the tests. Shannon wavelet entropy was employed to calculate the signal entropy. Leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation scheme is used with k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifiers. The kNN classifier with k=3 and Chebyshev distance achieved the acceptable patient-healthy classification performance with 84.0% accuracy, 82.7% sensitivity, 84.30% F-score and 0.68 Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient scores.

However, significant inter-person differences in handwriting make it difficult to identify pathological handwriting, especially in the early stages. This paper reports the testing of NeuroDiag, a software-based medical device, for the automated detection of PD using handwriting patterns. NeuroDiag is designed to direct the user to perform six drawing and writing tasks, and the recordings are then uploaded onto a server for analysis. Kinematic information and pen pressure of handwriting are extracted and used as baseline parameters. NeuroDiag was trained based on 26 PD patients in the early stage of the disease and 26 matching controls. Methods: Twenty-three people with PD (PPD) in their early stage of the disease, 25 age-matched healthy controls (AMC), and 7 young healthy controls were recruited for this study. Under the supervision of a consultant neurologist or their nurse, the participants used NeuroDiag. The reports were generated in real-time and tabulated by an independent observer. Results: The participants were able to use NeuroDiag without assistance. The handwriting data was successfully uploaded to the server where the report was automatically generated in real-time. There were significant differences in the writing speed between PPD and AMC (P<0.001). NeuroDiag showed 86.96% sensitivity and 76.92% specificity in differentiating PPD from those without PD. Conclusion: In this work, we tested the reliability of NeuroDiag in differentiating between PPD and AMC for real-time applications. The results show that NeuroDiag has the potential to be used to assist neurologists and for telehealth applications.

Early identification of balance disorders in PD and performing timely rehabilitation can resist the progressive tendency of the activity limitations. However, clinical assessment tests of balance appear to rely on therapists, who may fail to capture changes of dysfunction in the early stage of PD, since some deficits only appear in specific situations. There is a need for an efficient approach to induce the symptoms of the patients and be capable of detecting mild balance dysfunction in early PD assessment. In this pilot study, an imbalance events detection approach based on virtual reality-induced symptoms and effects (VRISE) is proposed for Parkinson's disease balance assessment. A virtual environment was designed to provide misleading visual feedback to the subjects in order to induce the imbalance events. Electromyography (EMG) and plantar pressure signals were recorded and utilized to quantitatively evaluate the balance ability of subjects.

One of the more pressing concerns is the detection of early stages of PD, namely, stages 1 and 2 for assigning a proper therapy helping to notably reduce the disease progression. In these stages, symptoms might not be as distinguishable and might be more easily confused with other diseases. We report on an approach based on wearable sensors and machine learning to differentiate healthy controls from patients with stages 1 and 2 PD. For this reason, we designed 11 common exercises and collect the data via a wearable commercial off-the-shelf accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors.

Integrating time-domain and frequency-domain analysis methods is essential to better understand and assess cognitive ability. Timely identification of cognitive levels in early Parkinson’s disease (ePD) patients can help mitigate the risk of future dementia. For the investigation of the brain activity and states related to cognitive levels, this study recruited forty ePD patients for EEG microstate analysis, including 13 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 27 without MCI (control group). To determine the specific frequency band on which the microstate analysis relies, a deep learning framework was employed to discern the frequency dependence of the cognitive level in ePD patients. The input to the convolutional neural network consisted of the power spectral density of multi-channel multi-point EEG signals. The visualization technique of gradient-weighted class activation mapping was utilized to extract the optimal frequency band for identifying MCI samples. Within this frequency band, microstate analysis was conducted and correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Scale. The deep neural network revealed significant differences in the 1-11.5Hz spectrum of the ePD-MCI group compared to the control group. In this characteristic frequency band, ePD-MCI patients exhibited a pattern of global microstate disorder. The coverage rate and occurrence frequency of microstate A and D increased significantly and were both negatively correlated with the MoCA scale. Meanwhile, the coverage, frequency and duration of microstate C decreased significantly and were positively correlated with the MoCA scale.

However, most earlier studies have treated the hippocampus as a singular global structure, focusing mainly on its overall volume or surface area alterations. There is a notable gap in detailed research on local morphological changes in the hippocampus during the early stages of PD. Our study involved T1-weighted MRI scans of forty-eight early-stage PD patients and forty-eight age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Initially, we assessed the global volume and surface area of the bilateral hippocam-pus. Subsequently, we delved into the detailed morphometric changes at the subfield scale of the bilateral hippocampus using a novel surface-based morphometric approach. Our findings indicate no significant global differences, except in the surface area ratio between the left and right hippocampus. However, significant deformations, primarily atrophic regions, were observed at the subfield level, particularly in the CA1 subfield, followed by the CA2-CA3 and Subiculum subfields. In summary, our study reveals that the CA1 sub-field is most vulnerable in early-stage PD, with atrophy likely progressing from CA1 to other subfields. This study also underscores that global metrics, such as volume or surface area, lack the sensitivity to accurately detect hippocampal deformations in early-stage PD.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-3748-8","10.1109/BIBM58861.2023.10385739","Zhejiang Xinmiao Talents Program; Innovation Fund; Lanzhou University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10385739","Parkinson’s disease;magnetic resonance imaging;hippocampus;morphometry","Sensitivity;Deformation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Surface morphology;Focusing;Hippocampus;Surface treatment","","","","36","IEEE","18 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework is applied to investigate the mechanism and improvement measure of gait disturbance for Parkinson's disease (PD). $H\beta$ modulation is suppressed at the time of contralateral heel strikes and rebounds when the contralateral foot rests on the ground and the ipsilateral foot is raised. Prominent PACs exist between $\delta$ and $L\beta/H\beta$ activities. Auditory cue improves the gait; meanwhile, it enhances the $H\beta$ modulation, and suppresses the $\delta-L\beta/H\beta$ PACs, which may rebound toward the before-cue stage afterward. Our findings suggest the proposed UPEMD-PAC is a useful framework in quantifying PAC with pre-determined frequencies, whereas the $\delta-L\beta/H\beta$ PACs in the subthalamic nucleus serve as potential biomarkers for gait disturbance in PD. Clinical Relevance- This manifests the efficacy of auditory cues on gait disturbance. The proposed framework may be useful in diagnosing the severity of motor impairment.","2694-0604","978-1-7281-2782-8","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871963","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171028,62001026); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9871963","","Couplings;Frequency modulation;Empirical mode decomposition;Parkinson's disease;Biomarkers;Picture archiving and communication systems;Time measurement","Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Humans;Parkinson Disease;Physical Therapy Modalities;Subthalamic Nucleus","","","23","IEEE","8 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Losing control over the gait cycle is a common phenomenon which leads to a deviation in the gait cycle of the patient. The variation of the gait cycle can be explained in two approaches: temporal variation and spatial variation. In this paper, an analysis which exclusively focuses on the spatial variation is done to determine the gait cycle deviation of Parkinson patients from a healthy person. This work analyzes the step lengths and stride lengths of the patients without the help of any external influence and compares the results against the healthy subjects. From the study, it ends up clear that on account of a Parkinson disease, step lengths, and stride lengths both are shorter than healthy individuals and a quantitative connection between these parameters are determined here.","","978-1-5386-9279-0","10.1109/WiSPNET45539.2019.9032870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9032870","Parkinson’s Disease;Gait Analysis;Stride Length;Step Length;Median Filter","Parkinson's disease;Foot;Legged locomotion;Standards;Kinetic theory;Spatial databases","","3","","19","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It affects the gait, speech, and memory. The diagnosis and treatment requires physical visits which are extremely difficult and cumbersome for the older people. Making use of speech signals for the Parkinson's disease diagnosis provides a non-invasive, less time-consuming and painless experience to the patients. This paper's main objective is to build a feature vector that comprises of a time domain feature, Zero Crossing Rate, a frequency domain feature, the Spectral Centroid and the cepstral features from the 14 coefficients of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), MFCC Delta and MFCC Delta-Delta. Support Vector Machine (Linear and Polynomial kernels), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are utilised to classify Parkinson's disease. Support Vector Machine (both Linear and Polynomial kernels) achieved the maximum accuracy of 92.31 % as in contrast to the other machine learning algorithms considered in this paper. It is found from the comparison with the existing models that the proposed model with SVM classifier performed better than the other models.","","979-8-3315-4068-5","10.1109/IConSCEPT61884.2024.10627874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10627874","Parkinson's Disease;speech sentences;preprocessing;MFCC;SVM Linear and Polynomial kernels","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Accuracy;Parkinson's disease;Biological system modeling;Polynomials;Vectors","","1","","23","IEEE","22 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eight patients suffering from the Parkinson's diseases are invited to wear the wearable devices before and after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy to obtain the resting tremor signals. Then, the resting tremor signals are classified into two groups, namely before and after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy. To perform the classification, first the signals are represented in the frequency domain via performing the fast Fourier transforms. Then, the ratios of the energies of the signals in the frequency band 3-8Hz to the whole frequency band are computed. The computer numerical simulation results indicate that the signals obtained from seven out of eight patients can be correctly classified whether they correspond to before or after applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy. Through our proposed method, it can be concluded that applying the bio-electronic stimulation therapy to the patients suffering from the Parkinson's diseases is effective.","","978-1-7281-6743-5","10.1109/CSNDSP49049.2020.9249509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9249509","Parkinson's disease;fast Fourier transform;tremor;frequency spectrum.","Performance evaluation;Parkinson's disease;Fast Fourier transforms;Frequency-domain analysis;Wearable computers;Medical treatment;Numerical simulation","","","","11","IEEE","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
