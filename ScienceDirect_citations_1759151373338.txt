Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, the treatment of PD is mainly based on surgery and medication, and there is a pressing necessity to develop a new generation of strategies incorporating biomaterials for treating PD. Herein, an antioxidative injectable chitosan hydrogel crosslinked with tannic acid-modified dialdehyde polyurethane nanoparticles (TA@DAP) to target RIPK1 is produced for ameliorating PD. The TA@DAP nano-crosslinker is newly synthesized via hydrogen bonding together with electrostatic interactions and is characterized by small angle X—ray with its data modeling, showing enhancement in dispersion stability, homogeneity, and bioactive capacity. The injectable hydrogel (CTDP) with sufficient modulus (∼180 Pa) exhibits rapid self-healing (∼7 min), shear-thinning injectability (30 gauge), and a uniform porous structure. In vitro, CTDP hydrogel significantly scavenges reactive oxygen species, promotes neural stem cell proliferation, and polarizes macrophages from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. The CTDP hydrogel is injected into the brains of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD rats, demonstrating motor function restoration, dopaminergic neuron loss reduction, and suppression of neuroinflammation. Network pharmacology and molecular docking are employed to assist in screening for RIPK1-NF-κB-IκBα pathway as a key therapeutic mechanism. The bioactive injectable CTDP hydrogel provides a simple nanoparticle modification strategy integrated with advanced nanoscale characterization protocols while offering the possibility to explore the therapeutic mechanisms of composite biomaterials with network pharmacology and molecular docking, giving new concepts for the assessment of biomaterial preparations as well as for the treatment of PD.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Purpose
An increased prevalence of peripheral polyneuropathy (PN) in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with greater functional impairment has previously been reported. A possible cause has been suggested as levodopa therapy. The aim of this real-world study was to assess the prevalence and the characteristics of PN in PD and to investigate the putative association between PN and oral levodopa.
Methods
A cohort of 692 consecutive patients with idiopathic PD had routine clinical, laboratory, and lower limb clinical neurophysiology assessment when attending the certified tertiary Parkinson center, Schön Klinik Neustadt, Neustadt in Holstein, Germany, between 2016 and 2019. Patients were sent by general neurologists for the medication adjustment, physiotherapy, ergotherapy, and logopaedic treatment. A retrospective cross-sectional review of the data was performed.
Findings
The mean age of the cohort was 72.6 (8.44) years (range, 44–90 years) and 60% were male. The age of the first PD manifestation was 65.22 (10.09) years (range, 31–88 years). Of 692 patients with PD, 507 (73.27%) had clinical signs of neuropathy and PN was first diagnosed 6.3 (5.7) years after the PD onset. Of these 507 patients, 446 (87.96%) underwent the electrophysiological investigations with PN confirmed in 396 patients (88.79% out of 446 electrophysiologically investigated patients with PD). Peripheral polyneuropathy was ruled out in 50 patients (11.21% of 446 electrophysiologically investigated patients with PD). The half of patients had moderate and severe sensory axonal PN (201 patients or 53.03% of all 396 with confirmed PN). The mean motor examination part of the Movement Disorders Society's Unified PD Rating Scale score in patients with PN was significantly higher (off, 30.48 [11.60] points; on, 19.92 [10.27] points), than in patients without PN (off, 27.17 [14.57] points; on, 17.14 [11.98] points), with P < 0.01 in the both off and on states. The mean levodopa daily dosage was similar in patients with PN and without PN (565 mg vs 556 mg, P = nonsignificant). No difference between other dopaminergic medication in PN and non-PN group was found.
Implications
PN is highly prevalent in patients with PD. There was no association between oral levodopa or other dopaminergic medication and PN. More awareness of PN in PD clinics and further understanding of the pathophysiology, which leads to the development of an axonal polyneuropathy in PD, are required.

Abstract: As global aging becomes an increasingly pressing issue, the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson’s disease (PD) continue to rise. Wearable devices, particularly flexible pressure sensors (FPSs), possess considerable potential in facilitating PD rehabilitation. However, to provide effective support for PD patients, FPSs must meet higher and more comprehensive standards regarding material composition, structural design, and performance metrics. This study presents a biocompatible, biodegradable, and high-performance ionic capacitive FPS. The sensor features conductive silver paste-coated starch gel electrodes with fingerprint-like microstructures, and employs an electrospun ionic liquid (IL)-doped dextran nanofiber membrane as the dielectric layer. Experimental results indicate that this sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 13.7 kPa−1 within a pressure range of 0–2 kPa, with a response/recovery time of 22/15 ms, a detection limit as low as 10 Pa, and excellent durability, sustaining performance over 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the sensor demonstrates outstanding biocompatibility (99 % cell viability) and biodegradability (fully degrading within 36 hours). Combined the sensor with convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm and an embedded system, a PD severity grading and rehabilitation assessment system was developed, achieving accuracy of over 95 %. This system can provide personalized treatment plans for PD patients, advancing health monitoring and rehabilitation for the elderly, and holds promising applications in the future healthcare sector.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological changes, including the loss of dopaminergic neurons and abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn). Certain cellular and molecular events are involved; however, the origin and significance of these events remain uncertain. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) predicted to play a pivotal role in various regulatory processes has emerged. Studies on the dysregulation of miRNAs in PD pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment have recently gained attention. This review aims to encapsulate recent research developments concerning the function of miRNAs in the pathophysiology of PD and their prospective applications as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers, targets, and pharmaceuticals. The most effective drug delivery approach for the treatment of PD, transnasal-cerebral drug delivery, has also been briefly described. The advantage of this delivery strategy is its capacity to bypass the blood–brain barrier, enabling direct administration of medication to the brain, which improves therapeutic efficacy and minimizes side effects.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. Recent studies have proved that gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis exists in PD patients. However, the causal relationship between gut microbial dysbiosis and pathogenesis of PD remains unexplored. Here, using MPTP/probenecid-induced PD mouse model and an antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-induced pseudo-germ-free status, we observed that GM diversity and abundance significantly decreased in feces of ABX-treated PD mice by 16S rRNA sequencing. Remarkably, gut microbial dysbiosis induced by ABX aggravated GI dysfunction and motor deficits in PD mice. Moreover, ABX treatment caused more severe inflammation, and dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal loss in both the gut and brain. Further study showed that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) corrected gut microbial dysbiosis, along with increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, GI and motor dysfunctions were improved, peripheral and central inflammation were also attenuated when PD mice were treated with FMT. These findings revealed that gut microbial dysbiosis could aggravate PD pathological damages, and highlighted that gut microbial dysbiosis might be an important factor that impacts PD pathogenesis through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder characterized by predominantly motor symptoms. However, recent research has broadened our understanding of PD by revealing its impact on non-motor functions, including ocular manifestations. This review explored the intricate relationship between PD and ocular health, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying common ocular diseases such as dry eye disease, cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. It also underscores the importance of recognizing ocular manifestations as potential early markers of PD, as well as their impact on patients' daily activities, necessitating prompt identification and intervention to prevent complications and enhance the overall quality of life. Furthermore, future research should prioritize unraveling the potential association between PD and other prevalent ocular diseases, such as myopia, to formulate effective treatment strategies.

Abstract: Objective
To understand what Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients report in their own words about their mood and anxiety problems using the Parkinson's Disease Patient Report of Problems (PD-PROP).
Methods
Patient-reported data from the PD-PROP (reporting most bothersome problems due to PD in their own words), Geriatric Depression Scale, MDS-UPDRS II, and the Euro-Q0L from the Fox Insight research database (https://foxinsight.michaeljfox.org/) were examined using cross-sectional comparisons and logistic regression analyses to characterize non-depressive mood symptoms and anxiety.
Results
We identified 21,487 participants who completed at least one PD-PROP questionnaire. Four categories of non-depressive mood symptoms (Anxiety/Worry, Loneliness/Isolation, Negative Emotions NOS (Not Otherwise Specified), Death/Suicidal Ideation) were identified. Women were much more likely than men to report non-depressive mood symptoms as a bothersome PD-related problem. The frequency of Anxiety/Worry reporting decreased with longer duration of PD while Loneliness/Isolation increased. More severe PD motor impairment, as measured by the MDS-UPDRS II, was associated with increased reporting of Negative Emotions and Loneliness/Isolation. Higher Euro-QoL, indicating better quality of life, was associated with decreased reporting of Loneliness/Isolation. Death/Suicidal Ideation was only reported by a small number of participants (<0.5 %).
Conclusions
Women were more likely than men with PD to identify Anxiety/Worry, Negative Emotions, and Loneliness/Isolation as problems. This finding and the higher prevalence of bothersome loneliness/isolation as PD duration increases can guide monitoring for these issues.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) often causes visual changes that impair visuospatial processing, reading speed, and contrast acuity, impacting patients’ quality of life.
Objectives
This study aimed to investigate the effects of levodopa and deep brain stimulation (DBS) on visual symptoms associated with PD.
Methods
Patients were assessed either before DBS surgery (both off and on medication) or at their first DBS programming session (off medication, with and without stimulation). The King-Devick reading speed and color contrast visual tests were administered in each condition, evaluating high and low contrast across black, red, and yellow.
Results
Reading speed and color contrast acuity did not change following levodopa dosing or when deep brain stimulation was off or on. However, those patients that had testing before and after DBS showed a non-significant trend towards improvement in their rapid reading test scores from pre-DBS to post-DBS and black color contrast sensitivity using the 2.5% contrast.
Conclusions
Although levodopa and DBS did not significantly improve reading speed or contrast acuity after single dosing or turning DBS on and off, in this small study, these findings provide valuable insights into the stability of these visual symptoms under current treatments. There was evidence that DBS surgery may improve certain aspects of reading speed and contrast acuity and further study is needed. This work underscores the need for innovative approaches to enhance visual function in PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with no currently available effective treatments. Muscone is a bioactive compound extracted from musk, a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, that has demonstrated notable pharmacological properties and is considered beneficial for various models of neurological disorders. However, no studies have in vestigated the potential link between muscone and PD. This study tested the neuroprotective properties and mechanisms of muscone in a PD model. The behavioral findings revealed that muscone significantly improved motor deficits in PD mice while Cell Counting Kit-8 testing suggested that muscone substantially elevated cell viability in PD cellular models. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis demonstrated that muscone alleviated the degeneration of dopamine neurons in PD model mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that muscone obstructs multiple routes of ferroptosis to alleviate symptoms of PD, indicating its potential to decrease iron accumulation, mitigate reactive oxygen species, inhibit lipid peroxidation, and augment antioxidant capacity. Moreover, bioinformatics study revealed that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) is a vital target for muscone in the suppression of ferroptosis and is crucial in the treatment of PD. GSK-3β activity was significantly increased in both animal and cellular models of PD, while the expression of its principal downstream component, β-catenin, was diminished. However, muscone ameliorated these changes. Intracellular overexpression of GSK-3β subsequently nullified the protective effects of muscone on PD cell models and promoted ferroptosis in PD models by increasing iron levels, augmenting lipid peroxidation, and reducing antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, muscone can inhibit GSK-3β, alter ferroptosis, and confer protection against PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is second most common neurodegenerative disorder. With the increasing worldwide aging population, prevalence is also expected to increase dramatically. The clinical symptoms of PD can be divided into non-motor and motor symptoms. The non-motor symptoms start earlier in the disease course before the onset of motor symptoms. The treatment of motor symptoms of PD began with the use of anticholinergics many decades ago before the milestone treatment with levodopa was discovered in the 1960s. Several dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic drugs have been developed. Focus has also shifted to the treatment of non-motor symptoms. Besides oral therapy, continuous infusion therapy, ablation therapy, and neuromodulator therapy have also been developed. Now the focus is changing from symptomatic treatments to decreasing the progression or curing the disease.

Abstract: Objective
The aim of this work was to study the differences at the whole-brain level between self-paced and cued movement processing in Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Methods
High density electroencephalogram (HD-EEG) was recorded during the performance of self-paced movements (Bereitschaftspotential − BP) and visually cued movements (VMT) in PD patients (n = 38) and in a group of healthy controls (HC, n = 23). Oscillatory changes in the alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies were evaluated and correlated to the clinical scales- MDS-UPDRS and Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ).
Results
The main difference in the alpha range was an activation in the basal ganglia area during VMT performance as compared to BP performance; this activation was present only in HC. The most important finding was observed in the high beta range: a higher activation of the right postcentral area during BP performance in PD subjects as compared to HC, correlating to the severity of FOG. Moreover, PD patients had lower gamma activation of the right frontal areas.
Conclusion
A simplification of motor circuits and a hyperactivation of the right somatosensory cortex were observed in PD subjects.
Significance
Future studies should be focused on this area to confirm or disprove its role in FOG.

Abstract: Objective
Parkinson's Disease (PD) manifests with both motor and non-motor symptoms, with non-motor symptoms often appearing first. The link between non-motor symptoms, particularly depression, and olfactory dysfunction, and substantia nigra (SN) subregions has been studied less. By utilizing Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we investigated the associations between microstructural patterns in the SN’s subregions and motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with PD, including those without evident dopaminergic deficits, compared to healthy controls (HC).
Methods
Complete baseline demographic data, motor assessments, full-scale non-motor tests, and DTI of SN subregions for 260 participants, including 156 with PD, 36 with scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD), and 68 HC, were extracted from the PPMI database. Multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the associations between symptom scores and DTI findings.
Results
A significant difference in depression between the groups was found (p < 0.01), with patients with SWEDD having the highest rate of depression (approximately 36.1 %). Depressed SWEDD patients, compared to non-depressed ones, had higher FA values in the right rostral part of SN (p = 0.03, adjusted p = 0.15). Anxiety scores were significantly higher in both PD and SWEDD groups compared to HCs. PD patients exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction compared to SWEDD and HCs (p < 0.001, adjusted p = 0.03), with 54.5 % of PD patients experiencing hyposmia and 34 % of them suffering from anosmia. PD patients with normosmia and hyposmia had higher FA in the right caudal SN than those with anosmia.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest significant brain microstructural differences in SN associated with depression and olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD with or without evident dopaminergic deficits. This finding highlights the advantage of DTI in detecting microstructural changes in patients with SWEDD.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder in which dopaminergic neurons progressively degenerate, resulting in impaired dopamine system function. The release and uptake of dopamine (DA) are modulated, in part, by free, ionic zinc (Zn2+), an essential signaling metal. Although alterations in Zn2+ homeostasis are implicated in PD, the influence of Zn2+ on DA release and uptake that occurs within the subsecond time frame has not been studied in PD, or other disorders. In this study, we combined caged-compound photolysis with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) at carbon-fiber microelectrodes to investigate the impact of Zn2+ photorelease on DA release and reuptake in PD-model zebrafish, generated by chronic treatment with rotenone, and vehicle-treated control fish. Our findings reveal that Zn2+ photorelease inhibited peak DA overflow by about 20% in brains from PD model fish but not in those from vehicle-treated fish. Further analysis of the stimulated release plots showed a significant decrease in the first order rate constant of uptake (k) and an increase in the half-life (t 1/2) in brains from vehicle-treated fish but not in those from PD model fish. These differences were not apparent when waiting more than 200 ms to electrically stimulate the brain after the end of light application. Treatment with the free-radical scavenger TEMPOL reversed the effect of Zn2+ photorelease on DA release but not on DA uptake. Thus, oxidative stress likely plays a key role, acting reversibly on DA release and irreversibly on DA uptake. In summary, our study demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the effects of metal ions on Parkinson’s disease.

Abstract: Background
The association between serum potassium and prodromal Parkinson’s disease (PPD) remains unclear currently.
Objective
The ultimate goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the implications of this association between serum potassium and PPD.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study involving 1035 participants in PPMI cohort. Age, sex, education years, race, body mass index (BMI), calcium, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lymphocytes, neutrophils, serum uric acid, serum sodium, serum potassium, creatinine, serum glucose were obtained from all participants. Logistic regression, and smooth curve fitting were utilized to substantiate the research objectives.
Results
The overall PPD was 83.4 % (863/1035). Multivariate odds ratio regression adjusted for risk factors demonstrates a 1-unit increment in the serum potassium raises the risk of PPD by 1.82 times, respectively. Smooth splines analysis suggested an inverted U-shaped association between serum potassium and PPD (P nonlinearity < 0.05), with the zenith of risk at 4.479 mmol/L. Further subgroup analysis and sensitivity analyses supported the primary findings and indicated the conclusions are robust.
Conclusions
This study highlights the association between serum potassium levels and the risk of incident PPD, independent of confounders. The association between serum potassium and PPD is inverted U-shaped, the threshold value is 4.479 mmol/l.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms. Recently, dance has started to be considered an effective intervention for people with PD. Several findings in the literature emphasize the necessity for deeper exploration into the synergistic impacts of dance therapy and exergaming for PD management. Moreover, socially engaging robotic platforms equipped with advanced interaction and perception features offer potential for monitoring patients’ posture and enhancing workout routines with tailored cues.
Objective
This paper presents the results of the Social Robotics for Active and Healthy Ageing (SI-Robotics) project, aimed at designing an innovative rehabilitation program targeted at seniors affected by (early-stage) PD. This study therefore aims to assess the usefulness of a dance-based rehabilitation program enriched by artificial intelligence–based exergames and contextual robotic assistance in improving motor function, balance, gait, and quality of life in patients with PD. The acceptability of the system is also investigated.
Methods
The study is designed as a technical feasibility pilot to test the SI-Robotics system. For this study, 20 patients with PD were recruited. A total of 16 Irish dance–based rehabilitation sessions of 50 minutes were conducted (2 sessions per week, for 8 wks), involving 2 patients at a time. The designed rehabilitation session involves three main actors: (1) a therapist, (2) a patient, and (3) a socially interacting robot. To stimulate engagement, sessions were organized in the shape of exergames where an avatar shows patients the movements they should perform to correctly carry out a dance-based rehabilitation exercise.
Results
Statistical analysis reveals a significant difference on the Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment scale, both on balance and gait aspects, together with improvements in Short Physical Performance Battery, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale–III, and Timed Up and Go test, underlying the usefulness of the rehabilitation intervention on the motor symptoms of PD. The analysis of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology subscales provided valuable insights into users’ perceptions and interactions with the system.
Conclusions
This research underscores the promise of merging dance therapy with interactive exergaming on a robotic platform as an innovative strategy to enhance motor function, balance, gait, and overall quality of life for patients grappling with PD.

Abstract: Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Homocysteine (Hcy) is converted to Hcy thiolactone (HTL) in error-editing reactions catalyzed by methionine-tRNA synthetase (MARS). HTL forms isopeptide bonds with lysine residues of target proteins in a process known as N-homocysteinylation (N-Hcy), which contributes to the neurotoxicity of Hcy in PD pathogenesis. Thus, MARS may represent a potential target for controlling hyperhomocysteinemia-associated neurotoxicity. Here we tested the effect of MARS on protein N-Hcy in cultured cells, MPTP-induced mouse model of PD, and mice injected with α-synuclein PFFs. We found that the protein N-Hcy levels were increased in the brains of PD model mice. MARS knockdown ameliorates protein N-Hcy, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and α-synuclein aggregation in cells. MARS knockdown also alleviated dopaminergic neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits in mice injected with MPTP. In mice injected with α-synuclein fibrils, MARS knockdown attenuated α-synuclein aggregation, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and motor impairments. These results indicate that inhibition of MARS attenuates PD-like pathology induced by hyperhomocysteinemia.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multisystem, chronic and so far, incurable disease affecting millions of people worldwide. With the continuing need for better therapeutic options for PD, there is a global renewed interest in cell replacement therapy due to progress in using pluripotent stem cells as an unlimited source of dopaminergic (DA) neurons for cell transplantation. Despite the significant progress made, obstacles remain that interfere with the restoration of functional circuits by DA grafts. The functional connectivity between DA grafts and host cells may be enhanced by adjunctive therapies, such as physical activity. Exercise modalities, such as use of treadmill, enhance neuroplasticity and improve motor and cognitive functions in PD patients. The patients are able to re-learn movement and adjust their posture, which, in turn, results in short term-reduced rigidity and improved stride length and cadence. By stabilizing selected active inputs and eliminating inactive ones, activity-dependent mechanisms fine-tune new neural circuits for optimal connection and physiological function. This communication will review the mechanisms and synergies between cell replacement therapy and physical and cognitive training to enhance induced pluripotent stem cell-mediated functional reinnervation of the striatum in PD.

Abstract: Standard classifiers struggle with high-dimensional datasets due to increased computational complexity, difficulty in visualization and interpretation, and challenges in handling redundant or irrelevant features. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method based on the Mahalanobis distance for Parkinson's disease (PD) classification. The proposed feature selection identifies relevant features by measuring their distance from the dataset's mean vector, considering the covariance structure. Features with larger Mahalanobis distances are deemed more relevant as they exhibit greater discriminative power relative to the dataset's distribution, aiding in effective feature subset selection. Significant improvements in classification performance were observed across all models. On the "Parkinson Disease Classification Dataset", the feature set was reduced from 22 to 11 features, resulting in accuracy improvements ranging from 10.17 % to 20.34 %, with the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 98.31 %. Similarly, on the "Parkinson Dataset with Replicated Acoustic Features", the feature set was reduced from 45 to 18 features, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 1.38 % to 13.88 %, with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieving the best accuracy of 95.83 %. By identifying convergence features and eliminating divergence features, the proposed method effectively reduces dimensionality while maintaining or improving classifier performance. Additionally, the proposed feature selection method significantly reduces execution time, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in medical diagnostics, where timely and accurate disease identification is critical for improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the world. A progressive disease, which can worsen over time and lead to complications like mild cognitive impairments and dementia. The accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) remains a critical challenge in medical engineering. This study explores the potential of brain wave patterns for PD detection in healthy and unhealthy patients. The Power Spectral Density (PSD) and proposed PD detection model based on the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is used to analyze brain activities. It was found that the detection of PD in patients was improved by classifying the RAW EEG in conjunction with the sub-bands using PSD as a feature and GRU as a classifier. The performance matrices including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score fall within a range of 90% to 98% for alpha, beta, and gamma sub-bands, while the area under the curve in the case of receiver operating characteristics curve achieved the maximum value of 1.00. To assess the differences between the groups with Parkinson’s disease and the healthy group, a statistical significance test was performed. The power spectral density of the two groups differed statistically significantly, according to the results, indicating that they could be useful as biomarkers for the identification of Parkinson’s disease. The results are compared and validated with the standard performance measures.

Abstract: Objective
Given the uncertainty surrounding the most effective exercise prescription variables (frequency, intensity, type, duration) and the impact of Parkinson’s disease (PD) characteristics (illness duration, age, severity, baseline cognitive status, levodopa dosage) on different subdomains of executive function (EF) improvement, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with moderator analysis to assess these effects.
Method
Six electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, AGELINE) were searched by two independent authors. Clinical trials published before April 2024 that reported the effect of chronic exercise on EF in individuals with PD were included.
Results
Of 608 identified studies, 18 studies met eligibility criteria. The overall effect size (ES) of exercise on EF was small but positive and significant (ES= 0.21, p < .001). Among EF subdomains, cognitive flexibility showed significant improvement. Regarding exercise prescription, larger ES were observed for high (≥2 per week) frequency, moderate to vigorous intensity, mind-body exercise, and 45–60 min for each session. Sample characteristics such as older age, high levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) (≥600 mg/day), and baseline cognitive impairment were found to attenuate the effect of exercise on EF.
Conclusion
Exercise is a promising non-pharmacological intervention for enhancing EF in PD, particularly improving cognitive flexibility. Mind-body exercises appear particularly effective. Recommended programs should be moderate to vigorous in intensity, lasting 45–60 min, and conducted at least twice weekly for 13–16 weeks. The benefits of exercise diminish with age and with LEDD exceeding 600 mg/day. Additionally, PD patients with cognitive impairments may experience reduced benefits. Early exercise engagement is recommended, while disease severity and duration have minimal impact.

Abstract: Introduction
The interaction between frailty and Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unknown. This study aimed to study the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary telemedicine program in reducing frailty in Parkinson's disease.
Methods
Longitudinal, randomized, case-control study. All participants in the office were evaluated at baseline, four, and eight months (V0, V1, and V2). Patients included in the telemedicine program received additional multidisciplinary care with nurse, neurologist, and occupational therapist interventions from V0 to V1. PD motor, non-motor symptoms, frailty and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) were assessed using recommended PD rating scales.
Results
Fifty patients were included, 25 patients in the telemedicine group, and 25 patients in the control group. Frailty was highly correlated with performance in activities of daily living, and freezing of gait, balance, gait speed, and motor impairment, moderately correlated with hand grip strength, number of daily steps, and HR-QoL, and slightly correlated with age and level of physical fatigue. Frailty was reduced in the telemedicine group, compared to the control group, from V0 to V1 (p = .0001) and from V0 to V2 (p = .007). In addition, gait freezing, balance, gait speed, fatigue, non-motor symptoms, and HR-QoL were also improved in the telemedicine group (p values < .05).
Conclusion
By leveraging multidisciplinary telemedicine interventions in addition to in-office visits, healthcare providers can deliver patient-centric care, improving frailty, non-motor symptoms, gait impairment, and quality of life in Parkinson's disease. These hybrid interventions could solve current barriers to health systems with limited capacity.

Abstract: Background
Walking and balance impairments, represented by freezing of gait and falls, are significant contributors to disability in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, the composite measure of the Walking and Balance Milestone (WBMS) has not been thoroughly investigated.
Methods
This study included 606 early-stage PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, with a disease duration of less than 2 years and no WBMS at baseline. Patients were divided into a model development cohort (70 %) and a validation cohort (30 %) according to the enrollment site. Longitudinal follow-up data over a period of 12 years were analyzed.
Results
Among all 606 patients, the estimated probability of being WBMS-free at the 5th and 10th year was 88 % and 60 %, respectively. Five clinical variables (Age, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) score, Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part I (MDS-UPDRS-I) score, and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) were used to construct the Cox predictive model. The C-index of the model was 0.75 in the development cohort and 0.76 in the validation cohort. By optimizing the PIGD and MDS-UPDRS-I variables, an easy-to-use model was achieved with comparable predictive performance.
Conclusion
A predictive model based on five baseline clinical measures (Age, SDMT, PIGD score, MDS-UPDRS-I score, RBD) could effectively estimate the risk of the WBMS in early PD patients. This model is valuable for prognostic counseling and clinical intervention trials for gait and balance impairment.

Novel Voice Signal Segmentation Based on Clark Distance to Improve Intelligent Parkinson Disease Detection,

Abstract: Summary
This paper presents a novel classifier based on the Clark distance for early detection of Parkinson’s disease (PD) using voice data. The nonlinear nature of human voice signals and their inherent fluctuations pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR), which struggle to capture meaningful relationships within the voice data for accurate classification. The proposed classifier addresses these limitations by segmenting the data features of each voice sample into smaller blocks (ranging in size from 2 to 10 features per block), to better capture relationships and minimize fluctuations that negatively impact classification accuracy. To further enhance the performance of the classifier, Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) was integrated to select high-harmony (convergent) features while removing irrelevant and redundant (divergent) features. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 94.6% without GWO and an impressive 98.305% accuracy with GWO, using only 12 selected features. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates efficient execution time, making it well-suited for real-time applications in medical organizations. The combination of the Clark distance classifier with GWO not only improves classification accuracy but also ensures computational efficiency, enabling its deployment in diverse settings such as hospitals and home monitoring systems for early detection and continuous monitoring of PD patients. This study highlights the potential of the proposed approach as a reliable, cost-effective, and scalable solution for voice-based PD detection.

Abstract: Objectives
Psychosis remains problematic in patients with Parkinson's disease and sleep disorders are frequent non-motor symptoms of PD. Few research studies have correctly assessed objective sleep architecture to determine the association between psychosis and sleep disorders. A mobile two-channel electroencephalography (EEG)/electrooculography (EOG) recording system is a self-applicable and affordable method for objectively measuring sleep at home. We studied patients with PD who were enrolled in ZEAL study of the randomized placebo-control clinical trial investigating the efficacy of zonisamide for sleep disorders to determine whether sleep disorders and psychosis are related by using the EEG/EOG recording system.
Methods
24 independent variables were evaluated and variables with a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) to psychosis on univariate logistic regression analyses were entered into multivariate logistic regression analysis using forced entry.
Results
Forty-one patients with PD with no missing data, in both the potable EEG/EOG recording device and subjective clinical characteristics before the initiation of zonisamide, were analyzed. The major result was the reduced total sleep time (TST) and time spent in REM sleep, identified by univariate logistic regression analysis, in PD patients with psychosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified nocturnal PD symptoms on the PDSS as a significant risk factor for psychosis (OR 1.409, 95 %CI 1.073–1.850; p = 0.014).
Conclusion
Our findings reveal that the nocturnal PD symptoms that affect regular home-based sleep may be associated with psychosis.

Abstract: ABSTRACT

Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) with probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (PD-RBD), a specific subtype of PD, are characterized by the presence of more severe motor and non-motor symptoms. This study aimed to elucidate the characteristics and interactions of gut microbiota and plasma metabolic characteristics of PD-RBD, thus screening for the disease mechanisms. A total of 100 PD patients, 50 healthy controls (HCs) and 16 probable idiopathic RBD (iRBD) patients were collected. There were 33 PD-RBD and 67 patients without probable RBD (PD-nRBD) in PD patients. DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and high-throughput sequencing were used for intestinal microbiota analysis, and ultra-high liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for metabolome analysis. Spearman analysis was applied to investigate the correlation of fecal microbiota and plasma metabolome. Our findings revealed Lactobacillaceae (P = 0.017), Christensenellaceae (P = 0.017), Fusobacteriaceae (P = 0.018), Lactobacillus (P = 0.035), Christensenellaceae R-7 group (P = 0.035), and Fusobacterium (P = 0.035) were significantly different in PD-RBD, PD-nRBD, and HC. Moreover, the differential metabolites identified in both PD-nRBD and PD-RBD were 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate (VIP = 5.802) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate (VIP = 5.732). Furthermore, our analysis revealed that 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol sulfate showed a positive correlation with Lactobacillus (r = 0.197, P = 0.049). Finally, functional analysis indicated that these distinctive microbiota and metabolites were primarily associated with phenylalanine metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism. We managed to show that the differential microbiota, differential metabolites, and their interactions in PD-RBD compared to PD-nRBD and HC. This furthers our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and offers fresh perspectives on its detection and treatment.
IMPORTANCE
There are currently fewer investigations on the intestinal microbiota and metabolites of probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (PD-RBD) and idiopathic RBD (iRBD). Our findings indicate that PD-RBD exhibits an increase in Christensenellaceae and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol sulfate, and that iRBD exhibits a similar trend. This suggests that the PD prodromal stage may have seen this alteration. Furthermore, functional analysis indicated that these distinctive microbiota and metabolites were primarily associated with phenylalanine metabolism and vitamin B6 metabolism. Basic experiments and multi-center, large-cohort clinical researches are worth conducting to confirm this, since they may offer insights for treating individuals with PD-RBD.

Abstract: Objective
This study investigated the effects of acute aerobic exercise on gait function and cortical activity during single and dual-task walking in people with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD).
Methods
Thirty PwPD were randomly assigned to the Experimental (EG) and Control Group (CG). Both groups completed a single 40-minute session of cycling. Exercise intensity was maintained at 65–70% of the maximum heart rate for EG and within 5% of the resting heart rate for CG. Participants performed five walking trials under each condition before and after exercise. EEG and accelerometers measured cortical activity and gait parameters.
Results
In the post- vs. pre-exercise, the EG increased gamma power in the C and CP channels during single and dual-task walking. Increased step length during dual-task condition was positively associated with increased gamma power at the C and CP channels.
Conclusion
Acute exercise enhances movement control and sensorimotor integration during walking, evidenced by increased gamma power. Changes in gamma power in the motor/sensorimotor areas may improve step length during dual-task walking.
Significance
This study underscores the potential of aerobic exercise to increase the involvement of motor and sensorimotor cortical regions, highlighting the relevance of aerobic exercise in the neurorehabilitation and gait functions in PwPD.

Abstract: The study analyzed the association of area-level socioeconomic status (SES) with the risk of all-cause dementia, Parkinson's Disease (PD), and all-cause mortality using a multistate approach. Data from the UK Biobank were used (N = 363,663 50+y individuals, ≤15y follow-up), and Cox proportional hazards and multistate parametric models including Weibull regression were conducted, while cardiovascular health was tested as a potential mediator. In multistate models, socioeconomic area-level deprivation, measured by the Townsend Deprivation Index (TDI) z-score, was positively associated with the hazard of going from healthy into the 3 states of PD, dementia, and all-cause mortality (i.e. transitions 1: HR = 1.06, 95 % CI:1.02–1.10, P = 0.005, 2: HR = 1.19, 95 % CI: 1.16–1.22, P < 0.001 and 3: HR = 1.19, 95 % CI: 1.18–1.21, P < 0.001), with no association detected for transitions 4 (PD→Dementia), 5 (PD→Death), or 6 (Dementia→Death). Cardiovascular health did not mediate these associations. Socioeconomic area-level deprivation was directly associated with reduced survival rates from Healthy into Dementia, PD and Death.

Disease progression starts when dopaminergic neurons begin to die. In PD, the loss of neurotransmitter, dopamine is responsible for the overall communication of neural cells throughout the body. Clinical symptoms of PD are slowness of movement, involuntary muscular contractions, speech & writing changes, lessened automatic movement, and chronic tremors in the body. PD occurs in both familial and sporadic forms and modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and socioeconomic conditions cause PD. Early detectable diagnostics and treatments have been developed in the last several decades. However, we still do not have precise early detectable biomarkers and therapeutic agents/drugs that prevent and/or delay the disease process. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) science and machine learning tools have been promising in identifying early detectable markers with a greater rate of accuracy compared to past forms of treatment and diagnostic processes. Artificial intelligence refers to the intelligence exhibited by machines or software, distinct from the intelligence observed in humans that is based on neural networks in a form and can be used to diagnose the longevity and disease severity of disease. The term Machine Learning or Neural Networks is a blanket term used to identify an emerging technology that is created to work in the way of a “human brain” using many intertwined neurons to achieve the same level of raw intelligence as that of a brain. These processes have been used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, to assess the severity of the patient’s condition. In the current article, we discuss the prevalence and incidence of PD, and currently available diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We also highlighted currently available artificial intelligence science and machine learning tools and their applications to detect disease and develop therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disease resulting from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Familial and sporadic forms of the disease have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Pathology has been identified with mutations in the PARK6 gene encoding PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1), a quality control protein in the mitochondria. Disease-associated mutations at the transmembrane (TM) region of PINK1 protein were predicted to disrupt the cleavage of the TM region by the PARL (presenilin-associated rhomboid-like) protease at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here, using microscopy, kinetic analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations, we analyzed three Parkinson’s disease–associated TM mutations; PINK1-C92F, PINK1-R98W, and PINK1-I111S, and found that mitochondrial localization and cleavage by the PARL protease were not significantly impaired. However, clearance of hydrolyzed PINK1-R98W appears to be compromised because of altered positioning of the protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane, preventing association with translocase of the outer membrane complexes and slowing cleavage by PARL. This single amino acid change slows degradation of proteolyzed PINK1, increasing its accumulation at the outer mitochondrial membrane and resulting in increased mitophagy and decreased mitochondrial content among these cells.

Abstract: Glycation is an inevitable nonenzymatic covalent reaction between nucleophilic groups in proteins and nucleotides, and endogenous reducing sugars or dicarbonyls (e.g., methylglyoxal) leading to protein and/or nucleotide covalent modifications. This process initiates a series of dehydrations, oxidations and rearrangements that lead to a myriad of products called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Previously, we showed that Park7 (or DJ-1) is a protein deglycase that repairs methylglyoxal-glycated biomolecules by acting on early glycation intermediates and releasing the repaired biomolecule and lactate. Moreover, the PARK7 gene is associated with recessive and sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, over the last few years, the function of Park7 has become an important research topic for understanding the etiology of PD. In this context, the development of sensitive enzymatic assays is crucial to quantify the activity of Park7 and develop specific modulators. Here, we describe a new method for measuring Park7 activity based on the separation and quantification of glycated and unglycated fluorescent nucleotides by Liquid Chromatography (LC). Kinetic and mechanistic analyses using human recombinant Park7 confirmed the reliability of this approach. In addition, this assay was further validated using cellular lysates. Our results indicate that this novel Park7 assay is simple, sensitive, and specific.

Abstract: Background
Neurodegenerative diseases are mainly a consequence of degenerated proteins in neurons. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and is characterized by Lewy body deposition. Autophagy is known as one of the cell maintenance mechanisms. Autophagy targets are damaged or degenerated macromolecules and organelles for lysosomal degradation. The role of disrupted autophagy in PD was established earlier. In this regard, the current study aimed to evaluate the frequency and status of the autophagy gene polymorphisms in PD by a systematic review approach.
Materials and methods
In the current study, electronic databases including Scopus, PubMed, and Science Direct were used for the search. The search was performed by using Parkinson’s disease, autophagy, autophagy-related gene, ATG, Single-nucleotide polymorphisms, variant, Sequence variants, and with a date limitation of 2010 to 2023. All original research papers in the English language that evaluate the ATG polymorphisms in PD were included in the study.
Results
The conducted search leads to 2626 primary studies screened based on the inclusion criteria. After the screening stage, 8 studies were included. ATG7 rs1375206 and ATG5 rs510432, rs573775 and rs17587319 were associated with PD. However, some other polymorphisms in ATGs that were not associated with PD were listed.
Conclusion
In conclusion, regardless of the critical role of autophagy in PD pathogenesis, it seems that ATG16 and ATG7 polymorphisms are not associated with PD; however, ATG7 rs1375206 needs more evaluation for a clearer conclusion in future studies. ATG5 and ATG12 polymorphisms seem to be more important in PD. More comprehensive studies about all ATG5, 7, 12, and 16 seem to be urgently required for a conclusive judgment about their role in PD or even other neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative motor disorders worldwide with postural instability, bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity being the most common symptoms of the disease. Despite the fact that the molecular mechanisms of Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis have already been well described, there is still no coherent picture of the etiopathogenesis of this disease. According to modern concepts, neurodegeneration is induced mainly by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, dysregulation of cerebral proteostasis, apoptotic dysregulation, and impaired autophagy. This review describes how various factors contribute to neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease. Understanding the factors affecting fundamental cellular processes and responsible for disease progression may help develop therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from the disease. The review also discusses the role of calpains in the development of Parkinson’s disease. It is known that α-synuclein is a substrate of calcium-dependent proteases of the calpain family. Truncated forms of α-synuclein are not only involved in the process of formation of the aggregates, but also increase their toxicity.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Parkinson’s disease tremor (PDT) is crucial for developing assistive technologies; however, this is challenging due to the nonlinear, stochastic, and nonstationary characteristics of PDT, which substantially vary among patients and their activities. Moreover, most models only have one-step prediction capabilities, which causes delays in real-time applications. This paper proposes a self-attention deep temporal convolutional network (SADTCN) model for the real-time prediction of hand-arm PDT signals from different activities and joint angular motions. The SADTCN can capture both short- and long-term dependencies and complex temporal and spatial dynamics of PDT signals and hence, can effectively adapt to varying tremor characteristics. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using experimental hand-arm PDT data. The results show that the SADTCN outperforms existing deep learning (DL) models by accurately predicting varying tremor amplitudes and frequencies multi-step ahead. Moreover, we performed spectrum analysis on the measured and predicted signal using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) as a measure of potential active tremor control and found that SADTCN can accurately determine the transience of tremor amplitude in frequency and time. Finally, we run the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistical test and the results show a statistically significant improvement in the proposed model over the other DL models in all conditions. Therefore, the SADTCN can overcome the nonstationary, nonlinear, and stochastic nature of PDT to perform multi-step prediction with high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability in unseen testing data.

Abstract: Summary
Objective
Parkinson's disease is the second most common disease of the central nervous system after Alzheimer's disease. Currently, no blood test or other laboratory tests are available to diagnose this condition. One of the practical methods in diagnosing and evaluating the progress of neurodegenerative diseases is the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT), with which it is possible to accurately measure the thickness of the layers of the retina, as well as the thickness and volume of the macula. The goal of this study was to determine the OCT findings in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to the normal population.
Method
This study was conducted in 2019 at the Neurology Clinic of Farshchian Hospital, Hamadan (Iran). Sampling was performed based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study and the required sample size. Patients referred to the Neurology Department of Farshchian Hospital were first examined by a neurologist, then referred to the ophthalmology clinic for a complete ophthalmological examination. OCT imaging was performed by an experienced, skilled optometrist after pupillary dilation with tropicamide drops. RNFL thickness, macula and fovea, and the measured macular volumes were recorded along with other information, including age, sex, disease duration, severity of disease symptoms, and drug use. Finally, the data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 statistical software.
Findings
A total of 103 individuals including 49 males (47.6%) and 54 females (52.4%) with a mean age of 70.66 years were examined. The subjects included two groups, patients (53 subjects) and control (50 subjects), who were matched in terms of age and gender distribution. The mean RNFL thickness and macular thickness and volume in the patient group were significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). There was an inverse relationship between the thickness of the RNFL and the macula with the duration of the disease and the severity of the disease symptoms (P<0.05).
Conclusion
In this study, a significant decrease in RNFL thickness and macular thickness and volume was shown in patients with Parkinson's disease compared to the age- and sex-matched control group. It can be said that the changes in the macula and RNFL in Parkinson's disease and with progression of the disease are suitable markers for diagnosing and investigating the progression of Parkinson's disease.
Résumé
Objectif
La maladie de Parkinson est la deuxième maladie du système nerveux central la plus répandue après la maladie d’Alzheimer. Actuellement, aucun test sanguin ou autre test de laboratoire n’est disponible pour diagnostiquer cette maladie. L’une des méthodes pratiques de diagnostic et d’évaluation de l’évolution des maladies neurodégénératives est l’utilisation de la tomographie par cohérence optique ou OCT, dans laquelle il est possible de vérifier avec précision l’épaisseur des couches nerveuses de la rétine, ainsi que l’épaisseur et le volume de la macula. Le but de cette étude était de déterminer les troubles de l’OCT chez les patients atteints de la maladie de Parkinson par rapport à la population normale.
Méthode
Cette étude a été menée en 2019 à la clinique de neurologie de l’hôpital Farshchian de Hamadan (Iran). L’échantillonnage a été effectué avec la méthode disponible en fonction des critères d’entrée/sortie de l’étude et de la taille d’échantillon requise. Les patients adressés au service de neurologie de l’hôpital Farshchian ont d’abord été examinés par un neurologue, puis ils ont été adressés à la clinique d’ophtalmologie pour un examen ophtalmologique complet. L’imagerie OCT a été réalisée par un optométriste expérimenté et qualifié après dilatation de la pupille avec des gouttes de tropicamide. L’épaisseur du RNFL, la macula et la foa, ainsi que le volume maculaire mesuré ont été enregistrés dans la liste de contrôle avec d’autres informations, notamment l’âge, le sexe, la durée de la maladie, la gravité des symptômes de la maladie et la consommation de médicaments. Enfin, les données ont été analysées à l’aide du logiciel statistique SPSS version 22.
Résultats
Au total, 103 personnes, dont 49 hommes (47,6 %) et 54 femmes (52,4 %), âgées en moyenne de 70,66 ans, ont été examinées. Les sujets comprenaient deux groupes de patients (53 personnes) et de témoins (50 personnes) appariés en termes de répartition par âge et par sexe. L’épaisseur moyenne du RNFL ainsi que l’épaisseur et le volume maculaires dans le groupe de patients étaient significativement inférieurs à ceux du groupe témoin (p<0,05). Il existait une relation inverse entre l’épaisseur du RNFL et de la macula avec la durée de la maladie et la gravité des symptômes de la maladie (p<0,05).
Conclusion
Dans cette étude, une diminution significative de l’épaisseur du RNFL ainsi que de l’épaisseur et du volume maculaires a été mise en évidence chez les patients atteints de la maladie de Parkinson par rapport au groupe témoin apparié. On peut dire que les modifications de la macula et du RNFL au cours de la maladie de Parkinson et avec la progression de la maladie sont des marqueurs appropriés pour diagnostiquer et étudier la progression de la maladie de Parkinson.

Abstract: Introduction
A systematic review on the association of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD) is lacking and the causal relationship remains unclear.
Objective
We aimed to conduct a systematic review of observational studies on the association of mtDNA-CN with AD and PD and perform a bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate their causal relationships.
Methods
PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for eligible studies before Jan 2025. The causal links were conducted with inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the main analysis.
Results
Fourteen case-control and 2 cohort studies investigated the association between mtDNA-CN and AD, with 13 reporting decreased mtDNA-CN associated with increased risk of AD and 3 showing no significant association. All the studies (9 case-control, 1 cross-sectional, 2 cohort studies) observed the relation between mtDNA-CN and PD except for 3 studies reporting no significant association. In MR analysis, genetically predicted mtDNA-CN was not associated with AD and PD, whereas genetically predicted AD (β −0.085, 95 % CI −0.156 to −0.013; P = 0.02) but not PD was associated with mtDNA-CN. Sensitivity and replication analyses showed a stable finding.
Discussion
The systematic review found limited observational studies on mtDNA-CN and AD and PD and majority were case-control study. Findings of the bidirectional MR study did not support a causal effect of mtDNA-CN in the development of AD and PD but found that AD can lead to decreased levels of mtDNA-CN, which suggest mtDNA-CN as a potential biomarker of AD.

Abstract: Cognitive dysfunction is a common nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with alterations in the cortical dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. PD-related cognitive symptoms include impaired executive functions such as working memory. Here, we review the circuit and network systems supporting working memory and how they might malfunction in PD patients. We discuss PD-related changes in working memory networks in the context of disease-specific processes, neurophysiological markers, and novel therapeutic interventions.

Abstract: Large population-based studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) have identified susceptibility genes, including SLC17A5. Biallelic mutations in SLC17A5, encoding the lysosomal sialic acid transporter sialin, cause the rare neurodegenerative disease, free sialic acid storage disorder (FSASD). To explore a potential biochemical link between FSASD and PD, we investigated ganglioside concentrations in a novel mouse model harboring the Slc17a5 p.Arg39Cys (p.R39C) variant. Our analysis revealed no significant alterations in ganglioside concentrations in heterozygous p.R39C mice, warranting further studies into other potential links between PD and sialin defects.

Abstract: The development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases is associated with the accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins. Such proteins are eliminated from cells by proteolytic systems, mainly by 20S proteasomes, whose activity declines with age. Its stimulation has been recognized as a promising approach to delay the onset or ameliorate the symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders. Here we present peptidomimetics that are very effective in stimulating the proteasome in biochemical assays and in cell culture. They are stable in human plasma and capable of penetrating the cell membranes. The activators demonstrated the ability to enhance h20S degradation of α-synuclein and tau, whose aggregates are involved in the development of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, respectively. The peptidomimetics did not show cytotoxicity to HEK293T and primary hippocampal cells. Additionally, these compounds were highly effective in reducing the amount of phosphorylated α-synuclein aggregates in hippocampal neurons in a mouse embryonic cell model.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain, that commonly leads to motor dysfunction and dementia. Artemether is a semi - synthetic derivative of artemisinin, which is extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Artemisia annua. And it is widely used in the treatment of malaria. Recent studies have shown that it exhibits significant neuroprotective effects and holds potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, its effects and mechanisms in the context of Parkinson 's disease remain unclear.
Objective
To explore Artemether's neuroprotective effects and mechanisms in 6-OHDA-induced PD models.
Methods
Network pharmacology and molecular docking were used to predict potential pathways and targets of Artemether against Parkinson's disease. PD models were established using 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells and C57BL/6 mice to assess Artemether's effects and mechanisms.
Results
Through network pharmacological analysis and molecular docking verification, it was found that Artemether against Parkinson 's disease was related to apoptosis-related signaling pathways, and Artemether had good spontaneous binding activity with key targets PI3K, Akt, GSK-3β, and Bcl-2. Furthermore, the related experimental results showed that Artemether could increase the cell viability of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA, reduce intracellular ROS level, increase mitochondrial membrane potential and decrease apoptosis. In addition, Artemether improved motor dysfunction and cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson 's disease mice, and increased the expression of dopamine neurons in both the Substantia Nigra and Striatum.
Conclusion
Artemether exerted neuroprotective effects in Parkinson 's disease models in vitro and in vivo induced by 6-OHDA through the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway.

Abstract: Background
This study aimed to explore the relationship between self-reported sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder [RBD]) and cortical thickness, brainstem volume, amyloid accumulation, and inflammatory markers in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study comparing 100 PD patients (observation group) with 100 age-matched controls. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and serum levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42), α-synuclein, and inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-α, IL-1β) were quantified.
Results
PD patients exhibited significantly poorer sleep quality (PSQI total score: 2.11 ± 0.27 vs. 0.52 ± 0.02, P < 0.001), reduced parietal cortical thickness (2.68 ± 0.12 mm vs. 3.15 ± 0.18 mm, P = 0.003), and lower brainstem volume (2697.42 ± 147.05 mm3 vs. 3185.16 ± 255.41 mm3, P = 0.007) compared to controls. Biomarker profiling revealed elevated amyloid pathology in PD, with higher serum Aβ1-42 (median [IQR]: 1.98 [1.75–2.22] vs. 1.14 [1.10–1.19], P < 0.001) and α-synuclein (2.03 [1.85–2.22] vs. 1.06 [1.03–1.10], P < 0.001). Proinflammatory markers were markedly increased in PD, including CRP (9.30 [7.85–10.75] vs. 6.30 [5.60–7.10], P = 0.01), TNF-α (372.20 [329.85–414.55] vs. 184.50 [165.20–203.80], P < 0.001), and IL-1β (573.50 [497.15–649.85] vs. 115.40 [101.05–129.75], P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified cortical thinning, brainstem atrophy, and IL-1β elevation as independent predictors of sleep disturbances (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
These findings highlight the interplay between neuroanatomical changes, amyloid pathology, and systemic inflammation in PD-related sleep dysfunction, suggesting potential therapeutic targets.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), to date, is widespread. It is a neurodegenerative disease that impairs the quality of life of the affected, as it is a slowly but progressively evolving disease. This paper presents a smart glove for evaluating PD patients by monitoring hand tremors and evaluating specific exercises involved by the MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale), enabling disease evolution assessment. The smart glove consists of a TPU flexible support, integrating two flexible MEMS piezoelectric sensors based on Aluminum Nitride and an inertial sensor to detect finger and arm movements. The smart glove integrates an electronic conditioning section for piezoelectric signals to make them suitable for the following acquisition by a microcontroller section based on nRF52840 SoC, which jointly processes the piezoelectric and inertial signals related to standard patient's hand and arm exercises (i.e., finger tapping, fist opening/closing of the hand, resting hand tremor), assigning them scores according to the MDS-UPDRS. Three embedded Machine Learning (ML) algorithms based on Neural Networks (NN) were deployed to classify piezoelectric and inertial signals. Seven individuals, six of them with diagnosed PD, were involved in developing ML models. Datasets were gathered to train and test the ML algorithms, constituted by signal samples related to three tests involved in the UPDRS scale according to PD severity. The tests demonstrated the proper operation of the proposed smart glove in tracking the movement changes induced by PD; also, the developed embedded ML algorithms showed performance in classifying hand/arm movements, reaching 95.12 %, 98.39 %, and 96.62 % for finger-tapping, hand-fist closure, and resting tremor, respectively.

Abstract: Background
The core clinical sign of Parkinson's disease (PD) is bradykinesia, for which a standard test is finger tapping: the clinician observes a person repetitively tap finger and thumb together. That requires an expert eye, a scarce resource, and even experts show variability and inaccuracy. Existing applications of technology to finger tapping reduce the tapping signal to one-dimensional measures, with researcher-defined features derived from those measures.
Objectives
(1) To apply a deep learning neural network directly to video of finger tapping, without human-defined measures/features, and determine classification accuracy for idiopathic PD versus controls. (2) To visualise the features learned by the model.
Methods
152 smartphone videos of 10s finger tapping were collected from 40 people with PD and 37 controls. We down-sampled pixel dimensions and videos were split into 1 s clips. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on these clips.
Results
For discriminating PD from controls, our model showed training accuracy 0.91, and test accuracy 0.69, with test precision 0.73, test recall 0.76 and test AUROC 0.76. We also report class activation maps for the five most predictive features. These show the spatial and temporal sections of video upon which the network focuses attention to make a prediction, including an apparent dropping thumb movement distinct for the PD group.
Conclusions
A deep learning neural network can be applied directly to standard video of finger tapping, to distinguish PD from controls, without a requirement to extract a one-dimensional signal from the video, or pre-define tapping features.

Abstract: Carveol (CR), a natural monocyclic monoterpenoid alcohol with various biological activities. In this investigation, we aimed to scrutinize the neuromodulatory and neuroprotective impact of CR on neuronal damage associated with rotenone (Rt)-mediated-Parkinson's disease (PD) murine model. Rats were placed into six groups: control, PD model [received Rt (2 mg/kg)], CR (20 mg/kg), Rt + CR1 (10 mg/kg), Rt + CR2 (20 mg/kg), and Rt + sinemet treatment (12 mg/kg). CR administration improved the motor function and modulated the disrupted neurotransmitters system, as demonstrated by the enhancement of dopamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholinesterase activity. The neuromodulatory efficiency of CR was extended to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tyrosine hydroxylase activity, while inhibited the accumulation of α-synuclein in the striatum. Notably, CR administration upregulated the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 antioxidant signaling, boosted glutathione, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities, while decreased malondialdehyde and nitric oxide in the striatum. Interestingly, CR exhibited persuasive anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting receptor for advanced glycation endproducts/nuclear factor kappa-B signaling and astrocytes activation, as demonstrated by declined glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and interleukin-6 levels. Furthermore, CR treatment attenuated neuronal loss by regulating B-cell lymphoma 2 protein/caspase-3 apoptotic signaling. Histopathological examination of striatum and substantia nigra validated the abovementioned results. Collectively, CR treatment revealed multi-target therapeutic agent for PD through the modulation of neuroinflammation, oxidative damage, neurotransmission, and cell survival signaling.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive disorder worldwide and its etiology remains unidentified. Over the last few decades, animal models of PD have been extensively utilized to explore the development and mechanisms of this neurodegenerative condition. Toxic and transgenic animal models for PD possess unique characteristics and constraints, necessitating careful consideration when selecting the appropriate model for research purposes. Animal models have played a significant role in uncovering the causes and development of PD, including its cellular and molecular processes. These models suggest that the disorder arises from intricate interplays between genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Every model possesses its unique set of strengths and weaknesses. This review provides a critical examination of animal models for PD and compares them with the features observed in the human manifestation of the disease.

Abstract: Deletion or mutation of RAB39B gene causes RAB39B deficiency in male patients and resulting X-linked Parkinson's disease (PD). Male Rab39b knockout (Rab39b-/Y) mouse, which simulates PD RAB39B genetic mutation-induced absence of functional RAB39B, was prepared to study pathomechanisms of RAB39B deficiency-evoked neurodegeneration of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic cells. Rab39b-/Y mice manifested PD motor impairment, degeneration of SN dopaminergic neurons and presence of SN Lewy bodies. Rab39b insufficiency caused macroautophagy impairment via reducing Atg3, Atg5, Atg7, Atg12 and Atg16L1 in SN. Rab39b deficiency-induced macroautophagy impairment upregulated α-synuclein within SN dopaminergic neurons and α-synuclein oligomers in SN. Macroautophagy activator rapamycin reversed macroautophagy dysfunction or upregulation of SN α-synuclein and ameliorated motor deficits and demise of SN dopaminergic neurons in Rab39b-/Y mice. Rab39b paucity-promoted upregulation of ER α-synuclein activated ER stress-triggered apoptotic signaling in SN. Rab39b insufficiency increased SN mitochondrial α-synuclein and produced mitochondrial defect and oxidative stress. Rab39b deficiency-induced ER stress apoptotic signaling, mitochondrial impairment and oxidative damage activated mitochondrial pro-apoptotic pathway in SN. Rab39b deficiency-induced upregulation of α-synuclein oligomers induced excitation of SN microglia and NLRP3 inflammasome and elevation of IL-1β, IL-18 or TNF-α. Rab39b paucity-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines activated MKK4-JNK -c-Jun/ATF-2 pro-apoptotic cascade and RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necroptotic pathway in SN. Our results suggest that RAB39B deficiency causes demise of SN dopaminergic neurons and X-linked PD by impairing macroautophagy and upregulating neurotoxic α-synuclein, which stimulates ER stress and mitochondrial apoptotic cascades and activates microglia and NLRP3 inflammasome. Our data also suggest that rapamycin possesses therapeutic effects on RAB39B mutation-induced X-linked PD.

Abstract: Purpose
Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between acoustic and cortical brain features in Parkinson's disease patients.
Methods
We recruited 19 (eight females, 11 males) Parkinson's disease patients and 19 (eight females, 11 males) healthy subjects to participate in the experiment. Speech samples of three vowels (/i/, /a/, /u/), six plosives (/p/, /pʰ/, /t/, /tʰ/, /k/, /kʰ/), and three voiced consonants (/l/, /m/, /n/) were collected for the experiment, and the acoustic parameters were extracted for fundamental frequency (F0), voice onset time (VOT), voicing onset-vocalic voicing onset (VO-VVO), first formant (F1), second formant (F2), third formant (F3), first bandwidth (B1), second bandwidth (B2), third bandwidth (B3), Jitter, Shimmer, and Harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). We also used Ingenia CX 3.0 T to complete the cranial magnetic resonance scanning and did image processing based on the Desikan-Killiany-Tourville Atlas. We assessed the differences in acoustic and neuroimaging parameters between the PD and healthy controls (HCs) groups using the Levene's test (LT), two-sample independent t test (TT), and Mann-Whitney U test (MWUT), and calculated Spearman's bias correlations for acoustic and neuroimaging parameters in the PD and HC groups, respectively.
Results
The results showed that in acoustic features, based on the results of the TT, it can be seen that the F3 of the PD group regarding the vowel /i/ is significantly smaller than that of the HC group. The jitter on the vowel /u/ was significantly higher in the male PD group than in the male HC group. For other acoustic measures, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. In the cortical features, the thickness, area, and volume of the cortex were reduced in the vast majority of the brains of the PD patients, however, there is also a small portion of the cortex that appears to be thickened. In the correlation analysis between cortical and acoustic features, F0, F1, F2, F3, B2, B3, VO-VVO, Jitter, HNR, and VOT acoustic parameters showed significant and strong correlation with thickness, area, and volume of cortical sites such as frontal, temporal, entorhinal, fusiform, and precuneus in PD patients, whereas no significant correlation was found in HC group.
Conclusions
This suggests that Parkinson's disease does have an effect on the acoustic and cortical features of the patient's brain, and that there is a correlation between the two features.

Abstract: Purpose
The ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is rich in dopaminergic neurons, may play a role in influencing clinical symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). However, the degeneration dynamics of the VTA during the early and prodromal stages of PD remain unclear. This study aims to explore microstructural changes in the VTA among prodromal PD patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and early-stage PD patients using free water imaging (FWI) to assess free water (FW) and its correlation with clinical symptoms.
Method
Diffusion tensor imaging data from 238 participants, including 69 healthy controls (HC), 54 iRBD patients, and 115 PD patients. FW values were computed using a bi-tensor model, and comparisons were done between the HC, iRBD, and PD groups. Additionally, the relationship between FW values in the VTA and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and clinical symptoms was explored through baseline assessments and longitudinal tracking of iRBD patients.
Results
FW values in the SNc significantly increased in iRBD and PD patients compared to HC, with the PD group exhibiting even higher FW values. Initially, the FW values in the VTA in iRBD patients did not significantly differ from those of HC but increased in early PD, correlating with anxiety and motor deficits. Longitudinal tracking revealed FW increases in the SNc and VTA in iRBD patients over time.
Conclusion
The present findings revealed a desynchronized degeneration pattern between the VTA and SNc, with no degeneration observed in the prodromal phase but gradual changes over time, leading to pronounced VTA degeneration in early PD. This underscores the impact of early VTA changes on PD symptoms, contributing to understanding of PD pathophysiology.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition that distresses brain cells and can severely impact a person's healthy life. Accurate diagnosis of PD is vital for early intervention. However, many existing works commonly use Voxel-Based Morphometry for brain analysis, which requires rigid preprocessing steps such as spatial normalization and template alignment that introduce biases and limit flexibility in segmenting complex or irregular brain structures. The study aims to improve PD prediction by addressing the limitation of the VBM technique by introducing the advanced automated segmentation method Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enable more accurate and reliable diagnosis. Additionally, the study presents a metaverse framework to provide a better understanding and decision-making in PD diagnosis. The proposed model employs advanced pre-processing procedures such as denoising, brain part separation, motion correction, and data augmentation to improve the brain 3D MRI image quality. The filtered images are then segmented using the SAM model. Features are extracted from segmented images using linear binary patterns, Gray-level co-occurrence motion, and shape features to enhance the robustness of PD classification. We use the Success History Intelligent Optimizer algorithm to hand-pick the optimal features for better diagnosis to avoid the local minima. The selected structures are classified with Inception-ResNet-v2 to fix the presence of PD. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance across various performance metrics for PD diagnosis. The proposed method accomplishes an accuracy of 99.75 % in predicting PD, highlighting its performance in accurately classifying PD and leading to improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Although Parkinson’s disease (PD) was first described in 1817, its etiology remains unclear. The primary neurotransmitter system affected in PD is the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, whose dysfunction leads to the hallmark motor symptoms of the disease. These motor symptoms typically emerge only after approximately 80 % of dopaminergic neurons are lost, complicating early detection and intervention. For this reason, it is important to know more about the stages prior to the appearance of symptoms that could represent the progression of the disease. Additionally, substantial evidence suggests sex differences in PD prevalence and progression, with men more frequently affected than women. However, most preclinical studies using animal models of PD have been conducted exclusively on males, limiting our understanding of neurochemical and behavioral differences between sexes, particularly under moderate dopaminergic lesions. To address this, we used the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD, inducing moderate lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to investigate sex-specific variations. Our study revealed distinct neurochemical and behavioral profiles in male and female animals, including sex-specific responses to amphetamine and apomorphine challenges. These pharmacological tests highlighted contrasting patterns in asymmetric and symmetric behaviors between sexes. Moreover, we considered individual variability often overlooked in animal models, which could provide critical insights into resilience or susceptibility to dopaminergic loss. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating sex as a biological variable in PD research to better understand the disease’s underlying mechanisms and to improve strategies for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD), a degenerative neurological condition that impairs motor and nonmotor skills, requires early and precise diagnosis for treatment. Machine learning for PD evaluation has improved, but accurate predictions, particularly for early diagnosis and progression, remain challenging. This study aims to improve the prediction of total and motor unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) scores by employing optimized ensemble learning models using the UCI Parkinson’s telemonitoring dataset. Data preprocessing involves outlier removal, normalization, and three feature selection methods: all features, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), and variance inflation factor (VIF) to reduce multicollinearity. Model performance is improved using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and robust ReliefF (RRF) feature ranking algorithms. The bagged ensemble (BE) models are optimized using Bayesian and random search hyperparameter tuning, focusing on learning rate and the number of weak learners, and are validated using 10-fold cross-validation to find the optimum configuration. The final proposed models, Bayesian-optimized BE with RRF and VIF (VIF-BOBE-RRF) and random search-optimized BE with RRF and VIF (VIF-RSOBE-RRF), are benchmarked against leading models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), boosting ensemble, decision tree regression (DTR), and their optimized variants. For total UPDRS, VIF-BOBE-RRF achieves R2=0.97, RMSE = 0.0400, MAE = 0.0169, while VIF-RSOBE-RRF records R2=0.97, RMSE = 0.0462, MAE = 0.0170. For motor UPDRS, VIF-BOBE-RRF attains R2=0.96, RMSE = 0.0454, MAE = 0.0190, while VIF-RSOBE-RRF achieves R2=0.96, RMSE = 0.0468, MAE = 0.0171. Shapley additive explanations analysis was employed to improve interpretability and identify clinically relevant predictors such as age, DFA, and test duration. Although enhancements over baseline models are constrained, the uniformity across datasets and increased model interpretability underscore the promise of these techniques as the preliminary instruments for PD monitoring. Further evaluation in real clinical environments is advised to evaluate their practical efficacy.

Abstract: Background
Accurate prediction of falls in patients with Parkinson's disease (PWP) is crucial for effective prevention efforts. Historically, fall risk models have heavily relied on motor features, overlooking the vital cognitive-motor interplay essential for locomotion.
Methods
Baseline assessments and year-long fall data from the CYClical Lower Extremity Exercise for Parkinson's disease II (CYCLE-II) trial's control group were utilized. A LASSO logistic regression model assessed thirty-seven demographic, motor, and cognitive variables to identify key fall predictors. To explore the practical implementation of predicting falls in a clinical setting, a second model was developed using a subset of nine candidate measures conducive for retrieval from electronic medical records. Models' accuracy was validated against Paul et al.'s 3-step fall prediction model.
Results
Analysis included 123 participants (mean age 65.3 ± 8.3 years, 66 % males, mean disease duration 4.9 ± 4.1 years). Seventy-two participants (58.5 %) fell at least once; with 33.1 % occurring during walking, 34.4 % resulting in injuries. The initial model identified 8 predictors with an AUC of 0.68. The second model, incorporating disease duration and cognitive tests, achieved an AUC of 0.67, comparable to Paul et al.'s validation (AUC 0.66). Participants with poorer information processing and spatial memory were more prone to falling over the 12-month period.
Conclusions
Impaired cognitive performance and longer disease duration were powerful predictors in identifying a future fall in PWP. The link between cognitive performance and potential for falling reinforces the strong interplay between gait and cognition.

Abstract: Early Onset Parkinsonism (EOP) refers to parkinsonism occurring before the age of 50 years. The causes are diverse and include secondary and genetic causes. Secondary causes related to medications, inflammatory and infective disorders are mostly treatable and well recognized as they usually present with a relatively more rapid clinical course compared to idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Genetic causes of EOP are more challenging to diagnose especially as more of the non-PARK genes are recognized to present with typical and atypical parkinsonism. Some of the genetic disorders such as Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) and Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) may present with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Additionally, some of the genetic disorders, including Wilson's disease and cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), are potentially treatable and should not be missed. Due to the advent of next generating sequencing techniques, genetic analyses facilitate early identification and proper treatment of diverse causes of EOP. In this review, we outline the clinical approach of EOP highlighting the key clinical features of some of the non-PARK genetic causes of EOP and related investigations, which could assist in clinical diagnosis. This review also encompass genetic diagnostic approaches, emphasizing the significance of pretest counseling and the principles of bioinformatics analysis strategies.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, causing motor symptoms like tremors and stiffness. Although current treatments like medication and deep brain stimulation can alleviate symptoms, they don't address the root cause of neuron loss. Therefore, cell replacement therapy emerges as a promising treatment strategy. However, the generation of engraftable dopaminergic (DA) cells in clinically relevant quantities is still a challenge. Recent advances in cell reprogramming technologies open up vast possibilities to produce patient-specific cells of a desired type in therapeutic quantities. The main cell reprogramming strategies involve the enforced expression of individual or sets of genes through viral transduction or transfection, or through small molecules, known as the chemical approach, which is a much easier and safer method. In our previous studies, using a small molecule approach (combinations of epigenetic modifiers and SMAD inhibitors such asDorsomorphin and SB431542), we have been able to generate DA progenitors from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The aim of this study was to further improve the method for the generation of DA progenitors and to test their therapeutic effect in an animal model of Parkinson's. The results showed that the addition of an autophagy enhancer (AE) to our DA cell induction protocol further increased the yield of DA progenitor cells. The results also showed that DA progenitors transplanted into the mouse model of PD survived, integrated, and improved PD motor symptoms. These data suggest that chemically-produced DA cells can be very promising and safe cellular therapeutics for PD.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a widespread neurodegenerative condition [1]; however, its association with glycolysis, specifically the activity of genes related to glycolysis, has not yet been explored. We downloaded 3 datasets related to PD from the GEO database and identified the glycolytic genes related to PD. Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were conducted. We constructed a PD diagnosis model using the SVM algorithm for differentially expressed glycolysis-related genes and verified the model with LASSO regression analysis. Next, we constructed a regulatory network of genes that were differentially expressed with respect to glycolysis. Finally, the amount of immune cell infiltration was analyzed in PD samples, and the correlation between differential genes and immune cells was calculated. A total of 64 differentially expressed glycolytic genes associated with PD were screened. Then, a GO analysis was conducted, followed by KEGG and GASE enrichment analyses. Within the established PD diagnostic model, 26 genes that were differentially expressed and linked to glycolysis showed strong statistical significance. After further screening, a diagnostic model for PD including seven key genes was established. Further analysis showed that ABHD5 most strongly correlated with neutrophils (r = 0.507). The key gene SMAD3 was strongly negatively associated with gamma delta T cells (r = −0.488). This research offered a theoretical foundation for the association between glycolysis and PD. Seven glycolytic genes were identified as significantly linked to PD and warrant additional research.

Abstract: Objective
Identifying intrinsic pattern of Parkinson’s disease (PD) helps to better understand of PD and provide insights to disease identification and treatment monitoring. Here we confirmed the PD-related covariance pattern (PDRP) by using arterial spin labelling technology (ASL-PDRP) and explore its potential for predicting motor progression and levodopa (L-DOPA) reactivity reduction.
Methods
Data from an original cohort of 179 PD and 62 normal controls (NC) and a validation cohort including 36 PD and 19 NC to construct and validate the ASL-PDRP. The correlations between the pattern and motor symptoms were analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally (71 PD owned longitudinal data) with hierarchical linear regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted in 54 L-DOPA-managed PD patients to predict the levodopa reactivity reduction.
Results
The first principal component was predominantly recognized as the ASL-PDRP, with its expression being higher in PD than NC in both sets (original: P = 0.017, AUC = 0.598; validation: P = 0.024, AUC = 0.661). The pattern expression was associated with UPDRS III (P = 0.006) and sub-symptoms (axial: P < 0.001; rigidity: P = 0.003; bradykinesia: P = 0.015) at baseline. The ASL-PDRP could predict the progression of UPDRS III (P = 0.021, β = 4.930). Higher expression of the pattern had slower rate of levodopa reactivity reduction in PD patients with axial symptom (P = 0.031).
Conclusion
The identified ASL-PDRP may have potential for characterizing PD with the ability to predict motor progression and L-DOPA reactivity reduction.

Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity, and impaired balance due to the degeneration of neurons. This paper proposes an Early Parkinson’s disease Diagnosis using Transition Propagation Graph Neutral Network with Dynamic Hunting Leadership Optimization algorithm using voice features/attributes (EPDD-TPGNN-DHLO) approach. First, the pre-processed voice data are analyzed using Synchrosqueezing Fractional Wavelet Transform (SFWT) to extract hand crafted features. Then, Dynamic Hunting Leadership Optimization (DHLO) algorithm is employed to feature selection for identifying the most relevant features. The Zebra Optimization Algorithm is employed to enhance the classification accuracy and optimize the weight parameters of Transition Propagation Graph Neural Networks (TPGNN). The proposed EPDD-TPGNN-DHLO method achieves 24.68% to 26.22% higher accuracy, 26.18% to 29.18% greater specificity, and 24.48% to 28.49% improved precision compared to the existing DPD-CNN-LSTM, PP-PD-ANN and EPDI-TSVS-ML models. Finally, the EPDD-TPGNN-DHLO approach demonstrates a significant improvement over the existing techniques.

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Given the increasing age of the general population, PD has emerged as a significant public health and societal concern, impacting both individual well-being and socioeconomic progress. The present interventions have proven insufficient in impeding the progressive nature of PD. Consequently, it is imperative to promptly identify efficacious strategies for the prevention and treatment of PD. Icaritin (ICT) is a flavonoid extracted from Epimedium Brevicornu Maxim that is a phytoestrogen with antitumour, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiaging, and neuroprotective properties. This paper reviews the protective effect of ICT on dopaminergic neurons through anti-oxidative stress, improving mitochondrial function, inhibiting neuroinflammatory responses, reducing Lewy body formation, and decreasing apoptosis. The primary objective of this article is to provide valuable insights and serve as a reference for the potential use of ICT in the prevention and treatment of PD.

Abstract: In this study, a novel application of intelligent machine predictive exogenous neuro-structure optimized with the Levenberg-Marquardt (IMPENS-LM) algorithm is presented to analyze the dynamics of fractional innate immune response to nonlinear Parkinson's disease propagation considering the impact of therapeutic interventions (PDP-TI). A novel design of the fractional PDP-TI model is constructed with a nonlinear system of five differential compartments representing healthy neurons and infected neurons, extracellular α-syn, and both active and resting microglia. The presented IMPENS is formulated with neuro-structure of nonlinear autoregressive exogenous neural networks with efficient backpropagation of LM algorithm to solve the scenarios of nonlinear fractional PDP-TI model by varying neuron infection rate, survival percentage of α-syn from the death of infected neurons, the density of microglia, infected neurons death rate due to α-syn aggregations, and the ratio of therapeutic approach targeting α-syn with fixed values of annihilation rate of activated microglia, apoptosis rate of neurons and microglia etc. The IMPENS-LM algorithm is operated on synthetic datasets of fractional PDP-TI system generated through the Grunwald-Letnikov fractional finite difference-based numerical computing paradigm for each variant. The sufficient large numerical experimentation is performed with the IMPENS-LM technique to analyze the behavior of the dynamics of the PDP-TI model with the help of different proximity, complexity, and statistical measures in terms of MSE-based iterative fitness learning arcs, absolute error analysis, error autocorrelation plots, and error histograms, to substantiate the efficacy of stochastic solver on sundry fractional orders.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder in the world, with prevalence expected to exceed 12 million by 2040, which poses significant health care and societal challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems and wearable sensors hold potential for PD diagnosis, personalized symptom monitoring, and progression prediction. Nonetheless, ethical AI adoption requires several core principles, including user trust, transparency, fairness, and human oversight.
Objective
This study aims to explore and synthesize the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, such as individuals living with PD, health care professionals, AI experts, and bioethicists. The aim was to guide the development of AI-driven digital health solutions, emphasizing transparency, data security, fairness, and bias mitigation while ensuring robust human oversight. These efforts are part of the broader Artificial Intelligence-Based Parkinson’s Disease Risk Assessment and Prognosis (AI-PROGNOSIS) European project, dedicated to advancing ethical and effective AI applications in PD diagnosis and management.
Methods
An exploratory qualitative approach, based on 2 datasets constructed from cocreation workshops, engaged key stakeholders with diverse expertise to gather insights, ensuring a broad range of perspectives and enriching the thematic analysis. A total of 24 participants participated in the cocreation workshops, including 11 (46%) people with PD, 6 (25%) health care professionals, 3 (13%) AI technical experts, 1 (4%) bioethics expert, and 3 (13%) facilitators. Using a semistructured guide, key aspects of the discussion centered on trust, fairness, explainability, autonomy, and the psychological impact of AI in PD care.
Results
Thematic analysis of the cocreation workshop transcripts identified 5 key main themes, each explored through various corresponding subthemes. AI trust and security (theme 1) was highlighted, focusing on data safety and the accuracy and reliability of the AI systems. AI transparency and education (theme 2) emphasized the need for educational initiatives and the importance of transparency and explainability of AI technologies. AI bias (theme 3) was identified as a critical theme, addressing issues of bias and fairness and ensuring equitable access to AI-driven health care solutions. Human oversight (theme 4) stressed the significance of AI-human collaboration and the essential role of human review in AI processes. Finally, AI’s psychological impact (theme 5) examined the emotional impact of AI on patients and how AI is perceived in the context of PD care.
Conclusions
Our findings underline the importance of implementing robust security measures, developing transparent and explainable AI models, reinforcing bias mitigation and reduction strategies and equitable access to treatment, integrating human oversight, and considering the psychological impact of AI-assisted health care. These insights provide actionable guidance for developing trustworthy and effective AI-driven digital PD diagnosis and management solutions.

Abstract: Background
Neurological disorders, particularly Parkinson's Disease (PD), are serious and progressive conditions that significantly impact patients' motor functions and overall quality of life. Accurate and timely diagnosis is still crucial, but it is quite challenging. Understanding the changes in the brain linked to PD requires using neuroimaging modalities like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL) methods, can potentially improve the precision of diagnosis.
Method
In the current study, we present a novel approach that integrates T1-weighted structural MRI and rest-state functional MRI using multi-site-cum-multi-modality neuroimaging data. To maximize the richness of the data, our approach integrates deep feature-level fusion across these modalities. We proposed a custom multi-scale 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that captures features at different spatial scales, enhancing the model's capacity to learn PD-related complex patterns.
Results
With an accuracy of 97.12 %, sensitivity of 97.26 %, F1-Score of 97.63 %, Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.99, mean average precision (mAP) of 99.53 %, and Dice Coefficient of 0.97, the proposed Neuro_DeFused-Net diagnostic model performs exceptionally well. These results highlight the model's robust ability to distinguish PD patients from Controls (Normal), even across a variety of datasets and neuroimaging modalities.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate the transformational ability of AI-driven models to facilitate the early diagnosis of PD. The proposed Neuro_DeFused-Net model enables the rapid detection of health markers through fast analysis of complicated neuroimaging data. Thus, timely intervention and individualized treatment strategies lead to improved patient outcomes and quality of life.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by substantial clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The biological mechanisms underlying different clinical presentations remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate if distinct biological pathways, represented by pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS's), differ between PD clinical subtypes.
Methods
The study included 799 PD patients classified into four empirical PD motor subtypes: tremor-dominant (TD) (n = 345), akinetic-rigid (AR) (n = 227), gait-difficulty (n = 82) and mixed (n = 145). Genotyping was performed using the Illumina NeuroChip array, with data imputed via the TOPMed Imputation Server. A total of 7,918,344 variants were included in the final analysis. Ten PRS's were constructed, including overall PD risk, adaptive immunity, alpha-synuclein, innate immunity, lysosomal, endocytic membrane trafficking, mitochondrial, microglial, monocyte, and Alzheimer's disease pathways. Linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, disease duration, and genetic principal components were used to compare PRS's between PD subtypes.
Results
After correcting for multiple testing (P < 0.0125 considered significant), a significantly higher adaptive immunity PD PRS was observed for the AR subtype compared to other subtypes (β: 0.04, P = 0.011). Nominally significant (P < 0.05) associations included an increased overall PD PRS for the AR subtype (β: 0.18, P = 0.041) and a lower adaptive immunity PD PRS for the TD subtype (β: −0.03, P = 0.041).
Conclusion
Our findings suggest distinct genetic risk profiles across PD motor subtypes, particularly within immune-related pathways. These results support viewing PD as a syndrome driven by multiple distinct pathomechanisms, underscoring the need for subtype-specific biomarkers, more personalized clinical trial designs, and targeted therapeutic strategies in PD management.

Abstract: Background
Step initiation is a critical movement that combines motor and cognitive elements, notably in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who experience marked difficulties due to disrupted anticipatory postural adjustments (APA). This study investigated the involvement of the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) associated with step initiation that requires high cognitive processing (e.g., cognitive-motor conflicts) in individuals with PD compared to healthy controls.
Methods
We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess the cortical hemodynamic responses of 33 individuals with PD and 17 healthy controls as they performed step initiation in both congruent (all cues aligned) and incongruent (conflicting cues) conditions. The study sought to analyze variations in the hemodynamic responses related to these conditions, hypothesizing that PD individuals would exhibit reduced cortical activation in the SMA and DLPFC due to motor cortex inefficiencies affecting APA.
Results
Individuals with PD exhibited significant deficits in biomechanical performance (e.g., increased APA delays and errors) and altered hemodynamic responses in the SMA and DLPFC compared to controls, particularly under incongruent conditions. These observations indicate diminished cortical efficiency in PD during motor execution coupled with cognitive demands.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that PD involves impairments in cortical areas linked to movement planning and cognitive control. These findings suggest potential avenues for targeted rehabilitation strategies that enhance cognitive-motor integration, possibly improving mobility and reducing fall risk in PD.

Abstract: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is a well-established treatment for improving motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its effects on patients with cognitive impairment (CI) remain controversial due to the unique challenges and risks posed by cognitive decline. This study aimed to evaluate the mid- to long-term impact of STN-DBS on motor function, non-motor symptoms, and QOL in PD patients with CI. A retrospective cohort of 72 PD patients who underwent STN-DBS and 73 non-DBS patients was analyzed. Baseline and follow-up assessments (minimum one-year follow-up) included motor function (MDS-UPDRS III “off”), non-motor symptoms (NMSS), QOL (PDQ-8), and cognitive function (MMSE). Patients were stratified into a CI cohort based on education-adjusted MMSE cutoffs, with 30 patients in the STN-DBS group and 23 in the non-DBS group. Over two years, the STN-DBS group showed significant improvements in motor function, reduced medication burden (LEDD), and enhanced QOL. Notably, patients with CI in the STN-DBS group achieved better long-term motor and non-motor outcomes compared to the non-DBS group. These results highlight the potential of STN-DBS to offer sustained benefits for cognitively impaired PD patients, though further research is necessary to confirm its long-term safety and efficacy.

Abstract: Introduction
Essential oil (EO) of eucalyptus has been commonly used as a traditional Chinese medicine to treat illnesses such as influenza, dysentery and eczema, and it is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. However, its neuroprotective effects have not been fully demonstrated. Given the rising prevalence of the neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson's disease, in aging populations, this study aims to investigate the effect of Eucalyptus globulus EO (EuEO) in a rat Parkinson model induced by bilateral lesion with the neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA).
Methods
EuEO composition was determined by GC–MS. Wistar rats were treated with EuEO (25 mg/kg, i.p) for 36 days, and behavioral tests (Barnes maze, wire mesh ramp, and grip strength) were performed 18 days after 6-OHDA application. We evaluated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in the brain caudate-putamen unit; inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6) expression in the hippocampus; liver, kidney, and gut histology; serum parameters; and hepatic lipid content.
Results
Our findings indicate that EuEO is mainly composed of 1,8-cineole (81.8 %) and that, in the parkinsonian rats, it improved impairments in spatial memory, motor performance, and strength; increased TH and DAT protein content; decreased TNF-α expression; diminished liver lipid content and body weight gain without changes in the rats’ food/water consumption or their serum lipid levels; diminished transaminase and alkaline phosphatase activity, and the albumin/globulin ratio.
Discussion
Although 1,8-cineole is a well-documented bioactive compound, further research is required to evaluate its potential synergistic or additive interactions with minor components. Our findings highlight the remarkable neuroprotective potential of EuEO and encourage further research of this very promising therapeutic alternative.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder，which presents significant therapeutic hurdles due to poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and premature metabolic clearance of pharmacological agents. Herein, we constructed a microRNA (miR)-188-3p loaded neutrophil-biomimetic nanovesicle (designated as Neutro/miR-188-3p) for the treatment of PD, with a core module composed of miR-188-3p condensed by protamine and an outer module consisting of a lipid layer hybridized with neutrophil membrane. The neutrophil membrane endowed the biomimetic nanovesicles with long circulation properties and targeted migration capabilities. The biomimetic nanovesicles could regulated cell division protein kinase 5 (CDK5) and nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) to inhibit autophagy and pyroptosis in dopamine neurons, which enhanced the treatment of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced cell models and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice models. Furthermore, the Neutro/miR-188-3p exhibited tunable preparation, batch-to-batch consistency, and storage stability. Therefore, the Neutro/miR-188-3p hold great promise as an effective drug delivery system for PD treatment, with significant potential for clinical translation.

Abstract: Freezing of gait (FoG) stands as one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD), occurring in more than half of patients with advanced PD. This condition manifests as a sudden blockage, significantly reducing the patients’ quality of life. To improve gait and ameliorate FoG, cueing strategies involving audio, visual, or tactile stimulation have been evaluated. In particular, on-demand systems that can automatically detect FoG and administer cueing have emerged as promising solutions. In response, several wearable sensors and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed for accurate FoG recognition. However, existing techniques suffer from several critical challenges, notably suboptimal performance, and limitations for real-time operation and edge deployment. Addressing these issues, this study presents a groundbreaking advancement in real-time edge-based FoG recognition utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN). We designed an optimized model, rigorously evaluating it across 62 PD patients using a cutting-edge reference dataset, achieving an F1-score of 92% and an area under the curve of 0.97. Further testing on an external dataset resulted in consistent detection performance, while a lower specificity was observed. The CNN implementation on a cost-effective processing device resulted in a 1 ms inference time and required only 6.3 KB of random access memory (RAM) and 37.8 Kb of Flash memory, meeting real-time demands and enhancing clinical applicability.

Abstract: Introduction
Determining Parkinson’s disease (PD) stage and severity are among the factors affecting treatment strategy. Dopamine transporter scan (DaTSCAN) has high efficiency in the diagnosis of PD, while its role in predicting motor function, dyskinesia, and symptoms severity trajectory remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between motor symptoms patterns in PD with DaTscan findings.
Methods
A total of 196 patients were included and grouped based on tremor score, postural instability and gait difficulty score, and the presentation of dyskinesia. Multivariate and ordinal logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between two-year follow-up of the PD patients’ motor symptoms assessment scores and DaTSCAN finding patterns.
Results
Patients with dyskinesia exhibited significantly lower DaTSCAN uptake across all measured regions, with the most pronounced reductions observed in the right caudate and left putamen (p < 0.001). Additionally, DaTSCAN values were strongly associated with overall disease severity (p < 0.001). A notable positive correlation was found between DaTSCAN uptake and Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores, whereas significant negative correlations were observed between DaTSCAN measures (including the caudate, putamen, and anterior putamen) and clinical motor scores, such as MDS-UPDRS III, MDS-UPDRS II, and PIGD. In contrast, DaTSCAN parameters did not significantly predict tremor-dominant (TD) scores.
Conclusion
Beyond its diagnostic utility, DaTSCAN provides meaningful insights into disease severity and motor dysfunction in PD, with particular relevance to postural instability and gait disturbance.

Abstract: Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by early synaptic and axonal dysfunction, driven by α-synuclein (α-Syn, encoded by the SNCA gene) aggregation. The axon guidance molecules play critical roles in neuronal integrity, yet their dysregulation in PD remains underexplored.
Objectives
This study aimed to demonstrate how α-Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) alter the expression of axon guidance molecules, contributing to early synucleinopathy, and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of netrin-1 (NTN1).
Methods
Transgenic hSNCANestin mice and PFF-injected models were used. Behavioral assessments, Western blot analyses, and immunofluorescence quantified the expression of axon guidance molecules and neuronal morphology at multiple time points.
Results
In hSNCANestin mice, NTN1 mRNA and protein levels decreased significantly at 8 months, while deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) increased, correlating with reduced dendritic length, spine density, and synaptic proteins. PFF-injected mice showed similar NTN1 reduction and DCC elevation at 6 months, alongside motor deficits and tyrosine hydroxylase–positive (TH+) neuron loss. Exogenous NTN1 application reversed morphological deficits in SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons exposed to α-Syn PFFs, highlighting its protective role.
Conclusion
α-Syn-induced NTN1 reduction exacerbates early PD pathology by impairing axonal and synaptic integrity, while NTN1 restoration mitigates these effects, suggesting therapeutic potential. These findings emphasize axon guidance pathways as key contributors to PD pathogenesis and targets for disease-modifying strategies.

Abstract: In this review, we have discussed the invasive and non-invasive treatment options for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) following their safety, specificity, and reliability. Initially, this study has highlighted the invasive treatment options and the side effects they possess. A deep understanding of L-Dopa treatment, as oral or infusion, and the use of dopamine agonists has indicated that there is a need to acquire an alternative treatment for PD. The combined therapy with L-Dopa has been proven to affect PD, but with some limitations, such as mild to chronic side effects, with particular requirements of age and health of the patient and a large amount of expenditure. In the discussion of noninvasive methods to treat PD, we have found that this approach is comparatively slow and requires repetitive sessions, but is safe, effective, and reliable at any stage of PD. Electroconvulsive therapy has revealed its effectiveness in various neurological diseases, including PD. Transcranial current stimulation (direct or alternative) has already been shown to have an alleviative response to PD symptoms. Transcranial magnetic stimulations and other strategies of using the magnetic field for potential treatment options for PD need to be explored further imminently.

Abstract: Background
Foslevodopa/foscarbidopa (LDp/CDp) are soluble prodrugs of levodopa/carbidopa delivered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) via a portable pump to provide continuous levodopa exposures.
Objective
To assess the safety of LDp/CDp and the relative bioavailability of levodopa/carbidopa following LDp/CDp 24-hour CSCI administration to the arm, thigh, and flank versus the abdomen.
Methods
Two open-label, randomized crossover studies (healthy adult volunteers [HV]; adults with advanced Parkinson’s disease [aPD]; NCT05094050) evaluated 24-hr CSCI of LDp/CDp to different infusion sites (abdomen, arm, thigh, flank), each designated as a study regimen. Participants in the aPD study had levodopa-responsive idiopathic Parkinson’s disease with ≥2.5 h of “Off” time/day. In the HV study, each LDp/CDp regimen was administered over 24 h, with 72-hour washout periods between regimens. In the aPD study, LDp/CDp was administered for 2 consecutive days at each infusion site, with no washout between regimens.
Results
For both levodopa and carbidopa, the 90% confidence intervals for both exposure measures (AUC and Cmax) were within the 80–125% range for the comparison between the abdomen and each alternate infusion site, meeting the criteria for bioequivalence. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild infusion site reactions, which occurred in 3/12 participants (HV study) and 9/16 participants (aPD study). There were no serious TEAEs and no event led to early discontinuation in either study.
Conclusions
The pharmacokinetics of levodopa and carbidopa demonstrated that the abdomen, arm, thigh, and flank are interchangeable sites for CSCI of LDp/CDp. There were no concerning patterns of adverse events.

Abstract: Background
Increasing evidence has documented cortical involvement at all stages of PD. The local vulnerabilities within certain brain regions in PD have been previously demonstrated, whereas its underlying genetic and neurochemical factors remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the spatial spectrum of cortical atrophy in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and link these variances in gray matter properties and curvature respectively to putative molecular pathways and neurotransmitter factors.
Methods
We recruited 141 clinically diagnosed PD patients and 70 healthy controls. Cortical morphological abnormalities of PD were obtained by intergroup comparisons in gray matter properties metrics and curvature measurements. Then we performed gene-category enrichment and spatial correlation analyses to evaluate the specific correspondence between cortical alteration in PD and genetic expression from the Allen Human Brain Atlas and normative neurotransmitter atlases from Neuromaps.
Results
We found decreased gray matter properties in temporal, somatomotor, cingulate and occipital cortices, decreased curvature measures in occipital, temporal and orbitofrontal cortices, and increased curvature measures in somatomotor, prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices for PD patients. The related genes were enriched for the glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, and post-translational histone modifications processes. In addition, the serotonin and norepinephrine transporter devoted more to gray matter properties alterations while the dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, and norepinephrine transporter were strong contributors of curvature abnormalities in PD.
Conclusions
Collectively, the present study offered interpretation of cortical morphological alterations and the cortical pathogenic theory in PD from genetic and neurochemical perspectives, which inspire further research on new pharmacotherapeutic approaches.

Abstract: Background
Dance for Parkinson’s Disease (DfPD) is a dance program for individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). There is a lack of knowledge about the effect of this program on frailty and sarcopenia experienced by patients with PD. In addition, no randomized controlled trial to date has investigated either the possible differential effects of in-person versus online DfPD or the possible effects of DfPD on clinical parameters in Greek patients with PD.
Objective
We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of a culturally tailored and patient-centered DfPD program offered both in-person and online to Greek patients with early- to midstage PD.
Methods
This is a 3-arm crossover randomized controlled trial (in-person DfPD vs online DfPD vs control) of UPGRADE-PD (Upbeating Greek Application of Dance in Parkinson’s Disease). The experimental period will be 10 months, including three 2-month interventional periods of two 60-minute dance classes per week for each group (in-person DfPD vs online DfPD) versus a control group (nonintervention group), and two 2-month washout periods between each group for 40 Greek patients with early- to midstage PD. Assessments will be performed face-to-face at baseline and at the end of each study period and will include quality of life, fatigue, depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, sarcopenia, frailty, balance, cognitive functions, movement and nonmovement PD symptoms, and BMI. Safety, feasibility, and patient satisfaction for each dance intervention (in-person DfPD vs online DfPD) will be assessed as well.
Results
The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Eginition University Hospital in September 2022 and the Research and Ethics Committee of the University of West Attica in October 2023 and funded in September 2023. The first participant was enrolled in April 2023, and the trial is currently ongoing and will conclude in September 2024.
Conclusions
The results of this study are expected to show the possible differential effect of a patient-centered and culturally tailored in-person vs online DfPD intervention on several movement and nonmovement symptoms, as well as on quality of life, sarcopenia, and frailty in people living with PD in Greece.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by dopaminergic neuron loss and α-synuclein accumulation. In recent years, a growing body of work has explored the roles of endogenous gasotransmitters—namely nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)—in pathways relevant to PD pathology. Though traditionally viewed as toxic, these molecules may, under regulated conditions, influence oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function in ways that could be therapeutically significant. NO illustrates this complexity. At physiological concentrations, it supports synaptic function and cerebral blood flow. Yet, when overproduced, it promotes oxidative damage and disrupts mitochondrial processes. Therapeutic strategies include NOS enzyme inhibition and controlled-release NO donors. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems have also been proposed to fine-tune local NO availability, though their clinical relevance remains to be fully validated. CO, produced via heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), has shown cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. While promising in modulating redox signaling and apoptosis, any therapeutic use of CO requires careful dose regulation to avoid toxicity. H2S, whose levels appear diminished in PD models, has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and mitochondrial-supportive effects in preclinical studies. As with NO and CO, maintaining balanced levels of H2S is critical—both too little and too much can cause harm, making precise delivery essential. This review examines the involvement of NO, CO, and H2S in PD-related stress responses, emphasizing how their effects vary across experimental models and remain only partially understood.

Abstract: Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience both motor and non-motor symptoms. However, it remains unclear the full spectrum of PD, which requires a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor cortical regions. The use of combined transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) allows the examination of neural circuit beyond motor cortex. In this study, TMS-EEG data were collected over the primary motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in 46 patients with PD and 27 healthy controls (HC). We analyzed TMS-evoked potentials and oscillatory powers to identify differences in cortical excitability and neural connectivity dynamics between the two cohorts. Patients with PD exhibited higher P30 amplitude following M1 stimulation compared to HCs, and there was a positive correlation between P30 amplitude and the severity of motor symptoms. DLPFC stimulation revealed an increased global mean field amplitude area under the curve (GMFA-AUC) at P30 and P60 in the PD group compared to HCs. A significant correlation was also observed within the PD group between P30 and P60 with depression scores. In addition, PD showed a significant power reduction in the alpha and beta bands during stimulation and distinct patterns emerged for each stimulation site. These findings provide novel insights into cortical network abnormalities and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PD.

Abstract: Introduction
GBA1 variants are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Sequencing of GBA1 on a large scale represents a burdensome task with currently adopted diagnostic techniques, namely Sanger sequencing and conventional short read next generation sequencing (sr-NGS). The high degree of sequence homology between GBA1 and its pseudogene GBA1LP is the major driver behind this complexity, leading to false positive and false negative results. We designed, optimized and validated LONG-NEXT, a new NGS-based strategy to streamline large scale GBA1 sequencing.
Methods
LONG-NEXT relies on a specific long-range PCR, encompassing the whole GBA1 gene, in one fragment (6.5 kb), followed by short-read NGS and a tailored bioinformatic pipeline masking the GBA1LP sequence on the reference genome.
Results
This protocol was optimized and tested on selected cases suspected of diagnostic mistakes by conventional testing (n = 13) and then validated on consecutively collected PD patients already screened either by Sanger sequencing (n = 101) or conventional sr-NGS (n = 294). LONG-NEXT reanalysis of 13 patients disclosed: 3 false positive cases due to mismapping of pseudogene reads on GBA1, 4 false homozygotes due to PCR-related allele dropout events, and 6 false negative cases, due to misalignment of GBA1 reads against the pseudogene or PCR-related allele dropout events. The validation phase disclosed one additional false homozygote in the Sanger cohort, and one false negative result in the sr-NGS cohort.
Conclusion
LONG-NEXT is a reliable, fast, cost-effective alternative for GBA1 sequencing and may prove strategic in light of current genotype-based tailored therapies specifically targeting GBA1-PD patients.

Abstract: Neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) have, in recent times, seen a major boost to their understanding due to the use of deep learning (DL) in the analysis and diagnosis process. DL, in particular, has been effective in unearthing many complex and intricate concepts of the EEG signal. This research is an attempt to understand the impact of the state-of-the-art DL technology, the transformer, in the diagnosis of PD from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. The time-domain EEG signals are transformed into time-frequency domain using the Stockwell transform for better insights. This transformation produces an image dataset, which can now be analyzed intricately for time and frequency features. These images are then fed to three transformer models tailored specifically for PD detection based on the response of the model. The classical vision transformer (ViT), the compact convolution transformer (CCT), and the swin transformer are selected for the purpose. The hyperparameters of each of the models are tuned by evaluating the various performance parameters at every iteration to design the most efficient models. The performance of the models is compared to each other as well as to other recent research using similar technology. The publicly available San Diego dataset is used for the analysis, and the ViT displays a commendable accuracy of 94% with the loss closing in towards zero. The CCT also performs well with fewer computational requirements.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder of high global burden. Uncertainties regarding its exact etiology have been hindering the development of curative therapies. As microglia, the brain's immune cells, are suspected to contribute to neurodegeneration by instigating neuroinflammation, existing anti-inflammatory agents could potentially serve as disease-modifying treatments for PD. Here we evaluated the impact of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist and anti-inflammatory drug, on motor symptoms and neuropathology in an α-synuclein transgenic mouse model (Line 61) for early onset/genetic PD. Two -weeks -old male Line 61 mice and non-transgenic littermates received daily 10 ​mg/kg montelukast or vehicle orally for 10 weeks. Motor functions were assessed through behavioral tests. Brain tissue was analyzed via unbiased transcriptomics, biochemically, and histologically for various parameters, including microglial and inflammation mediators. Upon montelukast treatment, Line 61 mice significantly improved their beam walk performance compared to vehicle -treated mice. The striatum and cerebellum of the montelukast -treated group showed microglial changes toward a smaller but more ramified appearance. Transcriptomics analysis revealed SGK1, a serine/threonine kinase upstream of NFκB and known target in PD, as the most downregulated gene in the striatum of montelukast -treated animals. This downregulation correlated with reduced striatal protein levels of activated IκB kinase, suggesting a reduced NFκB pathway activity upon montelukast treatment. Thus, oral montelukast administration might be promising for the management of PD, with specific effects on motor coordination and balance.

Abstract: Ethnopharmacological relevance
Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma, a traditional Chinese medicine known for opening the orifices and transforming phlegm, is used in the treatment of brain disorders. It is listed as the top grade in the famous herbal monograph Shennong Materia Medica Classic. Traditional Chinese medicine believes that Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma has a good advantage in the treatment of nervous system diseases, and modern research has also found that the essential oil of Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma is the main component that plays a neuroprotective role and plays an important role in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Aim of the study
This study aims to explore the effects and mechanisms of essential oil of Acorus tatarinowii Rhizoma (EOAT) on LPS-induced BV2 cell damage and Rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) rat models.
Materials and methods
In this experiment, the components of EOAT were identified by GC-MS. LPS was used to induce the overactivation of BV2 microglia, and rotenone was injected subcutaneously to induce Parkinson's disease in rats. Then, the expression of inflammatory factors and IBA-1 in cell was evaluated, and the effects of EOAT treatment were assessed on motor function, inflammatory factors, neurotransmitters, TH, α-Syn, and pathways and inflammation-related mRNA in rats.
Results
GC-MS analysis obtained 24 components, among which β-Asarone and α-Asarone had the highest contents. In vitro experiments showed that after 2 h of EOAT intervention, the inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-6 in the supernatant of LPS-induced BV2 cells were significantly reduced. The IF results showed that after EOAT intervention, the expression of IBA-1 protein in BV2 cells was significantly reduced. In animal experiments, rotenone injection in model rats led to a decrease in motor function, while inhalation of EOAT improved the motor ability of Parkinson's rats. In addition, Madopar and EOAT inhalation increased the levels of BDNF and DA in brain tissue and reduced the levels of IL-Iβ, TNF-α, and IL-6. IHC, IF, and WB analyses showed that the expression of TH protein in brain tissue of the Madopar group and the EOAT group was significantly increased, and the expression level of α-syn was reduced. RT-qPCR results showed that compared with the Model group, the levels of TLR2, MyD88, NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, α-syn, and Bax in the substantia nigra and striatum of the Madopar group and the EOAT group were significantly down-regulated, and the levels of TH and Bcl-2 were significantly up-regulated.
Conclusion
These findings suggest that EOAT can prevent LPS from damaging BV2 cells and significantly improve the motor function of PD rats and lessen neuroinflammation. The anti-Parkinson's mechanism of EOAT is primarily dependent on the regulation of the TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. It has been reported that astrocytes play a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Here, we aimed to identify the heterogeneity of astrocytes and investigate genes associated with astrocyte differentiation trajectories in PD.
Methods
The single-cell transcriptomic profiles of PD samples were collected from the GEO database. We have identified subsets of astrocytes and analyzed their functions. The differentiation trajectory of astrocyte subtypes was explored using Monocle2. Inflammatory response scores were determined using AUCell. The levels of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein expressions in astrocytes were analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western Blot assay, respectively.
Results
We characterized seven cell types within the substantia nigra region of both PD and normal samples. Our analysis revealed that astrocytes comprised the second-highest proportion of cell types. Additionally, we identified three distinct subpopulations of astrocytes: Astro-C0, Astro-C1, and Astro-C2. Notably, Astro-C0 was associated with inflammatory signaling pathways. Trajectory analysis indicated that Astro-C0 occupies an intermediate stage of differentiation. The astrocyte-related gene CHI3L1 was found to be highly expressed in the Astro-C0 subpopulation. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of CHI3L1 mRNA and protein in LPS-induced astrocytes. Astrocytes exhibiting elevated CHI3L1 levels demonstrated interactions with microglia in PD patients. Lastly, we discovered that CHI3L1 was significantly overexpressed in PD patients and exhibited strong diagnostic potential for the disease.
Conclusion
This study clarified the heterogeneity of astrocytes in PD based on the single-cell transcriptomic profiles and found that CHI3L1 may be a diagnostic biomarker for PD.

Abstract: Purpose
This study investigates whether speech changes over time in patients with different motor subtypes of Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Methods
This longitudinal study included 60 individuals with PD, classified into tremor-dominant (n = 42) and non-tremor-dominant (n = 18) subtypes according to the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Participants were assessed at three points: baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Speech samples were collected from diadochokinesis (/pataka/) and 60-second monologue tasks. The analyzed acoustic variables included syllable number, duration, phonation time, articulation rate, average syllable duration (ASD), and pause ratio.
Results
There were no statistically significant differences between groups regarding age (p = 0.298), disease duration (p = 0.098), age at symptom onset (p = 0.879), HY (p = 0.895), and UPDRS (p = 0.224) at baseline. The tremor- and non-tremor-dominant subtypes did not show significant differences over time when analyzed separately in articulation time metrics. However, significant differences were observed between the subtypes in all variables of the diadochokinesia task, including the number of syllables (p < 0.001), phonation time (p < 0.001), articulation rate (p = 0.002), and ASD (p = 0.028). Regarding the trend analysis, for the monologue, the following were observed: dominant non-tremor [number of syllables (R2 = 0.978), phonation time (R2 = 0.860) and pause ratio (R2 = 0.766)] and tremor [number of syllables (R2 = 0.989) and phonation time (R2 = 0.974)]. For the diadochokinesis: dominant non-tremor [number of syllables (R2 = 0.934) and phonation time (R2 = 0.977)] and tremor [ASD (R2 = 0.787)]
Conclusion
Over three years, the speech revealed that individuals with tremor and non-tremor subtypes exhibited stable patterns over time. Distinct speech differences emerged between the two groups, and articulation time metrics proved to be an effective tool for distinguishing between subtypes.This task emerged as a relevant approach from which biomarkers can be derived.

A total of 114 PD patients and 54 healthy controls (HCs) underwent sleep questionnaires and MRI examinations as part of data collection from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative cohort. An automated pipeline was proposed for ALPS calculation to reduce biases from manually region delineation. ALPS indices were compared between PD and HCs, as well as between PD with and without sleep disorders. Correlation was assessed between ALPS index and clinical characteristics. Furthermore, a 2-year follow-up analysis was performed to explore longitudinal impact of sleep disorders on glymphatic function.
Results
PD patients showed significantly decreased ALPS indices compared with HCs (P = 0.038). PD patients with sleep disorders showed slightly but not significantly decreased ALPS index compared with those with normal sleep (P = 0.058). However, PD patients who transitioned from normal sleep to sleep disorders showed significantly decreased ALPS index at follow-up compared to baseline (P = 0.047). In contrast, patients who maintained normal sleep showed no significant difference in ALPS index between follow-up and baseline (P = 0.934). In addition, PD patients who transitioned from normal sleep to sleep disorders showed significantly increased ΔMDS-UPDRS Part I score (P = 0.004), ΔMDS-UPDRS total score (P = 0.040) and ΔSCOPA-AUT (P = 0.048) compared with PD who remained normal sleep.
Conclusion
Sleep disorders accelerate dysfunction of glymphatic system as indicated by ALPS index in PD patients, which may be associated with symptom progression in follow-up analysis. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to prevent sleep disorders in early PD.

Abstract: Background
Sleep disturbances are common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD), negatively affecting daily functioning, exacerbating motor symptoms, and contributing to cognitive impairment. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood. This study utilized resting-state and task-based functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore how sleep disturbances affect brain function in PD patients at the neural level.
Methods
Sixty PD patients were recruited, including 30 with sleep disturbances and 30 without. Resting-state fNIRS and clinical assessments were used to analyze spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity. We also examined the mediating role of brain activity in the relationship between sleep disturbances and motor symptoms. The verbal fluency test (VFT) was employed to investigate changes in brain mechanisms related to executive function in patients with sleep disturbances.
Results
Resting-state analysis revealed significantly increased fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in PD patients with sleep disturbances. fALFF values were negatively correlated with sleep quality and positively with motor symptom severity. Mediation analysis indicated that spontaneous neural activity in the mPFC partially mediated the relationship between sleep disturbances and motor symptoms. Task-based analysis showed reduced activation in the mPFC and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during the VFT in patients with sleep disturbances, indicating impaired executive function.
Conclusion
Sleep disturbances in PD could be associated with exacerbated motor symptoms and may impair executive function by affecting spontaneous and task-related neural activity in the mPFC. These findings highlight mPFC dysfunction as a potential biomarker for targeted therapies.

Abstract: Summary
Synaptic dysfunction is recognized as an early step in the pathophysiology of parkinsonism. Several genetic mutations affecting the integrity of synaptic proteins cause or increase the risk of developing disease. We have identified a candidate causative mutation in synaptic “SH3GL2 Interacting Protein 1” (SGIP1), linked to early-onset parkinsonism in a consanguineous Arab family. Additionally, affected siblings display intellectual, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunction. Metabolic network analysis of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans shows patterns very similar to those of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. We show that the identified SGIP1 mutation causes a loss of protein function, and analyses in newly created Drosophila models reveal movement defects, synaptic transmission dysfunction, and neurodegeneration, including dopaminergic synapse loss. Histology and correlative light and electron microscopy reveal the absence of synaptic multivesicular bodies and the accumulation of degradative organelles. This research delineates a putative form of recessive parkinsonism, converging on defective synaptic proteostasis and opening avenues for diagnosis, genetic counseling, and treatment.

Abstract: Background
Sarcopenia contributes significantly to falls, frailty, and functional decline. Falls result from multiple factors.
Objectives
To assess whether sarcopenia assessment tools can predict falls and recurrent falls in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s Disease (PD).
Methods
The authors conducted a cohort study from March 2021 to March 2023 at a Brazilian tertiary public hospital, including patients aged 50 or older with mild to moderate PD who could stand and walk independently. The authors utilized tests recommended by the revised European consensus on sarcopenia (2019): SARC-F, grip strength, Short Physical Performance Battery, and body composition via DEXA scan. SARC-F is a cost-effective tool for assessing sarcopenia risk, evaluating perceived physical limitations. Participants completed a standardized fall report and were monitored monthly for twelve months.
Results
Among 103 patients, 48 (46.6 %) experienced falls, and 23 (22.3 %) had recurrent falls, totaling 159 falls. Longer disease duration predicted both falls and recurrent falls over 12-months. A history of falls in the last six months and dysautonomia also predicted falls, while SARC-F scores and type-2 diabetes predicted recurrent falls. SARC-F accuracy ranged from 58.06 % at a score of 4 % to 78.64 % at 10, with a correlation to UPDRS Part III.
Conclusions
SARC-F, disease duration, and type-2 diabetes were independent predictors of recurrent falls. A history of falls, disease duration, and dysautonomia predicted falls. Confirmed sarcopenia did not predict falls or recurrent falls in this cohort.

Abstract: In China, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent central nervous system (CNS) degenerative illness affecting middle-aged and older persons. Movement disorders including resting tremor, bradykinesia, myotonia, postural instability, and gait instability are the predominant clinical symptoms. The two main types of PD are sporadic and familial, with sporadic PD being the more prevalent of the two. The environment, genetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, protein aggregation and misfolding, loss of trophic factors, cell death, and gut microbiota may all have a role in the etiology of PD. PD is inversely connected with other cancers and positively correlated with COVID-19, diabetes mellitus (DM), melanoma, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk. Delaying disease progression, managing motor and non-motor symptoms, and avoiding and controlling dysfunction in the middle and later phases of the disease are the key areas of research and development for its therapy. Presently, the development and progression of PD can be slowed down by using conventional pharmacology, natural items, and innovative technology. This article reviews the pathogenesis of PD, its correlations with other non-genetic diseases, and the research progress of drugs and technologies for alleviating PD.

Abstract: Introduction
Glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) mutations are a genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), though most carriers do not develop the disease. This study aimed to identify exposure factors linked to PD in GBA1 carriers and assess clinical features and the probability of prodromal PD in non-manifesting carriers.
Methods
Data from the Parkinson's Disease & Movement Disorders Multicenter Database and Collaborative Network in China was used, including 59 GBA1 non-manifesting carriers, 62 controls, and 107 GBA1-associated PD, of whom 81 were in the early stage. Exposure factors included pesticide/solvent exposure, smoking, alcohol, and tea consumption. Logistic regression assessed the association between exposure factors and PD. Clinical characteristics were evaluated using multiple scales, relevant markers were collected based on the Movement Disorders Society criteria. A naive Bayesian classifier method determined the probability of prodromal PD in GBA1 non-manifesting carriers and controls.
Results
After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, pesticide/solvent exposure was positively associated with PD in GBA1 carriers (OR 8.40; 95 % CI 2.50–28.20), while smoking was inversely associated with PD (OR 0.18; 95 % CI 0.05–0.62). Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, constipation, hyposmia, and cognitive deficits were more severe in early-stage GBA1-associated PD than in carriers and controls. Clinical symptoms and the probability of prodromal PD were similar between carriers and controls.
Conclusions
PD in GBA1 carriers is closely linked to exposure factors. Early-stage GBA1-associated PD shows significant prodromal symptoms, which are not evident in carriers. The probability of prodromal PD in carriers is similar to that in controls.

Abstract: Context
The progressive neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson’s disease (PD) features diverse symptom presentation that progresses at different speeds and demands effective disease classification with precise patient management. The traditional methods demonstrate insufficient ability to detect the complex spatial-temporal connections between various clinical data types which highlights the need for advanced computational approaches.
Objective
The proposed study pioneered a state-of-the-art Spatio-temporal fusion and prediction (STFP) algorithm model approach that utilizes Graph neural network (GNN) and Temporal convolutional network (TCN) for multi-task classification of PD covering three significant dimensions: disease stage, progression speed, symptom subtype classification.
Methods
By employing the fusing approach for structural medical resonance imaging (MRI) and dopamine transporter scan (DaTSCAN) along with clinical biomarker data to examine spatial and temporal relationships a fused feature representation was developed. PPMI dataset was employed for training and evaluation of the multi-task classification model with Cohen’s Kappa, cumulative link model (CLM), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), and Brier score prominent evaluation metrics for analyzing the robustness of the model.
Key Findings
A Cohen’s Kappa of 0.89, a CLM score of 0.91, and an AUC-PR of 0.94 have been recorded for early-stage classification, slow progression, and motor symptom classification respectively demonstrating the outperformance of the proposed model. The superiority of the model has been established with p-values (<0.05) for ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests.
Conclusion
The STFP-based model advances the modeling of PD progression by improving classification accuracy and diagnostic clarity. Subsequent research will investigate more data modalities and their practical application in healthcare.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in medical care by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, and streamlining administrative processes, ultimately improving patient outcomes and operational efficiency. Additionally, it aids in predictive analytics, helping to identify potential health issues before they become critical. This paper presents a novel fractional mathematical model for α-syn transport and aggregation in neurons leading to the onset of Parkinson's disease (α-syn-TAN-OPD). A Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (input) Neural Network optimized with Levenberg Marquardt Backpropagation technique (NARX-NN-LMBT) is expertly deployed on the fractional α-syn-TAN-OPD model. Fractional Adams-Bashforth-Moulton numerical scheme is deployed to generate three scenarios with five different fractional order cases each by varying α-syn synthesis rate, monomeric α-syn concentration decay, and misfolded α-syn production rate. These synthetic datasets are passed to the NARX-NN-LMBT to simulate, model, and anticipate the α-syn-TAN-OPD scenarios. The NARX-NN-LMBT technique is validated using mean squared error (MSE), root MSE, normalized MSE and mean absolute error performance evaluations. Graphical descriptions of regression indices, error-input cross correlation, error autocorrelation, error histograms further detail the prowess of the NARX-NN-LMBT technique for the accurate modeling of α-syn-TAN-OPD cases. A comparative analysis is drawn between the numerical scheme and the NARX-NN-LMBT with mean absolute error lying between the ranges of 10−7 to 10−8. NARX-NN-LMBT forecasting ability is assessed on single and multiple steps with the MSE lying in the range of 10−13 to 10−16.

Abstract: Anxiety and depression are common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) that significantly affect patients’ quality of life. In recent years, our understanding of PD has advanced through multifaceted studies on the pathological mechanisms associated with anxiety and depression in PD. These classic psychiatric symptoms involve complex pathophysiology, with both distinct features and connections to the mechanisms underlying the aetiology of PD. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression in PD blurs the boundaries between them. Therefore, a comprehensive summary of the pathogenic mechanisms associated with anxiety and depression will aid in better addressing the emergence of these classic psychiatric symptoms in PD. This article integrates neuroanatomical, neural projection, neurotransmitter, neuroinflammatory, brain-gut axis, neurotrophic, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and genetic perspectives to provide a comprehensive description of the core pathological alterations underlying anxiety and depression in PD, aiming to provide an up-to-date perspective and broader therapeutic prospects for PD patients suffering from anxiety or depression.

Abstract: High dielectric constant nanoparticles into polymer matrices have attracted much attention because this process can improve the nanofriction generator performance. However, the dispersion of the developed materials remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel high-performance nanofriction generator (FBT-TENG) based on composite nanoparticles of Amino-functionalized barium titanate and functionalized graphite oxide (FGO/ABTO) with Polyimide (PI) as substrate, which can be used as a sensor for intelligent monitoring systems. Specifically, we introduced amino groups on the surface of barium titanate to improve its dispersion in the PI solution, and the dual effect composite with functionalized graphite oxide improved the TENG performance of the PI film. Due to the FGO/ABTO synergy, the FBT-TENG can generate high output voltages, currents and power densities of 75 V, 13 µA and 4.6 W/m2, respectively, which is a 9 times increase in power density compared to the original PI film. FBT-TENG is capable of powering capacitors. In addition, the FBT-TENG can be used as a sensor to build an early Parkinson’s disease detection system, which provides a more convenient option for the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s patients and has the potential for a wide range of medical applications.

Abstract: A progressive neurodegenerative condition that adversely impacts motor skills, speech, and cognitive abilities is Parkinson’s disease (PD). Research has revealed that verbal impediments manifest in the early of PD, making them a potential diagnostic marker. This study introduces an innovative approach, leveraging Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize a fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) model, enhancing the detection of PD. BO-FKNN was validated on a speech datasets. To comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model, BO-FKNN was compared against five commonly used parameter optimization methods, including FKNN based on Particle Swarm Optimization, FKNN based on Genetic algorithm, FKNN based on Bat algorithm, FKNN based on Artificial Bee Colony algorithm, and FKNN based on Grid search. Moreover, to further boost the diagnostic accuracy, a hybrid feature selection method based on Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Information Gain (IG) was employed prior to the BO-FKNN method, consequently the PCCIG-BO-FKNN was proposed. The experimental outcomes highlight the superior performance of the proposed system, boasting an impressive classification accuracy of 98.47%.

Abstract: Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a heterogeneous disorder, suggesting the presence of distinct subtypes. Speech data, though easy to collect, remains underutilized in subtyping PD.
Methods
Cross-sectional study with PD patients recruited from the Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic of the Neurology Service at the University Hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil. We included participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD and excluded participants with other disorders that could affect speech. Clinical and sociodemographic data were collected alongside MDS-UPDRS Parts II and III motor assessments. Tremor and gait-posture scores were derived from specific MDS-UPDRS items, with additional data on Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) status and Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD). The tasks diadochokinesis (DDK) and monologue were recorded and acoustically analyzed using software. We compared our identified clusters using clinical data through an analysis of covariance adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration.
Results
Ninety individuals with PD were included, with 61.2 (± 9.4) years old, 13.6 (± 6.6) disease duration, and 47.6 (± 10) age at onset. We identified three speech groups with strong separation between them, comprising 49 (mild), 13 (moderate), and 29 (severe) patients. Tremor and postural-gait stability scores differed significantly across the three clusters, with cluster 3 exhibiting higher tremor (13.42 ± 10.66 vs. 7.09 ± 6.62, p = 0.020) and greater postural-gait instability (10.25 ± 6.69 vs. 5.46 ± 4.91, p = 0.009) than cluster 1. These differences weren’t explainable by distinct age, sex, or disease duration.
Conclusion
Our speech-based clustering algorithm effectively differentiated Parkinson’s disease subtypes in this sample, identifying distinct groups based on tremor and axial symptoms.

Abstract: Background
There is growing interest in targeting Parkinson's Disease (PD) at an earlier stage, especially before emergence of motor symptoms. Cognitive dysfunction is a non-motor symptom in PD, whereas the Japanese version of the National Adult Reading Test (JART) is a validated battery to estimate the premorbid intellectual quotient (IQ). Therefore, the results of JART and current cognitive assessment after onset of PD may reflect different background factors. The goal of the study was to compare factors correlated with estimated premorbid intellectual performance using JART and current cognitive function after onset of PD.
Methods
Current motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; UPDRS Part III) and cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA) were assessed in 48 patients with PD. Premorbid IQs (verbal IQ: VIQ, performance IQ: PIQ, and full scale IQ: FIQ) were estimated using JART. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for background factors (current age, years of education, UPDRS Part III, and levodopa equivalent dose of prescribed drugs (LED)) with MoCA scores and estimated IQs.
Results
Estimated VIQ (r = 0.451, p = 0.001), PIQ (r = 0.445, p = 0.002) and FIQ (r = 0.453, p = 0.001) were significantly correlated with years of education that was fixed until adolescence (i.e. 20 s). MoCA was significantly correlated with current age (r=−0.401, p = 0.005) and UPDRS part III (r=−0.374, p = 0.009), both of which continue to progress gradually after onset of PD. In multiple regression analyses, these correlations were significant and independent.
Conclusion
Premorbid and current intellectual performance reflect different background factors in patients with PD.
