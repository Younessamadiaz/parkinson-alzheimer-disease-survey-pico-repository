Gradually this disease results in memory loss, poor thinking capacity, and overall cognitive decline. Nevertheless, various traditional works recommend that the pathological variations present in the brain happen decades prior to the initial clinical signs appearing. The implementation of cost-effective and noninvasive approaches to identify AD is significant for its timely mitigation as well as prevention. Therefore, in this article, an advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided AD detection approach is designed using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which are helpful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD progression very effectively. The EEG signals required for the identification of AD are collected from benchmark sources and are applied as the input to the ShortTerm Fourier Transform (STFT) for spectrogram image conversion. The AD detection is done using the proposed Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network (A-GAN), which produces the most desirable detection outcomes by classifying the input STFT images. The classification results are compared with the baseline AD detection approaches to validate the performance of the designed technique using various measures. The developed model supports earlier detection and provides highly more effective treatment interventions.","","979-8-3315-0313-0","10.1109/ICDICI66477.2025.11135201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11135201","Alzheimer's Disease Detection;Artificial Intelligence;Electroencephalogram Signals;Short-term Fourier Transform;Attention-based Generative Adversarial Network","Pathology;Fourier transforms;Accuracy;Prevention and mitigation;Generative adversarial networks;Brain modeling;Reliability engineering;Electroencephalography;Alzheimer's disease;Spectrogram","","","","22","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the illness progresses, symptoms may include confusion, difficulty speaking, and difficulty doing daily tasks. Using MRI medical images, previous studies have considered the application of deep learning to Alzheimer's disease, but this study introduced a novel aspect by simultaneously evaluating AD-VGG16, AD-Resnet50, and AD-2DCNN. Synergistic evaluation of these models provides a unique perspective to improve diagnostic accuracy. We used various preprocessing techniques, including pixel normalization and data augmentation using a well-known Alzheimer's MRI dataset, such as the Alzheimer MRI Preprocessed Dataset from Kaggle, to evaluate the models' precision, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, and recall. Our analysis reveals distinct performance levels among the models. AD-VGG16, AD-Resnet50, and the 2D CNN were evaluated with resulting accuracies of 93.45%, 79.43%, and 98.28% on the test set, respectively.

On one hand, in order to acquire non-local receptive fields and avoid information loss, we define a new convolution operation by composing a traditional convolution function and approximate and detailed representations after single-scale wavelet decomposition of source images. On the other hand, multi-scale wavelet decomposition is introduced to obtain more comprehensive multi-scale feature information. Then, we fuse all these cross-scale features to improve the problem of inaccurate localization of singular points. Given the novel wavelet convolution unit, we further design a network based on it for fine-grained Alzheimer's disease classifications (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, Normal controls, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment). Up to now, only a few methods have studied one or several fine-grained classifications, and even fewer methods can achieve both fine-grained and multi-class classifications. We adopt the novel network and diffuse tensor images to achieve fine-grained classifications, which achieved state-of-the-art accuracy for all eight kinds of fine-grained classifications, up to 97.30%, 95.78%, 95.00%, 94.00%, 97.89%, 95.71%, 95.07%, 93.79%.

Moreover, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is conducted with those synchrony measures as features. For the data set at hand, the frequency range (5-6Hz) yields the best accuracy for diagnosing AD, which lies within the classical theta band (4-8Hz). The corresponding classification error is 4.88% for directed transfer function (DTF) Granger causality measure. Interestingly, results show that EEG of AD patients is more synchronous than in healthy subjects within the optimized range 5-6Hz, which is in sharp contrast with the loss of synchrony in AD EEG reported in many earlier studies.

Towards this end, various deep learning models have been applied in this domain, typically relying on structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data from a single time point whereas neglecting the dynamic changes in brain structure over time. Current longitudinal studies inadequately explore disease evolution dynamics and are burdened by high computational complexity. This paper introduces a novel lightweight 3D convolutional neural network specifically designed to capture the evolution of brain diseases for modeling the progression of MCI. First, a longitudinal lesion feature selection strategy is proposed to extract core features from temporal data, facilitating the detection of subtle differences in brain structure between two time points. Next, to refine the model for a more concentrated emphasis on lesion features, a disease trend attention mechanism is introduced to learn the dependencies between overall disease trends and local variation features. Finally, disease prediction visualization techniques are employed to improve the interpretability of the final predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, precision, and F1 score.

One of the conditions that harms the brain most frequently is the disease called Alzheimer. The procedure, instead, does not have to succeed because the effects might be disastrous. Adults are affected by this condition. This disorder causes varied degrees of forgetfulness and even memory loss, depending on the health of every sufferer. These factors make it crucial to use brain CT scans to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the patient, classify memory loss, and define the patient's dementia stage. The most frequent neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer's disease. For patient care, especially in the early stages of the disease, an accurate Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is essential. Though several recent studies have used computers to detect Alzheimer's disease, the majority of machine detection methods are constrained by congenital findings. Patients can avoid irreversible brain damage from happening by taking preventive measures because of the severity, awareness, and progression issues. Alzheimer's disease's early phases can be recognised, but they cannot be predicted because prediction is only feasible before the sickness manifests itself. Diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer have all shown considerable promise in the treatment of deep learning (DL). An increasingly common technique for early Alzheimer's disease detection is deep learning (DL).

Therefore, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has become an urgent problem today. Studies have shown that mild cognitive impairment(MCI) is a state between Alzheimer's disease and normal, and the chance of it turning into Alzheimer's disease is high.

To improve the accuracy of AD predictions, we propose a network model based on multi-scale features and a dual self-attention mechanism (MSDA). This model integrates depthwise separable convolutions with an improved self-attention mechanism, thereby enhancing the classification ability for AD. First, MRI undergo head motion correction, image alignment, and skull stripping to enhance the model's capability to extract features related to AD lesions. Second, we designed a multi-scale convolutional network structure that utilizes depthwise separable convolution kernels of varying sizes, allowing the network to effectively capture multi-scale feature information from MRI and accurately identify lesion areas. Finally, we introduced a dual self-attention module, which includes channel self-attention and spatial self-attention, further augmenting the model's ability to extract lesion features by learning the differences in features across different categories of MRI in both channel and spatial dimensions. Experimental results indicate that the MSDA network model demonstrates exceptional performance in classifying normal controls (NC) and AD within the ADNI dataset, outperforming existing models in classification accuracy, performance, and generalization capability.

Furthermore, the PET image is noisy with low signal-to-noise ratio, and simultaneously the feature (metabolic abnormality) used for predicting AD in PET image is not always obvious. Therefore, a contrastive-based learning method is proposed to address the challenges of PET image inherently possessed. Firstly, the slices of 3D PET image are amplified by cropping the image of anchors (i.e., an augmented version of the same image) to generate extended training data. Meanwhile, contrastive loss is adopted to enlarge inter-class feature distances and reduce intra-class feature differences using subject fuzzy labels as supervised information. Secondly, we construct a double convolutional hybrid attention module to enhance the network to learn different perceptual domains where two convolutional layers with different convolutional kernels ($7\times 7$ and $5\times 5$) are constructed. Moreover, we recommend a diagnosis mechanism by analyzing the consistency of predicted result for PET slices alone with clinical neuropsychological assessment to achieve a better AD diagnosis.

Traditional CNNs can extract a good amount of low-level information in an image while failing to extract high-level minuscule particles, which is a significant challenge in detecting AD from MRI scans. To overcome this, we propose a novel Granular Feature Integration method to combine information extraction at different scales along with an efficient information flow, enabling the model to capture both broad and fine-grained features simultaneously.

The current DL-based AD diagnosis methods only focus on either AD classification or hippocampus segmentation independently, neglecting the correlation between the two tasks and lacking pathological interpretability. To address this issue, we propose a Reliable Hippo-guided Learning model for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis (RLAD), which employs multi-task learning for AD classification as a main task supplemented by hippocampus segmentation. More specifically, our model consists of 1) a hybrid shared features encoder that encodes local and global information in MRI to enhance the model's ability to learn discriminative features; 2) Task Specific Decoders to accomplish AD classification and hippocampus segmentation; and 3) Task Coordination module to correlate the two tasks and guide the classification task to focus on the hippocampus area. Our proposed RLAD model is evaluated on MRI scans of 1631 subjects from three independent datasets, including ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and HarP. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves the performance of AD classification and hippocampus segmentation with strong generalization capabilities.

Close monitoring is essential for slowing down the progression of AD. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely used for AD diagnosis and disease monitoring. Previous studies usually focused on extracting features from whole image or specific slices separately, but ignore the characteristics of each slice from multiple perspectives and the complementarity between features at different scales. In this study, we proposed a novel classification method based on the fusion of multi-view 2D and 3D convolutions for MRI-based AD diagnosis. Specifically, we first use multiple sub-networks to extract the local slice-level feature of each slice in different dimensions. Then a 3D convolution network was used to extract the global subject-level information of MRI. Finally, local and global information were fused to acquire more discriminative features. Experiments conducted on the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 dataset demonstrated the superiority of this proposed model over other state-of-the-art methods for their ability to discriminate AD and Normal Controls (NC). Our model achieves 90.2% and 85.2% of accuracy on ADNI-2 and ADNI-1 respectively, thus it can be effective in AD diagnosis.

Existing ways for identifying cases include medical history, cognitive testing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however due to lack of sensitivity and precision, there is a need for more efficient processes. Since AD progresses over time and patients at various stages require different therapies, early identification and categorization of AD's many phases utilizing neural network and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms may prove to be a successful strategy. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to construct a framework for detecting specific Alzheimer's disease symptoms from MRI scans. By taking into account the four phases of dementia and performing a precise diagnosis, the suggested method creates high-resolution disease probability mappings from the local brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and provides precise, intuitive representations of individual Alzheimer's patients.

Support vector machine (SVM) and its twin variant i.e., TWSVM tend to be biased towards the majority class samples, leading to misclassification of the minority class samples. TWSVM suffers from this biasness as it generates hyperplanes without considering preceding data information. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose bell-shaped fuzzy least square twin support vector machine for imbalance data (BSFLSTSVM-ID). The proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID allocates weight to the majority class samples through a novel membership function, namely, “class probability and bell-shaped” (CPBS). The CPBS function is amalgamation of class probability, bell-shaped function, and imbalance ratio of the dataset. The bell-shaped function's value diminishes as data points move farther away from the class center, reducing the influence of noise or outliers in constructing hyperplanes. To underscore the importance of samples from minority class, a weight of one is assigned to them. Furthermore, the proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID utilizes the conjugate gradient method to handle the challenge of matrix inversion. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on 59 UCI and KEEL datasets with imbalance ratios from 1 to 72.69. Additionally, we tested the proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID model's scalability on NDC datasets and applied it to diagnosing breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease using the BreakHis and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets, respectively. The results show that the proposed BSFLSTSVM-ID outperforms baseline models, highlighting its potential for tackling classification challenges in the biomedical domain.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2024.3421638","Science and Engineering Research Board; Mathematical Research Impact-Centric Support (MATRICS) scheme(grant numbers:MTR/2021/000787); National Supercomputing Mission under the Department of Science and Technology (DST); Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India(grant numbers:DST/NSM/R&D HPC Appl/2021/03.29); CSIR New Delhi, India(grant numbers:09/1022 (12437)/2021- EMR-I); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP220100803); Australian National Health and Medical Research Council(grant numbers:APP2021183); UTS Human-Centric Al Centre(grant numbers:2023--2031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10582532","Alzheimer's disease;bell-shaped function;breast cancer;conjugate gradient method;least square twin support vector machine (LSTSVM)","Support vector machines;Mathematical models;Noise measurement;Training;Alzheimer's disease;Gradient methods;Breast cancer;Gradient methods;Least squares approximations","","1","","38","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, directed connectivity matrices of 25 AD patients and 26 healthy subjects are processed and a number of meaningful graph theory metrics are studied. Our data show that functional networks of AD brains have significantly reduced global connectivity in alpha and beta bands (P <; 0.05). The AD brains have significantly higher local connectivity than healthy controls in alpha and beta bands. This decreased profile in global connectivity can be linked to compensatory increased local connectivity as a result of wide-spread decline in the long-range connections.

Graph-based representations of biological networks like PPI (protein-protein interaction) and PDA (protein disease associations) are used for disease prediction. To enable efficient use of machine learning algorithms for classification, these graphs must be converted to meaningful node embeddings that could capture topological and relational information from graphs. The purpose of this study is to assess how well the various embedding techniques work in representing disease-gene association networks and to evaluate their performance in downstream classification tasks. We applied three embedding techniques: Node2Vec, Fast Random Projection (FastRP), and GraphSAGE to convert the network into lowdimensional vector representations. These embeddings were then used as input features for machine learning classifiers: random forest, adaboost, Catboost and SVM. The models were trained to distinguish Alzheimer's disease-related genes from non-associated ones. We conducted a comparative analysis of different node embeddings and classifiers using various performance metrics. An evaluation of graph embeddings was conducted in the context of Alzheimer's disease classification, revealing their potential and effectiveness in capturing meaningful patterns for disease-gene association analysis.","","979-8-3315-4437-9","10.1109/ACCTHPA65749.2025.11168810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11168810","Alzheimer's disease;disease-gene association;Node2Vec;Fast Random Projection (FastRP);GraphSAGE","Proteins;Analytical models;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Performance metrics;Vectors;Communications technology;Biology;Alzheimer's disease;Random forests","","","","21","IEEE","24 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the lack of a cure for Alzheimer’s disease, early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for effective early interventions to slow disease progression. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a promising modality for early diagnosis, providing detailed insights into brain structure alterations associated with AD. However, domain shift due to variations in imaging protocols and data distribution among national cohorts remains a challenge for the application of MRI in clinical diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose AttCORAL, a novel Domain-Adaptive Attention Network for Early Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis, integrating attention mechanisms with Correlation Alignment (CORAL) loss to effectively mitigate domain discrepancy, enhancing the model’s robustness and generalization. We evaluate AttCORAL on two large-scale MRI datasets—Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Study (AIBL)—which differ in acquisition protocols and demographics. While these datasets provide a valuable basis for cross-cohort validation, we acknowledge that further multi-cohort studies are necessary to fully assess global generalizability. To ensure the reliability of our approach, we apply Grad-CAM to visualize the pathological brain regions most informative for our model’s predictions.

Some studies use a single template to identify neuroimaging biomarkers for the diagnosis of brain diseases. Compared to traditional single-template based approaches, a multi-template based approach can generally take into account more and richer information and relationships between subjects than a single-template based approach, so it can usually obtain better performance. However, most existing machine learning methods focus on finding the relationship between multiple templates, ignoring subject weights or noise effectiveness in the model building process. In fact, the representations of different subjects registered under multiple templates have different distinguishing discrimination capabilities. To solve this problem, we propose multi-template neuroimaging feature selection using weight-induced low-rank learning (WILL) for early diagnosis of AD. Specifically, we first use the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data to construct brain networks to obtain feature representations based on three different templates. Then, we adopt the WILL method to learn the weight of the subject through low-rank pattern matrix optimization, and select the most useful features for classification. Finally, based on the selected discriminative features, we apply the multi-kernel support vector machine as the classifier to get the result. Experimental results on a large number of data sets show that our proposed method is more accurate than the existing multi-template based methods, which confirms the superiority of our proposed method.","","978-1-6654-3712-7","10.1109/YAC53711.2021.9486487","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486487","Multi-templates;feature selection;fMRI;low-rank;Alzheimer’s disease","Neuroimaging;Support vector machines;Learning systems;Buildings;Machine learning;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Biomarkers","","1","","19","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four global metrics, network resilience, connection-level metrics and node versatility were used to distinguish between controls and patients. The results show that the main frequency bands that are different between MCI patients and controls are the  $\theta $  and low  $\alpha $  bands, and the differently affected brain areas are the frontal, left temporal and parietal areas.

TL greatly improves the detection of AD by analysing brain imaging data to identify early biomarkers, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and providing more precise predictions of disease progression compared to traditional methods. This article presents an ensemble methodology for TL models to detect Alzheimer's from brain MRIs, which can be helpful for medical practitioners. The framework starts by preprocessing MRI images and augmenting data. These images are used to train four different TL models. Each model is responsible for classifying the images into one of four stages of AD: ND, VMD, MD, and MoD. By combining these predictions through ensembling, we are able to achieve a final prediction that is highly accurate. This approach also helps to greatly reduce false positive rates when compared to using individual models alone. The ensemble model demonstrates exceptional performance with an overall accuracy of 98.91%, a specificity of 0.9965, and an AUC of 0.9830, highlighting its effectiveness in AD detection.

This research paper explores the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict AD in its early stages. Various ML algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and Voting classifiers were employed and optimized using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. Our models demonstrated commendable performance in AD prediction, achieving high Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score metrics. Beyond prediction, our research extended to disease progression forecasting, drug discovery, and image analysis, leveraging ML to unravel intricate disease dynamics and enhance diagnosis precision and treatment efficacy. The comprehensive framework outlined in this research facilitates accurate AD prediction and analysis, empowering clinicians to intervene earlier and mitigate the severe social, financial, and economic implications of AD. Adoption of our multifaceted classification scheme could transform healthcare, leading to more efficient disease management, improved patient outcomes, and reduced societal burdens associated with neurodegenerative diseases.","","979-8-3503-7281-6","10.1109/ICCPCT61902.2024.10673380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10673380","Decision Trees;Random Forests;Support Vector Machines;Gradient Boosting;Voting classifiers;Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)","Deep learning;Accuracy;Biological system modeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical services;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","1","","10","IEEE","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transition between normal aging and dementia, and approximately 10–15% of MCI patients progress to Alzheimer type dementia each year. Neurological examination, blood tests, cognitive tests, imaging methods, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid are performed for diagnosis of these diseases. Such techniques are not practical for large populations at risk, moreover test results are not sufficient to diagnose with high accuracy. In the proposed study, a decision support system that can make an automatic diagnosis is developed for objective and high accuracy diagnosis of AD and MCI. In the developed algorithm, electroencephalography (EEG) signals were filtered and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was applied to the filtered signals. Mean and standard deviations of the SDD coefficients and scalogram values were extracted as attributes, and with the subtracted attributes disease groups were classified using “Subspace K Nearest Neighbor (Subspace KNN)”. The subspace KNN classifier was trained with an accuracy of 88.9% and the trained system tested. As a result of this test, it was concluded that the disease groups can be seperated with 94.44% accuracy rate.","2687-7783","978-1-7281-2420-9","10.1109/TIPTEKNO.2019.8895256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8895256","EEG;Alzheimer's disease;mild cognitive impairment;CWT","Electroencephalography;Alzheimer's disease;Brain modeling;Continuous wavelet transforms;Scalp;Medical diagnostic imaging;Mathematical models","","1","","","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The onset of AD has a long preclinical stage. If doctors can make an initial diagnosis in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, it is possible to identify and screen those at a high-risk of developing full-blown AD, and thus the number of new AD patients can be reduced. However, there are problems with the medical datasets including AD data, such as insufficient number of samples and different data distributions. Transfer learning, which can effectively solve the problem of distribution discrepancy between training and test data and an insufficient number of target samples, has attracted increasing attention over recent years. In this paper, we propose a multi-source ensemble transfer learning (METL) approach by introducing ensemble learning and our tri-transfer model that uses Tri-Training, which ensures the transferability of source data by the tri-transfer model and high performance through ensemble learning. The experimental results on the benchmark and AD datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach has effective transferability, robustness, and feasibility, and is superior to existing algorithms. Based on METL, we propose an auxiliary diagnosis system for the initial diagnosis of AD, which helps doctors identify patients in the MCI stage as quickly as possible and with high accuracy so that measures can be taken to prevent or delay the occurrence of AD.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2020.2984601","Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61402397,61663046,71362016); Yunnan Provincial Young Academic and Technical Leaders Reserve Talents(grant numbers:2017HB005,2018HB027); Yunnan Science and Technology Fund(grant numbers:2017FA034); Yunnan Provincial E-Business Entrepreneur Innovation Interactive Space(grant numbers:2017DS012); Kunming Key Laboratory of E-Business and Internet Finance, Prominent Educator Program, Yunnan Provincial E-Business Innovation and Entrepreneurship Key Laboratory of colleges and universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9076609","Alzheimer’s disease;multi-source transfer learning;ensemble learning;auxiliary diagnosis system","Alzheimer's disease;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning;Task analysis","","35","","38","CCBY","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.","","978-1-5090-4171-8","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821697","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821697","Deep learning;Alzheimer's Disease;fMRI","Alzheimer's disease;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Biological neural networks;Neurons;Biomedical imaging","","116","1","14","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Alzheimer's disease divided stages of progression into four general stages on the basis of their symptoms. The early diagnosis helps to slow down the disease and reduce the costs of treatment. Since Alzheimer's disease has four stages of progression, the classification problems are those where a stage must be predicted in the case of an unequal number of instances of each class. This study has proposed the classification the stages of progression of Alzheimer's disease using four transfer learning models such as VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. The proposed models classify Alzheimer's disease into four stage of progression. The models gained an accuracy level of VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 model of 77.73%, 82.46%, 76.28% and 79.29%, respectively.

Therefore, the VGG19 model is the best model by considering the F1 score that means the VGG19 model is the best model in overall performance. Finally, this study measures the AUC value that indicates the ability to classify between classes. The results show that AUC value of MobileNetV2, Xception, ResNet50, and VGG19 are 0.9290, 0.9539, 0.7937, and 0.8037, respectively.

This study explores the application of deep learning models, specifically Inception V3 and AlexNet, for classifying MRI images into Alzheimer's severity classes: Mild Demented, Moderate Demented, NonDemented, and Very Mild Demented. Inception V3 and Alex net are lightweight models compared to other models (ResNet, VGG16, Efficient Net). These two models assess trade-offs between performance and Computational cost. A comprehensive dataset visualization revealed significant class imbalances, with distributions ranging from 1 % to 50 %. Data augmentation techniques such as shifts, rotations, and zooming were employed to address this, achieving a balanced class representation of $24-26 \%$. The models were evaluated on both original and augmented datasets to assess the impact of augmentation on performance. Inception V3 achieved 98% accuracy, 0.99 precision, 0.98 recall, and 0.98 F1-score, outperforming AlexNet, which reached 93% accuracy, 0.92 precision, 0.90 recall, and 0.90 F 1 -score. The study highlights that augmentation enhances sensitivity. Unlike prior studies that predominantly use a single deep learning approach, this research employs a comparative framework, evaluating both lightweight (AlexNet) and deep (Inception V3) architectures. Additionally, the effect of augmentation on class balance and model performance has been thoroughly analyzed, highlighting potential trade-offs in sensitivity and specificity. Despite improved sensitivity and reduced misclassification errors in augmented datasets, introducing synthetic patterns affected generalization.

However, the research is hindered by the unavoidable missing-data problem, i.e., one data modality was not acquired on some subjects due to various reasons. Although the missing data can be imputed using generative models, the imputation process may introduce unrealistic information to the classification process, leading to poor performance. In this paper, we propose the Disentangle First, Then Distill (DFTD) framework for AD diagnosis using incomplete multi-modality medical images. First, we design a region-aware disentanglement module to disentangle each image into inter-modality relevant representation and intra-modality specific representation with emphasis on disease-related regions. To progressively integrate multi-modality knowledge, we then construct an imputation-induced distillation module, in which a lateral inter-modality transition unit is created to impute representation of the missing modality. The proposed DFTD framework has been evaluated against six existing methods on an ADNI dataset with 1248 subjects.

In the proposed method, we design an optimized lightweight neural network for feature extraction on limited MRI data. Attention mechanism is adopted to fuse multi-slice features and ensure the consistency of results. For full use of MRI data, personalized weights are learned and applied to fuse the multi-view features of transverse plane, sagittal plane and coronal plane. The experimental results indicate that compare with state-of-the-art lightweight methods, the proposed multi-view method achieves good balance on parameters (3.75M) and FLOPs (4.45G).

First, multimodal medical images are produced by fusing structural information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of AD patients with brain activity information from positron emission tomography (PET) images. Then, a lightweight neural network is constructed by integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformer networks to extract essential features and classify Alzheimer's disease images.

To solve this problem, we propose a graph reasoning module (GRM), which can be directly incorporated into CNN-based AD detection models to simulate the underlying relationship between different brain regions and boost AD diagnosis performance. Specifically, in GRM, an adaptive graph Transformer (AGT) block is designed to adaptively construct a graph representation based on the feature map given by CNN, a graph convolutional network (GCN) block is adopted to update the graph representation, and a feature map reconstruction (FMR) block is built to convert the learned graph representation to a feature map.

Since the transition from early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) to late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) is irreversible and implies a significant change in a patient's condition, we focus on to the classification of these two stages in this work. In this study, atrophy values of 13 brain areas of 90 early mild cognitive impairment, 38 late mild cognitive impairment, 14 mild cognitive impairment participants were used in the diagnosis of the disease. Diagnosis groups have been classified with an accuracy of 68.8% as a result of data estimations obtained using classification algorithms.

Ensemble deep random vector functional link (edRVFL) network utilize the strength of two growing fields, i.e., deep learning and ensemble learning. However, edRVFL model doesn't consider the geometrical relationship of the data while calculating the final output parameters corresponding to each layer considered as base model. In the literature, graph embedded frameworks have been successfully used to describe the geometrical relationship within data. In this paper, we propose an extended graph embedded RVFL (EGERVFL) model that, unlike standard RVFL, employs both intrinsic and penalty subspace learning (SL) criteria under the graph embedded framework in its optimization process to calculate the model's output parameters. The proposed shallow EGERVFL model has only single hidden layer and hence, has less representation learning. Therefore, we further develop an ensemble deep EGERVFL (edEGERVFL) model that can be considered a variant of edRVFL model. Unlike edRVFL, the proposed edEGERVFL model solves graph embedded based optimization problem in each layer and hence, has better generalization performance than edRVFL model. We evaluated the proposed approaches for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and furthermore on UCI datasets.

This study proposes BrainNet3D, an optimized 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) model, to classify Alzheimer's stages-Cognitive Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-using volumetric MRI data. The framework incorporates advanced preprocessing techniques, including Bayes Wavelet Transform for noise reduction and improved fuzzy c-means clustering for segmentation. Post-processing enhancements, such as gamma correction and Gaussian blur, further improve image clarity. The modified BrainNet3D architecture integrates dropout regularization, dynamic padding, and expanded convolutional blocks to enhance accuracy and scalability. Evaluated on the ADNI dataset, the model achieved a test accuracy of 96.05%, an average F1-score of 95.91 %, and robust performance across CN, MCI, and AD classifications. It outperformed state-of-the-art models, validating its effectiveness for early-stage AD diagnosis. BrainNet3D offers a scalable and automated diagnostic solution, supporting timely clinical interventions and reducing diagnostic burdens.

However, the effects of implicit spurious correlations caused by implicit non-neuropathological information are difficult to be analyzed statistically. In this paper, we investigate shortcut learning of implicit spurious correlations in sMRI-based preclinical AD detection with classification performance and neuropathological validation. We evaluate two AD-related supervised pretraining tasks (i.e., AD detection, multiclassification) and three self-supervised pretraining tasks (i.e., auto-encoding, denoising, mask reconstruction) on removal of implicit spurious correlations. In contrast to earlier works in other performance metrics, we do not observe that self-supervised pretraining tasks achieve a significant performance improvement in mitigating implicit spurious correlation. Instead, we find that AD-related supervised tasks, especially multiclassification, are effective for deep models to model the severity of disease and capture neuropathological features. Moreover, we conduct the same experiment on another dataset in mild cognitive impairment detection.

Advancement in technology has brought about a surge in sophisticated computer-aided diagnostic tools involving Machine Learning (ML) approaches to classify different forms of dementia accurately. Despite this, our healthcare system is facing a scarcity of reliable methods that can accurately classify Alzheimer’s with FTD having similar clinical symptoms. In the proposed work, we introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture-based model, designed specifically for multi-class classification tasks using traditionally extracted features. We evaluate the proposed model and demonstrate its effectiveness as compared to leading state-of-the-art models. Our method differentially diagnoses patients with neurological diseases (AD and FTD), and healthy patients with high accuracy and much lower computational cost than image-based methods. Our work achieves a higher accuracy of 95.39% on a publicly accessible EEG dataset, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.","","979-8-3503-7687-6","10.1109/CVMI61877.2024.10782448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782448","Alzheimer’s disease (AD);Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD);Deep Learning;Electroencephalogram (EEG)","Neurological diseases;Adaptation models;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Medical services;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease","","","","26","IEEE","11 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the existing approaches underestimate the complexity of the interactions among factors that cause AD. To take full appreciate of these complexity interactions, we propose BIGFormer, a graph Transformer with local structural awareness, for AD diagnosis and identification of pathogenic mechanisms. Specifically, the factors interaction graph is constructed with lesion brain regions and risk genes as nodes, where the connection between nodes intuitively represents the interaction between nodes. After that, a perception with local structure awareness is built to extract local structure around nodes, which is then injected into node representation. Then, the global reliance inference component assembles the local structure into higher-order structure, and multi-level interaction structures are jointly aggregated into a classification projection head for disease state prediction. Experimental results show that BIGFormer demonstrated superiority in four classification tasks on the AD neuroimaging initiative dataset and proved to identify biomarkers closely intimately related to AD.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3442468","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972226,61902216); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); DOD ADNI(grant numbers:W81XWH-12-2-0012); National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; AbbVie; Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; Araclon Biotech; BioClinica; Biogen; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; CereSpir, Inc.; Cogstate; Eisai Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; EuroImmun; Roche; Genentech; Fujirebio; GE Healthcare; IXICO; Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC.; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development LLC.; Lumosity; H.

The buildup of amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain leads to the demise of brain cells and the disruption of neuronal connections, ultimately causing the disease. Common symptoms of AD include memory loss, confusion, and difficulty communicating. The suggested improvement entails employing a deep CNN for the automated extraction of features from MRI scans. Deep learning models have achieved astounding results in a variety of picture categorization tasks in recent years. In my research, I examine how the cutting-edge EfficientNetB0 architecture could be used to achieve high-performance picture classification. EfficientNetB0 has gained significant attention due to its efficient and effective design, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments without compromising accuracy. The proposed approach combines the power of EfficientNetB0 with global average pooling and a dense layer to predict class labels. By leveraging the pre-trained weights of EfficientNetB0, the model benefits from the learned representations of a diverse image dataset, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen data. Fine-tuning is employed to adapt the model to the image classification task. Results showed that the suggested method worked well, with an overall accuracy of 97% across four courses. This research makes a valuable contribution to the domain of image classification by showcasing the capabilities of the EfficientNetB0 architecture and its potential to achieve high-performance results.","","979-8-3503-4438-7","10.1109/ICAICCIT60255.2023.10466013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10466013","Dementia;Alzheimer’s disease (AD);magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);image classification;convolutional neural network (CNN)","Proteins;Neurological diseases;Adaptation models;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","","1","","23","IEEE","20 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is still no cure for this disease. To determine its nosogenesis and conduct early prevention and intervention, more and more efforts have been paid to this area. In order to clarify the research trend, researchers have applied traditional bibliometrics methods. However, these methods are hard to find research topics. Therefore, this paper conducts the trend analysis on Alzheimer's disease based on topic model. We crawled 68647 paper abstracts from pubmed database of NCBI, and built an LDA topic model. Gibbs sampling was adopted to estimate the parameters. Finally, 20 topics are determined based on perplexity. We further categorized these topics into 6 research areas. Besides, we found that the research on β-amyloid has declined since 2015 according to topic intensity.","","978-1-6654-7081-0","10.1109/BDAI56143.2022.9862704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9862704","Alzheimer's disease;Topic model;Research trend;Gibbs sampling","Analytical models;Parameter estimation;Databases;Bibliometrics;Big Data;Market research;Data models","","","","16","IEEE","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
