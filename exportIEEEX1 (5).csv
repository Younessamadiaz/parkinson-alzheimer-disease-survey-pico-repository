The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2549363","7th Framework Program; European Commission(grant numbers:EU-Grant-611005-PredictND); Provincial Natural Science Foundation of Fujian, China(grant numbers:2016J05157); ADNI; NIH(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); National Institute on Aging; NIBIB; Pfizer Inc., Wyeth Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co.

Actual AD imaging datasets challenge the construction of reliable longitudinal models owing to imaging modality uncertainty. In addition, they are still unable to retain or obtain important information during disease progression from previous to followup time points. For example, the output values of current gates in recurrent models should be close to a specific value that indicates the model is uncertain about retaining or forgetting information. In this study, we propose a model which can extract and constrain each modality into a common representation space to capture intermodality interactions among different modalities associated with modality uncertainty to predict AD progression. In addition, we provide an auxiliary function to enhance the ability of recurrent gate robustly and effectively in controlling the flow of information over time using longitudinal data. We conducted comparative analysis on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Our model outperformed other methods across all evaluation metrics.

The work presented in this paper assesses the utility of image processing on the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans to estimate the probability of early diagnosis of dementia in Alzheimer's Disease.

Early detection of AD symptoms is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we present a novel approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the detection of Alzheimer's symptoms from neuroimaging data. The CNN model was trained on a diverse dataset of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, comprising both healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at various stages.

Current clinical techniques are expensive, laborious, and invasive, which hinders comprehensive studies on Alzheimer's biomarkers and the development of efficient devices for Point-of-Care testing (POCT) applications. To address these limitations, researchers have been investigating various biosensing techniques. Unfortunately, these methods have not been commercialized due to several drawbacks, such as low efficiency, reproducibility, and the lack of accurate identification of AD markers.

The relentless deterioration of AD symptoms makes it increasingly difficult for the patient to perform essential functions, leading to impaired immunity as well as accidents. Early diagnosis facilitates prompt therapeutic intervention to slow down symptoms and improve their quality of life. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can precisely examine brain imagery extracted from various imaging modalities. In this study, a parallel path deep CNN is employed to distinguish several early stages of AD from brain MRI scans. Parallel path CNNs offer a distinct advantage in image classification by simultaneously extracting features from multiple pathways, as opposed to single path CNNs that only operate with one pathway. The proposed network thus allows the integration of both local and global features, providing a comprehensive representation of the MRI images for an accurate classification of early AD stages.

While advancements in treatment hold promise, early detection remains pivotal, demanding innovative technological solutions to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. Utilizing cognitive and neuroimaging data, researchers employ computational models, particularly artificial intelligence systems, to predict AD progression risk. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) provides a valuable dataset for such research; however, challenges persist, notably in handling missing data within longitudinal studies. This paper investigates the impact of imputation techniques on the performance of longitudinal deep learning methods for AD progression prediction. Four models-RNN, LSTM, DeepRNN, and ODE-RGRU-are evaluated with six imputation strategies, encompassing both external (five of them) overtures and an internal approach. External imputation methods of varying complexity are contrasted against the internal imputation capabilities of DeepRNN and ODE-RGRU. Our results highlight the efficacy of sophisticated methods like ODE-RGRU and DeepRNN, particularly when coupled with external imputation (ODE-RGRU with median imputation reached an mAUC value of $\mathbf{0.9}\pm \mathbf{0.002}$, and DeepRNN using MissForest imputation reached an mAUC of $\mathbf{0.91} \pm \mathbf{0.004}$). The findings underscore the importance of robust imputation techniques in enhancing the accuracy of AD progression prediction models, offering valuable insights for future research and clinical practice. These insights extend beyond AD research, particularly benefiting the burgeoning field of telemedicine, where missing data issues frequently occur.","","979-8-3503-7800-9","10.1109/MetroXRAINE62247.2024.10796324","Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 AG024904); DOD ADNI Department of Defense(grant numbers:W81XWH-122-0012); National Institute on Aging; National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; AbbVie; Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation; BioClinica, Inc.; Biogen; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; Eisai Inc.; Eli Lilly and Company; F.

It is most common forms of dementia without any proper cure. However, early diagnosis and treatment might slow down the symptoms and improve the lifestyle of the individual. The most common techniques to identify the neurological disorders are imaging of the brain regions, namely, CT, MRI, PET, etc. The learning approaches, such as Deep Learning and Machine Learning are identified to be effective in analyzing these images to provide better accuracies in detecting the AD. In this study, four versions of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to classify AD and Control cases. Further, the Kapur’s thresholding technique is also implemented to segment the images for improving the classification accuracy of AD.

Depending on the patient’s data, the model employs extensive data and effective algorithms to differentiate matter phases. A confusion matrix evaluates the model and other vital statistical measures like accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Thus, recognizing the confusion matrix values means that diagonal values 507 for those with Moderate and 525 for severe Alzheimer’s disease are highly accurate. These values translate into a large number of correct predictions. However, there are some misclassifications, especially between adjacent phases; in this case, Moderate Alzheimer’s is classified as Preclinical and observed in 67 patients. However, with all these limitations, the general model's accuracy is impressive, instilling confidence in its performance. The values obtained in the macro average show a roughly equal match of the performance by achieving accuracy, recall, and an F1 score of up to 92. 12%, 92. 58%, and 92. 19% respectively.

APOE e4 allele (E4) is also known to be associated with increased risk for AD. Objectives: The goal of this study is to examine the association of Aβ deposition to cortical thickness (CoTh), in healthy control (CN), early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI) and AD stages by controlling for E4 load, both in regional and hemispheric levels, and to interpret patterns of different brain regions based on their correlation performance among the four groups. Methods: We analyzed Amyloid PET Scan, Volumetric MRI (CoTh) data from participants in the ADNIGO/ADNI2 cohort whose APOE gene information are available. Statistical analysis includes Pearson partial correlations, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with post-hoc Tukey HSD. Complete-linkage hierarchical clustering analysis was further performed to group brain regions based on their significant correlation performance. Results: 25 out of 68 regions showed significant correlation of Aβ load and CoTh at least in one diagnostic group. Furthermore, 6 main clusters were recognized based on the performance patterns of those 25 regions across 4 diagnosis groups. Conclusion: Our major finding clustered the cortical regions into 2 general groups, positive correlation in CN or AD, and negative correlation in EMCI and/or LMCI, and 6 more specific groups were then recognized, confirming the interplay between of Aβ and CoTh in the different stages of the disease.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217994","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217994","Alzheimer's disease;MRI;PET;APOE gene;Pearson partial correlation;neuroimaging;clustering","Correlation;Dementia;Positron emission tomography;Neuroimaging;Atrophy","","6","","25","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many deep learning techniques have been proposed to diagnose AD using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Predicting AD using 2D slices extracted from 3D MRI scans is challenging as the inter-slice information gets lost. To this end, we propose a novel and lightweight framework termed ‘Biceph-net’ for AD diagnosis using 2D MRI scans that models both the intra-slice and inter-slice information. ‘Biceph-net’ has been experimentally shown to perform similar to other Spatio-temporal neural networks while being computationally more efficient. Biceph-net is also superior in performance compared to vanilla 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD diagnosis using 2D MRI slices. Biceph-net also has an inbuilt neighbourhood-based model interpretation feature that can be exploited to understand the classification decision taken by the network. Biceph-net experimentally achieves a test accuracy of 100% in the classification of Cognitively Normal (CN) vs AD, 98.16% for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) vs AD, and 97.80% for CN vs MCI vs AD.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2022.3174033","National Supercomputing Mission; DST and Miety, Government of India(grant numbers:DST/NSM/R&D,HPC Appl/2021/03.29); Department of Science and Technology(grant numbers:SB/S2/RJN-001/2016); Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, India; Extra Mural Research(grant numbers:22(0751)/17/EMR-II); Science and Engineering Research Board(grant numbers:ECR/2017/000053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9772407","Alzheimer's disease;deep learning;disease classification;feature embedding;similarity learning","Magnetic resonance imaging;Training;Bioinformatics;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease;Three-dimensional displays","Humans;Aged;Alzheimer Disease;Neurodegenerative Diseases;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks, Computer;Neuroimaging","29","","37","IEEE","10 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Individuals affected by AD struggle with cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, and behaviour, which in turn disrupts their daily activities. Current methods for creating medical concept structures from various data sources— such as ICU and outpatient clinical records—often fall short in capturing the full complexity of disease progression. The primary issues include limitations in attention weight learning and restricted handling of data sources. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel approach that combines three key techniques: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for reducing dimensionality, the (SMOTE) Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for enhancing data through augmentation and addressing class imbalance, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) for classification purposes.

This decline manifests in various mental faculties such as attention, memory, and higher-order cognitive functions, severely impacting an individual's ability to comprehend information, acquire new knowledge, and communicate effectively. One of the tasks influenced by cognitive impairments is handwriting. By analyzing specific features of handwriting, including pressure, velocity, and spatial organization, researchers can detect subtle changes that may indicate early-stage cognitive impairments, particularly AD. Recent developments in classical artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise in detecting AD through handwriting analysis. However, as the dataset size increases, these AI approaches demand greater computational resources, and diagnoses are often affected by limited classical vector spaces and feature correlations. Recent studies have shown that quantum computing technologies, developed by harnessing the unique properties of quantum particles such as superposition and entanglement, can not only address the aforementioned problems but also accelerate complex data analysis and enable more efficient processing of large datasets. In this study, we propose a variational quantum classifier with fewer circuit elements to facilitate early AD diagnosis based on handwriting data.

This study proposed an efficient method of applying a graph convolutional network (GCN) on the early prediction of AD. Methods: We proposed a univariate neurodegeneration biomarker (UNB) based GCN semi-supervised classification framework. We generated UNB by comparing the similarity of individual morphological atrophy pattern and the atrophy pattern of  $\text{A}\beta +$  AD group according to the brain morphological abnormalities induced by AD. For the GCN semi-supervised classification model, we took the UNBs of individuals as the features of nodes and constructed the weight of edges according to the similarity of phenotypic information between individuals, which explored the essential features of individuals through spectral graph convolution. The attention module was constructed and embedded into the GCN framework, which may refine the input morphological features to highlight the main impact of AD on the cerebral cortex and weaken the instability caused by individual diversities, thereby identifying the significant ROIs affected by AD and improving the classification accuracy. Results: We tested the UNB-GCN framework on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The estimated minimum sample sizes were 156, 349 and 423 for the longitudinal  $\text{A}\beta +$  AD,  $\text{A}\beta +$  mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and  $\text{A}\beta +$  cognitively unimpaired (CU) groups, respectively. And the proposed UNB-GCN framework combined with the attention module can effectively improve the classification performance with 93.90% classification accuracy for AD vs. CU and 82.05% for AD vs. MCI on the validation set. Conclusion: The proposed UNB measures were superior to the conventional volume measures in describing the AD-induced cerebral cortex morphological changes. And the UNB-GCN framework combined with attention module may effectively improve the classification performance between MCI subjects and AD patients.

This paper proposes a new method for Alzheimer's disease classification: adding MRI images of the hippocampus to the input image, using the pre-trained DenseNet for feature extraction, and adding the attention mechanism (DenseNet-AM).

It is valuable to reveal the correlations between the plasma NFL levels and neurodegeneration, especially hippocampal deformations at the preclinical stage. The negative correlation between plasma NFL levels and hippocampal volumes has been documented. However, the relationship between the plasma NFL levels and the hippocampal morphometry details at the preclinical stage is still elusive. This study seeks to demonstrate the capacity of our proposed surface-based hippocampal morphometry system to discern the plasma NFL positive (NFL+ > 41.9 pg/L) level and plasma NFL negative (NFL– < 41.9 pg/L) level and illustrate its superiority to the hippocampal volume measurement by drawing the cohort of 154 cognitively unimpaired (CU) middle aged and elderly adults. We also apply this morphometry measure and a proposed sparse coding-based classification algorithm to classify CU individuals with NFL+ and NFL− levels. Experimental results show that the proposed hippocampal morphometry system offers stronger statistical power to discriminate CU subjects with NFL+ and NFL− levels, comparing with the hippocampal volume measure. Furthermore, this system can discriminate plasma NFL levels in CU individuals (Accuracy = 0.86).

However, the inherent variability between multimodal neuroimages hinders the effective fusion of multimodal features. Moreover, achieving reliable and interpretable diagnoses in the field of multimodal fusion remains challenging. To address them, we propose a novel multimodal diagnosis network based on multi-fusion and disease-induced learning (MDL-Net) to enhance early AD diagnosis by efficiently fusing multimodal data. Specifically, MDL-Net proposes a multi-fusion joint learning (MJL) module, which effectively fuses multimodal features and enhances the feature representation from global, local, and latent learning perspectives. MJL consists of three modules, global-aware learning (GAL), local-aware learning (LAL), and outer latent-space learning (LSL) modules. GAL via a self-adaptive Transformer (SAT) learns the global relationships among the modalities. LAL constructs local-aware convolution to learn the local associations. LSL module introduces latent information through outer product operation to further enhance feature representation. MDL-Net integrates the disease-induced region-aware learning (DRL) module via gradient weight to enhance interpretability, which iteratively learns weight matrices to identify AD-related brain regions.

They were asked to mount the device on their foot and walk along a straight line of 40 meters at normal speed. The stride detection algorithm, consisting of procedures of data collection, signal preprocessing, and stride detection, has been developed for acquiring gait feature information from acceleration signals. The advantages of this wearable gait analysis device include the following: 1) It can be used anywhere without any external device, and 2) the stride detection algorithm can acquire gait feature information from acceleration signals automatically and effectively. Experimental results show that the AD patients exhibited a significantly shorter mean stride length and slower mean gait speed than those of the healthy controls. No significant differences in mean stride frequency and mean cadence were observed in the two groups. The variability in the percentage of the stance phase of the AD patients was slightly greater than that of the healthy controls.

One who is diagnosed as an Alzheimer's disease patient may has many symptoms, such as deterioration of memory and language. Once those symptoms was noticed, they usually can survive 4 to 20 years. So far, Alzheimer's disease has become the sixth leading cause of death, and it has become a worldwide health and social challenge. Traditional methods of diagnosing AD and mild cognitive impairment(MCI), mostly depend on capturing features from variable modalities of brain image data. It is a big challenge to pick out the MCI from normal controller (NC) and AD, especially for those who are lacking experience. In this article, we employ deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to extract the most useful features of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Firstly, the structural MRls are pre-processed in a strict pipeline. Then, instead of parcellating regions of interest, we re-slice each volume, and put the resliced images into a DCNN directly. Finally, four stages of Alzheimer's are identified, and the average accuracy is 94.5% for NC versus LMCI, 96.9% for NC versus AD, 97.2% for LMCI and AD, 97.81 % for EMCI versus AD, 94.8% for LMCI versus EMCI.

It also analyses input from the outside world. The brain shows structural and functional changes because of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). AD often starts off slowly and gets worse over time. It is the underlying factor in 60-70% of dementia cases. Memory loss, paranoia, and delusions in the short term thoughts are symptoms of AD, a degenerative neurological disorder that is often misdiagnosed as stress or ageing-related symptoms. Because AD is chronic, it might last for a huge time or for the rest of life. Early AD therapy is more efficient and results in minor harm in comparison with medication administered later in the disease's progression. Alzheimer's diagnosis can be done using different scans such as PET, MRI or CT. Traditional medical testing takes a long time, and cannot predict early warning signs. Machine learning models can be used for early detection and to achieve efficient classification accuracy. In this paper, for efficient detection of Alzheimer's disease, the most effective parameters are considered using 2 different datasets: Longitudinal dataset which contains text values, and dataset OASIS which has MRI images. OASIS Longitudinal dataset runs on 14 Machine Learning algorithms including Random Forest Algorithm giving a maximum accuracy of 92.1385% and KNN Algorithm with a baseline accuracy of 47.1910%. MRI images are run on different Transfer learning models with the best accuracy got from the InceptionV3 model and ADAM as Optimizer.","","978-1-6654-5699-9","10.1109/CSITSS57437.2022.10026365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026365","Alzheimer's disease Detection;Machine Learning;OASIS CSV Dataset;Optimizer;ADAM;RMSprop","Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Brain modeling;Prediction algorithms;Alzheimer's disease","","15","","26","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop an Alzheimer's disease prediction model that can assist medical professionals in predicting the status of the disease based on medical data about patients. The sample medical data we use has five important attributes, namely, gender, age, genetic causes, brain injury, and vascular disease. The sample also contains values for seventeen different patients that represent seventeen medical cases. We perform decision tree induction to create a decision tree that corresponds to the sample data. We base our selection of nodes in the tree on the Entropy or Information Gain computed for each attribute. At each level of the tree, the right attribute is chosen as a splitting attribute if it gives us the highest Information Gain.","","978-1-4799-3999-2","10.1109/CSIT.2014.6805989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6805989","Alzheimer disease;data mining;decision tree induction;classification","Decision trees;Alzheimer's disease;Equations;Bismuth;Medical diagnostic imaging;Genetics","","35","","16","IEEE","1 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research focuses on processing MRI brain scans through various image processing techniques, such as segmentation and bicubic interpolation, to enhance visual clarity and extract meaningful features. Models such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are employed for classification, with a particular emphasis on detecting early brain atrophy and vascular changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. The research demonstrates that combining MRI data with machine learning models can significantly improve the accuracy of early Alzheimer's diagnosis. This potentially aids in early intervention and better patient care management. Findings hold promise for advancing early diagnosis and treatment, enhancing AD patients' quality of life.","2831-3399","979-8-3315-1142-5","10.1109/ICITR64794.2024.10857776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10857776","Alzheimer's disease diagnosis;machine learning;MRI imaging","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Magnetic resonance imaging;Machine learning;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Reliability;Alzheimer's disease;Principal component analysis","","2","","13","IEEE","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
